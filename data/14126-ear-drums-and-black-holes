For a while, Starkey fit this profile. The Phillybased producer's early releases (\"Corner Store Riddim\", \"Pins\", \"Bounce\") sounded like a dry run for a new, heavy American take on classic 2step. Starkey's debut album, Ephemeral Exhibits, put the gloss on his street bass sound: The beats stayed massive, but rave pianos, electro synths, and ghostly, pitchedup divas gave them a bright neon hue. Starkey's gift for matching melodic complexity to his forceful rhythms became clear tracks that could've otherwise just sounded huge wound up feeling moving as well. With his second album, Ear Drums and Black Holes, Starkey amplifies those tendencies every beat is matched to a soulful melody.Granted, it's a particularly wonky kind of soul. Starkey's compositions are filtered through the heavy buzzes and oscillating warbles of the postJoker sound. So you get these soaring, emotive melodies, with 2step beats loosely translated into contemporary R&B (\"Neck Snap\") or American club rap (\"Murderous Words\") that unfold into ultradense counterpoints between sweetly toned harmonies and clobbering lowend. And the tracks get more compelling the further those roles are blurred: The fundamentals of great bass music rely on every component reacting to and building on the rhythm, and in the purplish \"11th Hour\" or the raveevoking \"Multidial\", multiple rhythms merge into a big wave of percussive harmony. The effect is nothing short of euphoric.Yet for all its epic sweep, there's a certain lightheartedness and a sly sense of humor here a selfaware sense of playing with stylistic expectations. When the Underworldesque \"Fourth Dimension\" baits the listener with a 4/4 throb in its first minute, only to switch to a gelatinous bassline, it's a great joke; when Starkey reincorporates the falsestart melody into the track midway through, it's a stroke of brilliance. And even the AutoTune makes an odd sort of sense, cropping up on \"Spacecraft\" and \"Alienstyles\" where it feels right at home in the tracks' subtly tongueincheek scifi futurism.Starkey's style is rich with crossover potential, yet it could use a bit more adaptation to the hiphop influences with which it feels made to fuse. Maybe it comes down to picking the right MC for the job \"Bounce\" combined dubstep with Young Dro's hook and made it work, after all but Starkey's beats accommodate Londoner P Money's rapidfire grime flow (\"Numb\") more comfortably than the simple, halting cadence of San Antonio indierapper Cerebral Vortex (\"Murderous Words\"; \"Club Games\"). Still, the job of bringing dubstep to the States has a worthy heir in Starkey, an ambassador of the style that proves American crowds don't have to stick with the hard and bleak. "}
