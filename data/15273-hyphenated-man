That's because both of Mike Watt's overarching ideas lend themselves to short, pithy songs rather than bloated suites or pompous narratives. Watt's guides are the small, detailed characters in the work of 15th century painter Hieronymus Bosch, and the minimal punk of his own pioneering band the Minutemen. Basing each of the album's 30 songs on a Bosch character (and giving them names like \"JugFootedMan\" and \"ConfusedPartsMan\"), Watt wrote everything in Minutemen \"econo\" mode, using late bandmate D. Boon's guitar. The goal, he says, was to make \"one big work out of a bunch of little ones.\" Judged on that scale, HyphenatedMan is a fullon success. The way Watt and his band the Missingmen blast through each taut musical nugget evokes early Minutemen albums such as The Punch Line and What Makes a Man Start Fires? As on those classics, each track fires by so quickly, you might not absorb one before you can catch up to the next. Nearly every song uses sharp turns, gruff energy, and snapping beats, making them all echo each other like rhyming lines in a poem. And like Bosch's characters, Watt's 30 \"men\" feel like brothers, united by an artistic cause. What gives those brothers personality and keeps HyphenatedMan from being just a Minutemen nostalgia trip is the way Watt injects himself into every moment. His hardworking, artpunkinaflannelshirt persona courses through each syllable of his Dadaish lyrics, and his voice stretches to match the music's spilling energy. \"Panderin' to work the shill/ Procurin' ink for the quill,\" he wryly sings about \"BirdintheHelmetMan\". Later he grunts through a dizzying portrait of the hardluck \"BellyStabbedMan\": \"A belly with ears stuck to some legs/ No arms or chest not even a head/ Stabbed with truth, fuckin' gets bled!\" Much of HyphenatedMan has that kind of blunt, unblinking tone. It sounds like Watt is using Bosch's figures to confront some hard truths, but he does so in a spry, often joyous way. That's especially impressive given how sentimental this album could've been. After Boon's passing in 1985, Watt didn't listen to the Minutemen much until the We Jam Econo documentary was made in 2005. But rather than getting him down, revisiting his past has given Watt an electric charge. While his solo work has often been inspired, on HyphenatedMan he sounds thoroughly possessed. At age 53, after threeplus decades building a singular DIY career, Mike Watt might have just made his best postMinutemen work. "}
