Though audiences were used to the skittering, rapid fire electronic beats, video game sound effects and tinny keyboards of his prior releases, and despite his prior release, an EP he called Big Loada, garnering him the most critical acclaim of his entire career, the Squarepusher swapped genres. He released Music is Rotted One Note, a strictly jazz affair with no sequencers or breakbeats to be found, a total shock to fans and critics alike. Tom Jenkinson's gone in a similar direction on his new seven track EP, Budakhan Mindphone. It's slightly less jazzy than Rotted One Note almost a combination of Squarepusher's two sounds. The opening track, \"Iambic 5 Poetry,\" is a latenite '70s gangsta shuffle, boasting warm, orchestra emulating keyboards, gentle feedback and a glockenspiel. It perfectly encapsulates the feel of a lonely and humid summer night. This is the shit that's gonna get sampled by rap groups in 2015. Meanwhile, tracks like the ambient \"The Tide,\" the swaggering, dischordant tones and tunnel reverb of \"Splask\" and the junk rhythm fest of \"Gong Acid\" show Jenkinson's horizons are ever expanding. Budakhan Mindphone proves that Squarepusher clearly intends to keep on keepin' on, making new noise the likes of which the world may otherwise never have heard. "}
