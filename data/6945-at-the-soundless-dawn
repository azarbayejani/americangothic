Their music is slow, humorless, and uneventful. Looking for gimmicks? Try elsewhere. Though their live performances can be VoiceofGod loud, recorded sound has a disappointing, mellowing effect on bands like Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai, City of Caterpillar, and ambientmetal label Neurot interlopers Red Sparowes. Success stories are few. When Explosions in the Sky scored a bigbudget Hollywood film, Friday Night Lights, it was a sort of backhanded compliment: The band, who'd theretofore propagated unwieldily large instrumentals, were sought after to make cool background noise. So how is a band to survive making such underappreciated, often derided, music? One way is to do what Red Sparowes do, which is infuse their lumbering instrumentals with idiosyncratic guitar licks that poach from forbidden genres. You know, those emphasizing concision, catchiness, and ease of digestion.At the Soundless Dawn isn't exactly pop. In fact, the album is all instrumental postrock in its viscera, from the swollen, hourplus runtime (avg. song = nine minutes) to the ponderous doses of reverb. But debone these meaty cuts and you'll find some unexpected stylizing. Froghopping discreetly from soggy new wave to ecclesiastic country twang, Red Sparowes find a way to the beat tedium inherent to their genus then ride it for so long that...are you paying attention? \"Mechanical Sounds Cascaded Through the City Walls and Everyone Reveled in Their Ignorance\" tops 11 minutes but rocks the silo for a toobrief spell, bending and sliding like a syrupsipping Ry Cooder. But there's still those other 10 minutes to account for, and the buildup/comedown are the means that don't justify the ends. Somewhattitle track \"The Soundless Dawn Came Alive as Cities Began to Mark the Horizon\" sobs just fine without vocals, thanks, awaiting its emo (not emo) troubadour. (He never shows.) \"A Brief Moment of Clarity Before the Deafening Hum, But it Was Too Late\" flirts with awesome Unwound sewer grooves, but it's too goodnatured to do any damage, dressing its sludgy privates in a Big Distorted Chorus. Red Sparowes treat their genre like a menial internship: It's entrÂŽe to bigger, better things, right? Or maybe they really are passionate about instrumental postrock. Beats filing, I guess. But at these lugubrious tempos and this album's interminable length listening is a lot like busy work: redundant and largely unrewarding. "}
