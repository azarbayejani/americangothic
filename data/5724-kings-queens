{"label":" Thrill Jockey","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/5648/homepage_large.ee72fe00.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ryan Dombal","artist":"The National Trust","title":"Kings & Queens","text":" Google \"indie rock\" and you'll summon more than nine million matches. Even \"indie metal,\" \"indie folk,\" and \"indie jazz\" ratchet up at least 200,000 hits each. But \"indie funk\"? Just 26,100. \"Indie r&b;\" fares even worse, at under a thousand connections. This dearth of DIY lovermen and horn snappers is unfortunate, but it makes sense considering the notion of indieness is often typified by a subversion of the talentequalssuccess trajectory. With outlandish, popular champions from Prince to George Clinton to Rick James, funk seems to require an acute set of raw chops and shameless starquality to truly transcend. Thrill Jockey's National Trust try for an elusive indiefunk maneuver with their sophomore album, but the Chicagobased duo largely succumbs to the pitfalls of their lonely genre. Stumbling through twisty bass 'n' falsetto excursions, the band lacks the adequate songwriting gusto and egofueled panache to turn its sexedup conga jams into true bottomdwelling fiends. Give them credit, though these guys are really going for it, indie ethos be damned. Just one look at the album's cover, which features main men Neil Rosario and Mark Henning striking silly poses in front of a couple pink elevators, makes their commitment to the soul spectacle apparent. Unfortunately, their idea of spectacle isn't exactly spectacular. With Kings & Queens, the Trust siphon out the psychtinged 70s singer/songwriter leanings of their 2002 debut, Dekaggar, keeping only the elements that make asses move. The pair's penchant for overorchestration Dekaggar infamously took over 500 hours to record remains, and more often than not, hinders Kings' libidinous ambitions. Clearly, these boys can't grasp the concept of \"say when.\" Just sample the stupidlong instrument list: bongos, congas, flute, piccolo, synth, clavinet, vibes, wood block, and glockenspiel. If R. Kelly has proven anything, it's that a classic funk can be gleaned from the sound of a single water drop. So, these admitted Kells admirers (they even recruited His Trappedness' engineer, Abel Garibaldi, to help produce this disc) should know better than to smother the painfully aimless \"Show and Tell\" and overfed \"Stages\" with undue slops of rhythmic goop. Aside from the creepy, mouthbreathing intro track, nearly every song on Kings lugs on for more than five minutes; in most cases, they hardly contain enough passable ideas to warrant three. Still, the group's indulgences crank just right twice, on the electrobounce of \"It's Just Cruel\" and the Caribbeandream sway of \"Canday's Away\". Kings' slickness is mostly wasted, but works in favor of \"It's Just Cruel\". \"This 45 is better than the things before,\" sing the duo in pointed falsetto, and in this instance, their conflation of Isley Brotherssmooth and Rick Jamesstrut is worthy of comparison to lofty forbears. Whereas elsewhere, lines like \"sweat's gonna getcha/ Your body's hot to measure\" sound stuck somewhere between irony and kitsch, here the Trust convincingly enunciates such slick, primal urges. Likewise, every chime and mouth percussion punctuation of \"Canday's Away\" contributes to its sexedup longing, allowing the mellow melter to wallow in the fatalistic undercurrent of earlyhour lust. Indiefunk is a dangerous proposition. On Kings & Queens, chasing the groove sometimes leads to jammy voids filled with wonky synths and bouts of exercisemachineinfomercial bullshit. But it's also a worthy proposition because, as the glimpses here prove, there are few things more undeniable than a thick, icyhot groove. "}
