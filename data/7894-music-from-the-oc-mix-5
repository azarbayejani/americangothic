Mix 5","text":" Many of us are all too familiar with what it feels like to be a high school nerd whose life is defined by an allegiance to \"underground\" music, and for a brief time in 2003 and early 2004, it seemed like Seth Cohen did, too. During the first season of \"The O.C.\", Adam Brody's character was the kind of guy who threatened to kick his crush out of the car when she complained about the Death Cab for Cutie song on the stereo (\"it's just one guitar and a whole lot of whining\") or recoiled in horror when the popular girl next door said she listened to the Clash. But by the end of the second season, when Death Cab performed at the Bait Shop, \"The O.C.\"'s fictional concert venue, Seth didn't even make it to the show. He had more important things to do. Thank god. Who wants a TV show about the daytoday life of a teenage indie rock nerd? It would be as boring as geometry class. Tonight's episode: Bobby updates his MySpace blog and downloads the leaked Belle and Sebastian album! Next week: Susie spends all of her allowance money on an import copy of the Boy Least Likely To record, only to discover that it's coming out in America in a few months with bonus tracks! Even I wouldn't watch that, and I spent half of ninth grade fighting with my mom because she wouldn't let me go to a Sonic Youth show on a school night. Ever since Seth got a life, \"The O.C.\" has pretty much abandoned any pretensions of exploring music dorkiness, yet the show's powersthatbe still seem to want to maintain a connection to indie rock, despite the fact that it now has about as much to do with music as \"Nanny 911\" does. So they keep pumping out these Music From the O.C. mix CDs, featuring tunes that have played in the background during past episodes. The music on these mixes has always been pleasant, dull, and safe, the kind of stuff that wouldn't cause too much stress on parents. Mix 5 is no different. Imogen Heap's incandescent \"Hide and Seek\", which closes the disc, is the only truly disturbing (and truly moving) song on here, but the only misbehavior it would seem to inspire is an unhealthy obsession with the Vocoder. If I caught my kid blasting Rogue Wave's \"Publish My Love\" or Stars' \"Your ExLover Is Dead\" from behind a closed bedroom door, my biggest concern would be that Junior had been stealing my Paste magazines. Or my NMEs: Brit faves Gorillaz, Kasabian, Kaiser Chiefs, and the Subways, all contribute lukewarm tracks to this latest compilation. I've always gotten the sense that the people in charge of \"The O.C.\"'s playlists are grownup music geeks themselves, gleefully submitting millions of people to whatever has been rocking their stereos recently. That would explain the inclusion of LCD Soundsystem's \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\" on Mix 5. Here's a band seemingly tailormade for (and, arguably, by) rock critics, playing a song about another band that maybe 20 percent of \"The O.C.\"'s audience has heard of, featuring a cowbell solo, and rejoicing in the fact that \"the jocks can't get in the door.\" What an injoke! Likewise, when eternally beautiful and eternally tortured couple Ryan and Marissa turn on the radio to pick \"our song,\" out comes Youth Group's cover of Alphaville's \"Forever Young\", a tune that was not only already used in Napoleon Dynamite, but is also about nuclear war.  Somebody's having a lot of fun with this, but it probably won't be the listener. I can't imagine the songs on Mix 5 soundtracking any teenager's life, indie nerd or not; this stuff is better suited to midlifecrisis sufferers who rely on adultalternative radio to tell them what's hip. But then again, what middleaged person would buy a CD designed to look like a high school yearbook, complete with sappy inscriptions and photos of lockers? Besides, everybody knows that the indie kids don't watch \"The O.C.\" anymore. They watch \"Gilmore Girls\". Now there's a show that needs a box set. "}
