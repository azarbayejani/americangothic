Data 80, a new project from multidimensional Swedish producer HÃ¥kan Lidbo, had a song called \"Love Was Made for Two\" on Force Tracks' excellent Digital Disco compilation. A catchy 80sstyle synthpop song with vocodered vocals and nimble programming, the song nicely held down the sillier end of dancepop spectrum covered by the compilation. But 46 minutes of music in the \"Love Was Made for Two\" style is a bit much, and that's what Data 80's selftitled debut has to offer. One of the problems is that the \"Love Was Made for Two\" template is followed almost exactly on about half the tracks. It's the same vocal processing, same tempo, same basic arrangement, and sometimes (as on \"Baby, I Can Forgive\") damn near the same melody. The overuse of the vocoder is what really gets to me. I have a love/hate relationship with processed vocals at this point. Sometimes vocoders are used in a way that absolutely kills, and sometimes I can't get over how tired they sound. Okay, I get it, it's futuristic pop and you sound like a robot. Just like Kraftwerk did thirty years ago. I follow. The best tracks here offer something different. \"Open Skies\" reminds me a little of Dntel's \"The Dream of Evan and Chan\" in the way it channels the innocence of 80s electropop. Tellingly, it has clean vocals, and while the pitch seems just a bit unsteady a times, the singing sounds as fresh as a spring breeze when heard from inside the chorus of cylons. Also strong and clear is \"Don't Believe Me\" which, with a woman on lead, sounds quite Stereolab, mirroring the sort of electronic elegance they achieved on Emperor Tomato Ketchup. Rounding out the decent stuff, the skeletal instrumental \"The Boy Who Grew Up to Be a Boy\" sounds a bit like Yellow Magic Orchestra, with a nice mixture of thin, dinky sounds and more organic squiggles. Even better is the instrumental I believe is called \"Every Pretty Girl's Dilemma\" (my lack of confidence here comes from the fact that the tracklist on the back of the sleeve doesn't match the one the inside), which features the percussive, popcorny Moog we all fell in love with in the 70s. After that, well... \"Love Was Made For Two\" is still pretty fair, although another listen or two and I might get my fill. All told, Data 80 seems like a mixtape/DJ set sort of project good when sandwiched between other tracks from other artists, good on a 12inch, not so good on a fulllength CD. "}
