Collections of Colonies of Bees and Volcano Choir are among the bands that keep him busy, and here on All Tiny Creatures' debut fulllength he's undertaken the thankless task of finding a group of eight different vocalists to collaborate with the band on certain tracks. Justin Vernon is the closest Wincek gets to finding a constant in his career the pair have teamed up in both the aforementioned bands, and Vernon returns here to add a vocal turn to the standout \"An Iris\". To cement his workaholic stature, Wincek released the latter song and \"Glass Bubbles\" ahead of this record, and both of those tracks are complemented by beautifully packaged mixtapes that feature further unreleased material. It's clear that a great amount of care and attention to detail has been spread all over this record; it's there in the diligent curation of those singers and in the themed cover art by Aaron Draplin. It's also there in the music itself Wincek and fellow guitarist Andrew Fitzpatrick have an intuitive knack for delicately stacking up spidery riffs so they work perfectly in tandem, while drummer Ben Derickson and bassist Matthew Skemp demonstrate a mastery of subtly infectious and understated grooves. Some of the touchstones for this music are clear from the outset; the opening \"Holography\" is driven by the kind of evercycling drumbeat Klaus Dinger made his trademark in Neu!, and the compressed guitar squall is reminiscent of the tones Archer Prewitt lays over the Sea and Cake's best tracks. But the breezy vocal humming and frantic soloing toward the end of the song pitch it in a realm where those influences are infused with an unlikely prog and pop crossover, ultimately positioning it in a space unique to All Tiny Creatures. From that point on, this is music that sucks you in, that creates a realm full of niggling little harmonies and treated sounds so densely layered that they reveal more only with repeat plays. Vernon's vocal isn't even the most alluring part of \"An Iris\" the song finds its weight through a lightness of touch in the guitar melodies and a puzzling loop that sounds like the noise a person emits when someone treads on their toe. That song sets the emotional tone for the record, with most of Harbors bearing a bittersweet ambiance that its vocalists tap into. In some cases, such as Ryan Olcott's hoarse tones on the Playlisted \"Glass Bubbles\", it's those vocals that temper the bouncing guitar lines from shifting the track too far toward ebullience. In others, that crestfallen feeling can be more overtly felt in the instrumentation, such as the chiming guitars on \"Breathing Set\", or the muted electronic passages of \"Valves or Hatches\" and the Enoesque \"Triangle Frog\". It's striking how Harbors manages to form a central aesthetic that's identifiable as All Tiny Creatures but can also fold in a wide array of influences. The whimsical backing vocals on \"Cargo Maps\" are reminiscent of the kind of experimentation Brian Wilson was mapping out for the Beach Boys on tracks like \"Roll Plymouth Rock\", and the stopstart segment of \"Aviation Class\" manages to bridge Wincek's fascination with Warpstyle electronic artists and his leanings toward more traditional forms of shiny guitar pop. The focus starts to slip a little toward the end, with another diversion into ambient drift on \"Reservoirs\" and more \"ahhahh\" vocal passages in \"Tine Feature\". But the rippling guitar and choirlike singing of the closing \"Plankton March\" ties the loose ends together and again showcases this group's gift for sifting bundles of sincerity into song via the disparate elements at their disposal. That sense of focus on making emotionally redolent material, and keeping the overall thrust of the project in view despite having many hands on the tiller, are ultimately what makes Harbors solidify into a satisfyingly cohesive whole.
