While guys like Immortal Technique specialize in mouthfoaming sloganeering, Killer Mike comes across as a smart man with a short fuse. The hulking Atlanta rapper entered the game as Big Boi's bruiser friend, adding muscle to OutKast tracks like \"Snappin' & Trappin'\" and \"The Whole World\". But after a few years in majorlabel limbo and a messy split with Big Boi, Mike emerged as something else: a righteous undergroundrap avenger, a live wire with a moral compass and a sensitive bullshit detector. On the great 2006 spleenvent \"That's Life\", he treated the ineptitude surrounding Hurricane Katrina like it was a personal insult, and he responded accordingly: \"[Bush's] mama said the women oughta feel at home/ Getting raped in the bathroom in the Superdome.\" That one song was a more effective ragetrigger than anything John Goodman roared into his webcam during season one of \"Treme\". But Mike's political fury never quite dominates his rapping; he's just as likely to unleash headslap threats or promise to buy his wife fancy clothes as he is to get emotional about economic inequality. Paradoxically, that gives his political stuff more dimension; he's not a onenote persona; he's a man with a lot of opinions, and he knows how to express them with feeling and style. With every album these days, Mike sounds more and more comfortable with the idea that he's always going to be an underground figure, not a majorleague rap star. On the first track of new album Pl3dge, he addresses the major labels who presumably aren't knocking down his door anyway: \"If they talking major money, we can talk, and that's whattup/ If they ain't talking about that, then I remain indie as fuck.\" A few major stars show up on Pl3dge, but they're guys with their own problems: T.I. and Gucci Mane, unable to stay out of jail, and Young Jeezy, unable to convince his label to release his album. For the most part, Pl3dge sounds like an album built to fly under the radar, a fiery oldschool Southern rap record with no expensivesounding beats and no concessions to any radio station on Earth. The tracks largely come from unknown producers, but they're not thin or pedestrian. Instead, they're rocksolid utilitarian affairs with titanic drum sounds and stormy soul samples. There are a few curveballs, like the bubbling quasieastern No I.D. beat on \"Ready Set Go\", or the dazed Flying Lotus collaboration \"Swimming\". But even with those songs, the record still hangs together beautifully, offering up stylistic wrinkles while mostly sticking to a basic Southern tradrap sound. Lyrically, Mike emits plenty of fury, decrying the police shooting of Oscar Grant and airing out some reservations in Obama: \"We appreciate the way you delegate for Henry Gates/ But what about your people slaving in the fields everyday?\" At one point, he even gets all What's the Matter With Kansas?, blasting white people for voting against their own economic interests, caving to the manipulation of the powerful because they've been convinced they're powerful. Smart stuff, but when it comes time to dish out some lurid streetlevel threats, he delivers: \"Have my Africans eat his face like he's some bush meat.\" As Mike's persona has developed, he's figured out what he's good at. On Pl3dge, he caters directly to the audience he's already built, going so far as to offer sequels to two of his bestloved recent songs, \"That's Life\" and \"God in the Building\". And a remix to \"Ready Set Go\" even gives Mike's audience the feelgood reunion with Big Boi that they've been hoping for. But even at his most consistent, Mike is still capable of surprising, as on the riff from \"That's Life II\", where he talks about Democrats being as bad as Republicans (\"You can disrespect presidents and call 'em socialists/ But Palin and Pelosi both gon' have you broke as shit\"), or Mike's decision to share the spotlight with amazing ranted promos from the titular wrestling legend on \"Ric Flair\". These aren't huge left turns, but they don't have to be. Pl3dge is constructed simply as a sturdy platform for one of rap's fiercest and most incisive voices, and it achieves that goal completely. "}
