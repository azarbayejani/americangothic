{"label":" Hydra Head","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/15495/homepage_large.a03340ee.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"Boris / Torche","title":"Chapter Ahead Being Fake EP","text":" With nearly one year passed between the Japanese release of this EP and Hydra Head's officially releasing it in the U.S., it's safe to assume that folks eagerly awaiting new Torche material have already given \"King Beef\" a few listens. The song, one half of this two track split 10\", is a bit of a disappointment. That could be simply the result of lofty expectations absence makes the heart grow fonder to a point, but answering the silence with something as proforma Torchelike as \"King Beef\" isn't going to satisfy anyone. The one wrinkle this tune offers is in its percussion, which comes with a slightly more industrialsounding bent this time around. Otherwise, \"King Beef\" sounds like the sort of enjoyable yet undistinguished palette cleanser the group would add to an album between the real heavy cuts.Aaron Turner art fans notwithstanding, if there's a reason to spend money (or bandwidth) on this release, it's for Boris' offkilter contribution. Working harder than ever to escape pigeonholing (as admirers of their wideranging Japanese Heavy Rock Hits singles from last year can attest to), \"Luna\" finds the heavy psych stoner whathaveyou group moving between black metal (specifically of the Burzum/Xasthur persuasion) and shoegaze. The song's tinny hardcorespeed drumming takes its cues from the former, while Takeshi's keening vocals sound like the result of his singing along to the new SerenaManeesh album. Meanwhile, the guitars play both sides against each other, frantically keeping pace with the drummer in one moment, then switching gears to offer spacious pingponging twonote patterns while chords arc across the firmament.This backandforth goes on for most of the track's 12minute length, giving both the frenetic and fantastical elements of the song room to breathe, and turning what seems like a conceptual misstep into something much more respectable. There's even a sly nod to their releasemates in the track's coda, a minutelong snippet of sludge that, while not nearly as massive as the sort of tectonic rumble Torche can summon from the depths, does their metal compatriots proud.
