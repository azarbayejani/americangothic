{"label":" K","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/16460/homepage_large.0b12d504.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Eric Grandy","artist":"Chain and the Gang","title":"Music's Not For Everyone","text":" Ian Svenonius has been a talk show host, an essayist, and the frontman for D.C. punk, hardcore, and mod/soul groups Nation of Ulysses, the MakeUp, and Weird War. Add to that résumé a stint earlier this year as the honorary activities director and keynote speaker for a weekendlong, garage rock \"Bruise Cruise\" to the Bahamas. In a Washington City Paper essay about the cruise titled \"A Supposedly Punk Thing I'll Never Do Again\" Svenonius also acted as a sort of selfaware narrative interlocutor, peeking over the fourth wall to ask, \"How's the story going? What's it going to say?\" On Chain and the Gang's debut, Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!, Svenonius played a similar split role, as both performer and critical interrogator of what he might call the entertainmentindustrial complex. Songs like \"Interview With the Chain Gang\" and \"Trash Talk\" spoofed music criticism, while other numbers toyed with broader issues of rock'n'roll and latestage capitalism. So a followup titled Music's Not For Everyone suggests a few possible theses: Do Chain and the Gang long for a bygone era of elitism and cultural gatekeeping? Is it an ironic pronouncement on par with their debut's condemnation of liberty? The band plays it typically close to the vest on the title track. Over a distant, dubby low hum and tambourine, Calvin Johnson intones the titular motto, while Svenonius delivers an archly antipopulist spokenword sermon: \"Everyone likes to switch on the radio/ But they don't get it... I know you wanna share, but don't.\" Other guests include guitarist/organist Brian Weber (Dub Narcotic Sound System), and Tara Jane O'Neil. The best songs here are also often the funniest. \"Not Good Enough (Dub)\" is a singsongy admonition against positive thinking set to tipsy, descending piano chords. \"For Practical Purposes (I Love You)\" is a vaudevillian backandforth between two reluctant lovers, with splashes of surf guitar and an alluring female vocal. The selfaware \"It's a Hard, Hard Job (Keeping Everybody High)\" is a faux spiritual, with Svenonius cast as a slave to showbiz, while \"(I've Got) Privilege\" explains, over rubberbanding bass, organ flares, and sultry background vocals, why he's onstage and you're not. Svenonius is still playing his dual role here, singing pop songs while subtly critiquing their conventions, but increasingly with Chain and the Gang he's laying off the ideology to make room for the grooves. Music may lack the crazy ambition of his previous acts or some of the unexpected goofiness of the Gang's debut, but it's still a modest pleasure and a fine addition to Svenonius' catalog. "}
