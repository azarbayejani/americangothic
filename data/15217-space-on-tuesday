{"label":" self-released","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16321/homepage_large.467dfebc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"Leika","title":"Space on Tuesday","text":" The tinny bassdriven rumblings that open Leika's Space on Tuesday initially suggest they're an act hoping to grab whatever money Franz Ferdinand and other angular postpunk throwbacks left on the table nearly a decade ago. Once the song starts proper, however, this UK quintet brings to mind punks of a different vintage. Their melodically strident vocals are the stuff of every great Buzzcocks single, while the judiciously used (and skillfully deployed) brass section seems to have been pulled straight out of Paul Weller's bag of tricks. The less said about the lyrics the better it'd be hard to sneak a \"silly cow\" rhyme through the middle of a verse, let alone the chorus but as first impressions go, this track isn't half bad. Unfortunately, about half of Space on Tuesday has a different feel. A rule of thumb if you navigate this album: If you hear horns kick off a track, then you're in good hands. The better part of Space on Tuesday features tunes that wholeheartedly explore the R&B/pop vibes that the brass section on \"Silly Cow\" only hints at. Imagine Pete Shelley taking Elvis Costello's Attractions for a Motownstyled spin, and you'll have some idea what \"Indigo Skies\" sounds like. \"Love, Love, Love\" and \"Mary\" go even farther back with their retro homages, while the synthy sparkles and blownout sax action (think \"Dancing in the Dark\" or \"Maneater\") place \"Stay\" squarely in an 80s milieu. The sentiments expressed in these songs might seem simplistic or too straightfaced, but the musicianship brought to bear ably compensates any shortcomings. Unfortunately, the group's other attempts to unabashedly rock out on Space on Tuesday aren't quite as successful. There's a haughty selfimportance that seems to infect Leika whenever they decide to make with any sort of overt rocklike maneuvers. These grand gestures come in two flavors: Either there's  some grave existential injustice that needs to be vaguely addressed, or there's a need to show off the guitarist's chops. As a result, either the music exchanges its energetic and joyous swagger for a numbing stiffness (as on \"Fake Mission to Mars\"), or the need to say big important things via AABB rhyme schemes trumps the need to make a song enjoyable. (The hyperearnest babble on \"Shrunken Heads\" is the main offender there.) And then there is \"Sitting Pretty\", which manages to stick its feet in both of these buckets. During most of Space on Tuesday, the album actually alternates between these two types of songs, as if a shameless funloving Jekyll is forced to ground by a portentously pompous Hyde. I don't doubt that, if given a chance, these folks will find a way to reconcile these two conflicting impulses. However, as Space on Tuesday shows time and again, there's work to do before that can happen. "}
