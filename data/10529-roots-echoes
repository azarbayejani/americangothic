Take the Coral, who emerged in 2002 amid a torrent of UK critical hysteria that suggested any band of 20yearolds who displayed a passing knowledge of the Captain Beefheart catalogue could be instantly lauded as the saviours of music. But as the Coral's increasingly reserved fivealbum catalogue has shown, the flipside of being a band that's wise beyond its years is that that band can sound a little too eager to sound like geezers. For all the spottheinfluence 1960s sources heard on the Coral's selftitled 2002 debut, there was a restless energy and surfeit of genreblurring experimentation that liberated the material from being a mere retro exercise; even when they veered toward pastoral folk for 2003's Magic and Medicine, there was a disquieting Wicker Man aura that lent the more serene material a sinister edge. But Roots & Echoes feels locked on an AMradio dial in 1966, when soul music and paisley pop rotated alongside one another without incident. With his early gruffness buffed away, vocalist James Skelly has settled into a comfort zone somewhere between Love and The La's just call him Arthur Lee Mavers his lyrical concerns now entirely consumed by matters of romance and regret. And that shouldn't come as a surprise given that the Coral's most enduring songs (\"Dreaming of You\", \"Don't Think You're the First\") are some of their most candid, and the melancholic, bongotapped breakup ballad \"Not So Lonely\" counts as another worthy addition to this canon. But in Roots & Echoes' more pedestrian turns, Skelly's sentimentality often feels devoid of passionate intent: \"Put the Sun Back\" is a Sundayafternoon stroll of a song in which nothing particularly eventful occurs, and while \"Jacqueline\" boasts a beautiful jangly melody line, the tossedoff chorus (\"Oh Jacqueline/ I know\") feels anticlimactic. Even opening single \"Who's Gonna Find Me\", which surges forth with controlled bursts of acidwashed guitar, feels lacking, as its foreboding bridge sets you up for a chorus that doesn't really elevate the song above its standard Motown stomp. Sadly, Roots & Echoes' air of studious refinement sullies even its more cerebral material with schmaltzy gestures; \"Fireflies\" is a subScott Walker mood piece whose title lyric is punctuated by garishly grooooovy organ fluttering, and slowgalloping closer \"Music at Night\" veers perilously close to Dire Straits dadrock. So in this context, the midalbum raveup \"In the Rain\" feels all the more urgent and vital, a doubletimed northernsoul jaunt that's given an eerie undercurrent by its incessant, spidery guitar line; the fiery, interstellaroverdriven finale of \"She's Got a Reason\" also provides some toolittle/toolate psychrock salvation. But when you've got a young man of 27 already singing wistfully about the \"cobwebs of my mind,\" it's clear you're dealing with a band consumed by the belief that old age is wasted on the elderly. "}
