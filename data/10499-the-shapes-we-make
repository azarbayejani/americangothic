{"label":" Kill Rock Stars","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/10305/homepage_large.8b02824f.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"The Mary Timony Band","title":"The Shapes We Make","text":" To put it succinctly, Mary Timony hooking up with drummer Devin Ocampo has given her music a beneficial kick in the ass, if only because she's never worked with a drummer that would kick it. While Helium's music grew in leaps and bounds between Timony's early chunky chugging and the morepronounced medieval flourishes on the group's last album, it's safe to say Shawn Devlin's methodical drumming wasn't setting any BPM records. Going it alone the first two times, Timony was more likely to use a clavinet, harpsichord, or drum machine than an honesttogoodness drumkit (which was a shame for Christina Files, the sporadicallyused drummer on those two albums). In contrast, 2005's Ex Hex, Timony's first collaboration with Ocampo, featured a rocklike substance Helium fans knew and loved, but with an added boost of nitrous. His fluid polyrhythmic flourishes meshed nicely with Timony's newfound guitar heroism see, all that RenFaire noodling you whiners bitched about did some good for her after all! and the album itself turned out to be a pleasant synthesis of Timony's careertodate. This time around, Timony and Ocampo are joined by Ocampo's Medications bandmate Chad Molter on bass, and are rightfully calling themselves The Mary Timony Band Timony's still the one driving the car, of course, but the other two are paying for their fair share of gasoline. It's their gentle pitterpatter that keeps \"Pink Clouds'\" talk about pink clouds from evaporating, and they're definitely no slouch when it comes to rocking out (\"Curious Minds\" and the appropriately titled \"Rockman\" be proof). On one track \"Pause / Off\" the trio even manages to pull off a fair impersonation of SleaterKinney, with Timony vocally channeling her former Spells cohort Carrie Brownstein as she laconically zings lamestains \"hanging out in the CVS parking lot\" and \"Supreme Court misters\" trying to mess around \"with me and my sisters.\" Refreshing lyrical moments like those noted above are few and far between, unfortunately. The woman whose incisive words once crosspollinated grrlish gender politics with alluring imagery ripped straight out of Kristin Hersh's songbook is now alternating hippiedippy musings on nature's endless bounty (clouds, trees, bunnies, etc.) with lazy gonowhere couplets like \"We can't go back/ It's a natural fact.\" Timony tries to shoot off more oneliners in the semitopical spirit of \"Pause / Off,\" but they don't work as well \"Ted Nugent, hey, what you gonna do?/ What you gonna do when they come for you?/ White tails gonna hunt you down/ Do unto you as they've been done.\" But whatever lack of effort seems evident in the words, the music more than makes up for it. Just before the WTF Nuge shoutout in \"Sharpshooter,\" there's a riproaring bridge that displays the band's ample strengths. It's not the only example \"Rockman\" eventually lives up to its name when Timony stops going on about the dude the song's supposedly about, and the winsome waltz in \"Window\" (decorated with pretty strings and piano twinklings) works best when Timony's voice gets subsumed by the song's gentle melody. It's a shame she's doesn't seem to be saying much of anything nowadays, but as long as she has music this strong doing the talking for her, Mary Timony will do just fine. "}
