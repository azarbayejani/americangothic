No, seriously. Tear your ceremonial American Apparel sackcloth, dirty with your salontussled hair with sacrificial ashes, and thank Jehovah for almost a decade of Stones Throw goodness. I mean, who else would release a comp of late 1970s/early 1980s Connecticut hiphop? Since PB Wolf (aka Chris Manak) dropped his opening salvo with thendeceased best friend Charizma in 1996, Stones Throw has been hiphop's avatar, preserving all the merriness of a South Bronx block party and the dedication of a sleepyeyed cratedigger. Since then, Stones Throw has burgeoned into funk reissue kingpins and the home of some of the finest, most original hiphop on either coast. To christen their 100th release a limited edition white vinyl EP PB Wolf and his decks birthed a 42track mixtape covering the breadth of the label's work. Needless to say, covering a label's entire collection is difficult especially considering the Stones Throw roster epitomizes idiosyncrasy. But Wolf's track selection is impeccable as he knits a seamless mix from a truly colorful yarn. (Besides, you can't go wrong when Madlib produces 70% of the tracks.) Charizma appropriately opens the retrospective with an Oliver Twist intro, an allusion to ST's dusty beginnings: \"In the bboy stance, I'm in the smog all alone/ When I didn't have a mic, I rapped with headphones.\" From there, ST 101 turns \"SportsCenter\": all highlights. From Yesterday's New Quintet's sonorous, lighthearted \"Young Girl\" to J. Rocc's cavernous breaks on \"Play This One\", PB Wolf dances through the ST catatlog, including a handful of oftforgotten tracks from his funk subsidiary, NowAgain Records. Couldn't get enough of Hoagy Carmichael's fuzzy arrangements for Boston jazzmen Stark Reality? Lost your copy of Constitution State producer DooleyO's 1990 12\" \"Watch My Moves\"? Just can't bring yourself to buy from a group called Funkaho? The gang's all here. And, of course, the unreleased and material is onpoint. Jaylib's foggy \"Blaze Up\" introduces a J. Dilla cum Max Headroom, swimming in a vocoded abyss. Meanwhile, on Madvillian's \"Figaro\", Doom's braggadocio marries the Bollywood cuisine of Madlib's mysterious Beat #222. If the mix CD doesn't clearly illustrate the Stones Throw sound, the accompanying DVD fills any gaps. From Madvillain's dazzling Stan Lee cartoon freeforall on \"All Caps\" to the choreographed breakin' and poppin' on Breakestra's fiery \"Getcho Soul Together\", the videos provide a freespirited alternative to music video's status quo. Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf's \"Red Light, Green Light\" is a hilariously dated collage of home video and live performance with the duo's headbobbing antics from 1993. Jaylib's burlesque \"McNasty Filth\" is the only commercial fare but, don't worry, the girls \"volunteered\" to be in the video. (Way to be, kids.) The bonus features are the weakest part of the collection. While amateur video of Egon interviewing Lester Abrams of the obscure Omaha funk octet L.A. Carnival may hold personal value for the ST staff, the segment comes off like an inside joke. Moreover, the footage of Jaylib's first performance in London is poor and far too short. It's nice to see DooleyO rock the mic again, but most of the bonus section seems unnecessary. Fortunately, the rest of the set is nearly flawless. "}
