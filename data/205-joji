It's here that the Anomoanon's Joji seems destined to be found, burrowed out from the wet earth, caked in clay, beloved by ants. There's something unsettlingly familiar about Joji, the Anomoanon's seventh fulllength it might be because the sixpiece resuscitates and revises a variety of classic rock gestures, or because their sound is so oddly, eerily organic, or because vocalist/guitarist Ned Oldham's high, throaty, Kentuckyborn warble can sound disconcertingly similar to younger brother Will's. But mostly, it's how Joji sounds like aboveground pools and paper cups full of lemonade, like fireflies in mayonnaise jars and rusty sprinklers, country cottages and snap peas: it's Americana without the prepackaged kitsch all ground and sky and precious American ritual. Joji sounds like a record made by mountains. For the most part, Joji eschews the light, snappy melodies and traditional lyrics of its predecessor, The Derby Ram, in favor of woodsy, instantly addictive countryfolk dirges. Given Oldham and guitarist Aram Stith's fondness for scrappy electric solos, it's not particularly surprising that the Anomoanon are routinely compared to On the Beachera Neil Young and/or the Grateful Dead circa American Beauty but keyboardist Dave Heumann's psychinfused squiggles lend Joji a dark, celestial swagger that's more Floydian than anything else (see, especially, mesmerizing opener \"Down and Brown\"). Joji has its share of folkier moments, too the instrumental \"After Than Before\" features 12string noodling, puttering bass, and minimal percussion, while the plucky, Stithpenned \"Green Sea\" is singalongready, anchored around a honky guitar melody, sixman harmonizing, and Oldham's shrugging vocals (\"Your socks and shoes are filled with sand/ Your heart is beating for another man\").Joji confidently follows its own ebbs and flows, and, consequently, can occasionally feel a bit jammy but before you conjure drum circles, handmade pants, and Birkenstock clogs, know that the Anomoanon are always, always purposeful about their wankery, and some of the extended instrumentation included here (see the excellent \"Wedding Song\", which flits, over the course of its 10 staggering minutes, from waltz to 4/4 and back to waltz) is genuinely impressive. Joji may periodically flirt with gothic undertones, but it ultimately plays like a warm, comforting slice of deep American rock recognizable and exciting all at once. "}
