{"label":" Universal","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/6799/homepage_large.8a16d2ac.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Hartley Goldstein","artist":"Raekwon","title":"The Lex Diamond Story","text":" After 1999's lackluster Immobilarity, Raekwon's third and latest fulllength has a lot of making up to do. However, the lack of name producers (one of the record's contributors disparagingly calls himself Crummie Beats) and the absence of RZA from the album credits seemingly dooms The Lex Diamond Story to mediocrity from the start. Good news, though: Raekwon thankfully swerves around the R&B; flavored synthhop of his last outing here and, surprisingly, stumbles onto his own proverbial Stillmatic, a rather selfconscious and haphazardly successful attempt at recreating the sprawling criminologyladen glory of his landmark 1995 debut, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. The album fittingly opens with a lackluster intro that tears a page from the RZA handbook to laughable effect: As a rainstorm pours in the background, we're treated to the poorly recited \"legend\" of Lex Diamond (Raek's illadvised sometime alias here). Fortunately, the rolling, percussive barrage of \"Pit Bull Fights\" quickly kicks in, and Rae shocks the world with a classically inspired verse. The nostalgic album highlight \"All Over Again\" fares even better: Over a Kanye Westderived production of chipmunksoul vocals, choppy percussion, and gushing strings from newcomer Mercury, Raekwon reminisces of his early days with The Wu: \"The Clan were one of the greatest/ We did platinum back in '93/ We was living who y'all trying to be/ RZA had a vision/ Instead of cooking coke in the kitchen/ He told the god hit the booth and start spittin'.\" Furthermore, on \"Missing Watch\", Raekwon and Ghostface recreate the classic chemistry they shared on much of Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. Even conceptually the track is brilliant; what could be more suited for a unselfconsciously ostentatious guy like Ghostface, the kind of guy who actually walks around wearing a gigantic goldplated hawk on his arm, than a song about losing your watch that \"costs about a mansion\" while out in a club? Over a wailing electric guitars, Rae and Ghost frantically jar, \"DJ turn the fucking music off/ We got announcers we want ya/ To listen clear/ We just lost about a mansion in here/ If we don't get it back it's gonna be a problem/ Ain't nobody leaving alive until we find it!\" Unfortunately, those are just about the only highlights within this glut of pseudocommercial, RZAlite sonics. \"Ice Cream Pt. 2\" features forgettable cameos from Method Man and Cappadonna, and an instrumental so unnecessarily syrupy that I was worried any minute Mariah Carey might break out on the track's hook; it's so awful, I even had to remind myself I enjoyed the original. \"Robbery\" is a shameful posse cut, where Ice Water Inc. (Raekwon's new crew) spits inspired rhymes like, \"'Cause like the bomb, I'm waiting to blow up.\" \"Planet of the Apes\" is another bout of patriarchal insecuritydriven blather, where guests Capone and Sheek Louch run threats like, \"Me and chef spark massive murder/ Killings, I scramble anywhere,\" and \"The Hood\" is built on the same clich√©d piano melody that EZElpee made famous over a decade ago (at least they decided to give Isaac Hayes' wildly oversampled \"Walk on By\" a rest). In trying to recreate the energy of his earlier work, Raekwon's made The Lex Diamond Story a considerably better listen than its hapless predecessor, but its lack of creativity and innovation ultimately doom it to irrelevance: Who'd rather listen to this than Cuban Linx?
