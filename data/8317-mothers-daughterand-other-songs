{"label":" Static Caravan","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/8180/homepage_large.0448dbec.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jason Crock","artist":"Tunng","title":"Mother's Daughter...and Other Songs","text":" \"Folktronica\" is an unfortunate and probably outdated verbiage, but it's still apt for Tunng's debut album, Mother's Daughter...and Other Songs. The title and opening track begins with an unaccompanied female voice singing one note. Her voice is then inhumanly manipulated over stark percussion and a few staccato acoustic chords and, eventually, transformed into more traditional guitarbased folk with harmonies from Tunng's two main players, Mike Lindsay and Sam Genders. While I'm charmed by the reference to the discoverers of DNA in the love song \"Code Breakers\" and vaguely creeped out by The Wicker Man vibe in \"Fair Doreen\", the record continually falls into the same patterns straightforward folk with brief diversions, rustic samples or electronic percussion. \"People Folk\" is a more accessible Beta Bandlike lurch, with sparse, pounding drums; \"Out the Window With the Widow\" is even more bare a few banjo plucks underneath Lomaxian echo, with electronic snaps and the hippie chanting of Lindsay and Genders. \"Beautiful and Light\" brings a more concrete melody plucked from acoustic guitar, along with a tender, memorable vocal line. A few faroff bell chimes tug the heartstrings a little harder, and the echo on the vocals and train engine samples add nostalgia while the skittering beat retains the urgency. It's impossible not to cite the Books after hearing this album's squishy, affectedly ancient percussion, not to mention the circular rhythm and vocal samples in \"Kinky Vans\". Artists like the Books or, say, the Junior Boys fully embrace dance/electric instead of merely spicing up their songs with a hint of otherness, and they don't flinch at leaving verse/chorus/verse behind. That's where Tunng falls short (or, in the case of \"People Folk\" or \"Kinky Vans\", just sound derivative). But am I reticent with praise because I need to put Tunng in a genre or a label? Or is it that Tunng aren't even trying to reach the bar they've set for themselves? Let's not knock simple folk songs, because Tunng have some great ones; \"Beautiful and Light\" even gains something from the production methods. But adding a few samples here and there doesn't deserve accolades in and of itself, and updating the timeworn with the cutting edge merits more than just a few pretty tracks. "}
