Deusner","artist":"Lucinda Williams","title":"Live @ the Fillmore","text":" For better or worse, Lucinda Williams has spent the past couple of years living down Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. On Essence and especially World Without Tears, she replaced the Southern storytelling, travelogue nature, and plainspoken poetry of her breakthrough with an increasingly confessional tone and a decreasingly friendly voice. Her disposition has never been exactly sunny and her voice has always been a little gauzy, but she's grown defiantly prickly; as she obsessed over a broken relationship, wondering how it could cause as much happiness as pain, her songs have become more emotionally explicit, her voice more boozily abrasive. \"Ghosts in the wind that blow through my life/ Follow me wherever I go,\" she sings on \"Bus to Baton Rouge\", \"I'll never be free from these chains inside/Hidden deep down in my soul.\" This trend toward extreme introversion crystallizes with Live @ the Fillmore, recorded over two nights in San Francisco. While the double live album is a timehonored tradition, Williams makes it immediately clear that this isn't going to be Double Live Gonzo! or Frampton Comes Alive! The first disk begins not with the requisite upbeat showstarter (although this version of \"Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings\" would have been perfect both sonically and thematically), but with a slow ballad three of them, in fact. Obviously, this is not the Lucinda Williams of the Car Wheels on a Gravel Road tour (chronicled on a New West Records DVD, released concurrently). The 22 songs on these two disks are culled mainly from Essence and World Without Tears, with only a few from Car Wheels, Sweet Old World, and Lucinda Williams (and none from her first two albums). Instead of leading us through the South of \"Crescent City\" and \"Jacksonville\", Williams takes us first out to California on \"Ventura\", one of only three geographically defined songs on the set (\"Pineola\" and \"Bus to Baton Rouge\" being the others). Almost compulsively Williams airs her sins and misgivings on songs like \"Fruits of My Labor\", \"Three Days\", and \"Are You Down\", sounding both gushing and guarded. But her vocals, even on talkingblues songs like \"Sweet Side\" and \"Righteously\", reveal a woman living through all the messy frustration and unalleviated desire she's singing about. After a deliberately slow start, Live @ the Fillmore picks up considerably toward the end of the first disk. Williams spits venom on \"Changed the Locks\" and \"Atonement\", while her backing band, especially guitarist Doug Pettibone, generates ferocious barblues rock. The second disk reverses that trajectory, starting hard and fast but ending soft. The barreling momentum of \"I Lost It\" and \"Joy\" gradually gives way to the sexual/narcotic fervor of \"Essence\", the low simmer of \"Are You Down\", and the faltering disappointment of \"American Dreams\", which sounds even more like diluted Springsteen in this setting. The old Lucinda of Car Wheels reappears briefly on the final two tracks (both of which, ironically, postdate that album). She's there in the detailed memories and interior drama of \"Bus to Baton Rouge\" as well as in the delicate vibrato of \"Words Fell\". Both tracks are a little more hopeful than the equally gentle ones that begin this set, suggesting Williams has managed to exorcise some of those ghosts blowing through her life. "}
