Fine, so they never reconfirmed ABBA national stereotypes with more defiantly bubblegum brilliance like 1995's Life or 1996's First Band from the Moon. They just needed their space. Maybe they got it on 1998's electronicatinged Gran Turismo, but they're not the ones who didn't call after the dulcet poprock slickness of 2004's melancholic Long Before Daylight. \"True love is cruel love,\" formerly blond frontwoman Nina Persson sang on that album's brutal \"And Then You Kissed Me\". Turning toward jagged countryrock, sixth album Super Extra Gravity strips the bandages from a 10year abusive relationship that hasn't been this pokerhot since the early days. It's a reason to keep coming back. Believe it or not, cruelty was always an undercurrent for the Swedish quintet, formed in 1992 over a love of heavy metal and a hardcore past. Selfdestruction is the order on first single \"I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer\", as a sultry Persson describes lovers' quarrels that lead straight to \"a glass or 10.\" Yo La Tengo guitar squalls intermittently rend smoldering breakup song \"Losing a Friend\". A seductive sadomasochism further informs stomping \"Drip Drop Teardop\" and dark finale \"And Then You Kissed Me II\", which extends its predecessor toward an ironical \"happy end\". On soaring countrywaltz \"Overload\", with Spectorreverbed honkytonk pianos, the pain gives way to even fierier pleasures: \"I'm hot, baby/ Don't burn your fingers.\" Religion soon intrudes on the sex, as is its wont. \"Godspell\" recalls Emmylou Harris in condemning all manner of crooks who brandish the Lord as a crutch, but mostly it seethes with hotblooded guitar and gently accusatory piano. Its whistling midsong march is just one of many surprises in the album's carefully constructed compositions see also the newwave synth following the straightahead \"Dreams\"era Fleetwood Mac verses of \"In the Round\". Steeped in organs, \"Holy Love\" lifts toward an angelic bridge on the strength of bursting bass and what sounds like harpsichord, but ultimately finds love as conflictfilled as ever. \"I can even be nothing if you ask/ I'll turn invisible for you,\" Persson pleads huskily. Despite some gratingly obvious rhymes, \"Good Morning Joan\" is a catchy, faster number even as it rejects any semblance of salvation.Super Extra Gravity is too deft to be too dark, though there's joy in its catharsis. \"Sit...good dog!\" begins \"Fine Wine\", as guitar, bass and drums bark in conversation. \"Little Black Cloud\" just wants to dance, and second single \"Don't Blame Your Daughter (Diamonds)\" is a ballad as VH1ready as anything on Cat Power's recent soccermom stab The Greatest, only prettier. These days it seems like every new band is Swedish. But my original Scandinavian love, armed with a newly raw aesthetic, has finally approached the beauty of that longago MTV first sight. Hit me baby, one more time. "}
