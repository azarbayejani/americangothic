The band made that stylistic shift houseward just in time to give the likes of Hot Chip and Simian Mobile Disco a headsup on where nurave came from. For a while, though, there was still one thing that separated the Rapture from the dancerock acolytes that cropped up in their wake: a stylistic mission statement thinly disguised as a mix CD.Tapes changes that, but to what effect? It's one thing to throw a bunch of songs together and show everyone what kind of cool stuff you've been spinning lately especially if it's a potential harbinger of what kind of ingredients might be going into a forthcoming album. And there's enough to get the modern clubmusic eclectic a bit geeked just looking over the tracklist: classic rollerboogie funk from the BarKays and Vaughan Mason, vintage and revival disco, and a whole fistful of acts that hit all kinds of different points on the continuum between house and electro. It's a fine blend of the obvious (Paul Johnson's massive 1999 house hit \"Get Get Down\"; Ghostface Killah's perennial \"Daytona 500\"), the obscure (Richie Havens' discofied take on Lamont Dozier's \"Going Back to My Roots\"; Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band's campy bigband homage to Irving Berlin's \"I'm an Indian Too\") and the current (Syclops' agitated retroDetroit electro \"Where's Jason's K\" and DJ Mujava's house jam \"Township Funk\").Still, there's a difference between being a tastemaker with a great record collection and being a straightup momentumbuilding DJ, and if you value slow builds and subtle transitions you might find yourself getting a bit antsy. The first half of Tapes is thrown together in a slapdash manner that leaves grooves too restless and transitions too jarring: The intro is 32 amputated seconds of the Undisputed Truth's \"Earthquake Shake\" cut abruptly into \"Daytona 500\", and the Ghostface track's attempted mix into the Junkyard Band's antiReagan classic \"The Word\" from a straightforward funkfusion break into the tumbling, rolling syncopation of the archetypal gogo beat feels like taking an Aston Martin offroad. And that aforementioned rollerboogie twofer of \"Holy Ghost\" and \"Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll\" should work, but the inexplicable halfassed fade into $20boombox tinniness at the end of the BarKays track just before the segue isn't the smoothest way to move into couples' skate.Fortunately, not all of the mix is as jarring Martin Circus' 1979 Francocheese \"Disco Circus\" shakes hands well with Arcade Lover's sleek nuChic \"Fantasy Lines\" and if you aren't too bothered by the seams, you'll eventually find that the second half of Tapes is packed tight with great recent tracks. Along with the Syclops and DJ Mujava cuts, there's Kiloo & Phonique's icyhot deep house \"The Passion\", the Donk Boys' rubberkneed \"Cpstyre\", and the roomfilling ghettotechelectro of Dances With White Girls' \"Everybody's Got to Make a Living\", which boasts a kidneypunch level of bass and makes great use of the vocal hook from the 20th Century Steel Band's \"Heaven & Hell Is on Earth\". This mix might not help the Rapture pass every test of the best club DJs, but when it comes to maybe the most important one the ability to make clubbers push their way to the booth and breathlessly ask for the title of that amazing cut they just dropped they've done their studying.
