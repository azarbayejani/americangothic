{"label":" Atlantic / Goldmind","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/2736/homepage_large.b8231ed5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ryan Dombal","artist":"Missy Elliott","title":"The Cookbook","text":" For all of the unswerving worship heaped at the altar of Timbaland, his last collaboration with Missy Elliott, 2003's strangeforthesake This Is Not a Test!, was the sound of a oncegreat tagteam rehashing their own tricks with diminishing returns. Yet, for such a tightknit pair, it's long been a question how she might fare without his input. On The Cookbook, we're given our answer. Here, Timbaland has gone largely absent, and while it's refreshing to hear Elliott easily one of the most innovative and engaging artists to have graced hiphop's microphone again imbued with purpose and something to prove, the duo's impossibly high standards and norules originality are sorely missed on some of the record's sleepier, more conventional tracks. Like an untethered spouse suddenly separated from a longtime love, Elliott seems a bit lost somewhere between her intimidating past and her newfound independence. Even more bipolar than usual, The Cookbook finds the rapper/singer jolting from uberhypeness to soulcrushing balladry. Fortunately, supported by an array of producers both grizzly and green, her invaluable unpredictability is alternately harnessed and given new life on this album, despite its uneven and transitional nature. Elliott eases into the transition, opening the album with Timbaland's only two productions. After a remarkably unnecessary intro track featuring guest vocals from Mike Jones, the platinum club's least charismatic new star, Timbo slides in with \"Joy\", a wispy thump that would sound a lot more radical and stealthy if the Ying Yang Twins had never learned to speak softly about big sticks. Jones returns at the end of the track to (you guessed it) say his name repeatedly and spout off his cell number, quickly turning a onceclever selfpromotion routine into a particularly shameless homeshopping network ploy. This is followed by the generic \"Partytime\", which finds Elliott sticking it to defenseless hasbeens like Coolio and Sisqo (was Kris Kross too obvious?). Of course, never one to kill in a lyrical showdown, Elliott compensates for such limitations with a gumchewing sass that's virtually unparalleled. A vocal chameleon, she's the rare artist who can score as both a sultry r&b; crooner and a hotshit rhyme slapper. Showing off the latter persona, Elliott crushes on the Rich Harrison burner \"Can't Stop\". His tribal drums and blastoff horns should sound exhausted after \"Crazy in Love\" and \"1 Thing\", but they still manage to provide Missy with a spectacular foundation on which she unleashes a flurry of typically blunt sex raps. Likewise, destructive subbass and cartoonish bendymetal boosts help to make \"On & On\" the Neptunes' most inventive track since \"Drop It Like Its Hot\", on which Pharrell pulls off a strikingly authentic Slick Rick impression. This, however, is after the real Rick puts in a cameo on the halfrap, halfr&b; throwback \"Irresistible Delicious\". Continuing Under Construction's oldschool archival tendencies, \"Irresistible\" doesn't just feature the legendary eyepatched taletwister; it also heavily samples his awesome \"Lick the Balls\". It's further proof that, despite her insistence that her \"style can't be duplicated or recycled,\" Elliott isn't afraid to rehash others' material including the timeless \"Apache\" on \"We Run This\", and Mary J. Blige's \"What's the 411?\" beat on \"My Struggles\". In fact, she often flirts with both reverence and unoriginality to a disconcerting degree. \"Irresistible\" ducks such criticism with its beautifully lush, if oddly tackedon chorus, which offers the album's most appetizing singingMissy moment, but other slowjams fail miserably: The Scott Storchproduced \"Meltdown\" makes Carrie Underwood's drippy \"Inside Your Heaven\" sound like a genredefining new classic, while American Idol Fantasia Barrino just sounds like a sober Macy Gray on \"4 My Man\". Finisher \"Bad Man\" enticingly sees Elliott looking to the future of bodybending beats with an electropalpitating bounce that wouldn't sound out of place on Arular. Fittingly, M.I.A. and Vybz Cartel drop by for guest shots, and Maya's hungry sneer pushes Missy to new raggatinged heights. The song makes a convincing case for Elliott to take another stab at creating a backtofront Timboless record more suitable to her nearpeerless pedigree. "}
