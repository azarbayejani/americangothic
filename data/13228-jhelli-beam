On \"Least Favorite Rapper\", guest Nocando spits, \"The suburban kids say I'm not street enough/ But compared to them, I'm street as fuck.\" It's that combination of selfawareness, selfdeprecation, and, ultimately, selfdefense that's played a large role in defining the Busdriver Experience over nearly a decade of wayleftofthedial hiphop. Though too bizarro for mainstream acceptance, it actually works in his favor; as much as Busdriver appeals to the technically obsessed purists, he might even hold as much appeal for people who'd otherwise avoid hiphop completely.Still nothing's gonna stop Busdriver from critiquing just about everybody outside of the Project Blowed collective an aim that makes Jhelli Beam  feels at times less than laserguided. \"Least Favorite Rapper\" initially sounds like it's got a serious case of the Paul Barmans check the bloodcurdling opener: \"These sneaker geek MCs to me are so Brokeback/ So fuck sexy, in '09 I'm bringing broke back.\" But the reason it actually ends up being funny (Nocando is \"vibing witcha like Michael Richards\" before letting off a Tommygun blast of the word that ended his career) lies in how it sounds like it's actually parodying indie rappers complaining about strawmen (\"He sells more drugs than the FDA/ He's ready for war like FDR\") than making an actual critique of the mainstream rap scene. At least I hope that's what it is: These guys do realize the Next Great Hope (as of June 2009) of hiphop played a wheelchairbound high school kid on a Canadian sitcom, right?As always, Busdriver is about as technically impressive as an MC can get, the cultural vocabulary of DOOM funneled through Doseone's vocal dexterity (though as a singer, Bus is far more unhinged). Hey, I love both of those guys, but there's a reason you don't hear too many people thinking they should borrow from each other. I can think of a handful of times where I can hardly believe that this stuff can be listened to for enjoyment Bus plays cat and mouse with Mozart's \"Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major\" on lead single \"MeTime\" with stunning agility, and while it's admittedly the kind of thing you'd like to see him pull of live, I can't so much vouch for him appropriating Carl the Groundskeeper's gopher song from \"Caddyshack\" (\"Handfuls of Sky\") or \"This Old Man\" for a tribute to Project Blowed loyalty (\"I've Always Known\").\"Art rap!\" he declares at the beginning of \"World Agape\", as if you couldn't tell from the erratic jazztom rolls that comprise its two and a half minutes. But it's tough to tell just how much Busdriver's in on the joke the very first words of Jhelli Beam  are \"conscious rap failed us,\" and later on, he sneers \"underground rap happened 10 years ago\" before admitting that people in his position get \"no kudos for being a pseudocommie\" despite functioning \"under the awning of [his] moral high ground.\" Thanks to typically clubevasive but inventive beatmaking from longtime associates Nobody, Daedalus, and Nosaj Thing meshing wonderfully with Busdriver's torrential flow, Jhelli Beam  somehow can be enjoyable just as an inoneearouttheother experience; you can enjoy the claphappy cadence of \"Manchuria\" or \"Quebec And Back\"'s goblinlike vocal effects completely worry free.But once you get yourself involved, there's no turning back you just brave the storm of proper nouns and pop culture detritus to the point where it's a Girl Talkstyle game of \"oh, hey I recognize that!\" but not a GirlTalkstyle listen for, well, pleasure. The question then become whether you can maintain interest in how much effort Busdriver exerts to get across... god knows what. It takes a couple of pushes on the rewind button to cobble together how \"Dane Cook table reads\" and \"anal beads\" can constitute a rhyme, let alone \"bouillon cubes,\" \"oolong tea,\" and \"Moveon.org.\" Why should I call him \"Scoliosis Jones\"?Taken in context with just about everything else, it's another reference to Busdriver willing to let his freak flag fly, but since when was clarity such anathema? Particularly in a situation where the heads that Bus seeks out are equally into a rap classic that boasted, \"I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin'\" as they are into the \"spiced out Calvin Coolidge/ Loungin' with seven duelers\" classic. In the end, yes, Jhelli Beam  manages to be a completely cerebral experience and at times overwhelming in a satisfactory way, but then again, you could say the same about ice cream headaches. "}
