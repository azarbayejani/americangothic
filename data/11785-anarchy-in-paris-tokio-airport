{"label":" Acute","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/5562/homepage_large.ca633548.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"Metal Urbain","title":"Anarchy In Paris!","text":" Anarchy In Paris! is a 24track oversight correction, a collection of recordings from \"criminally neglected\" French punkera group Metal Urbain, or so the liner notes would want you to believe: \"[O]ne would think that [Metal Urbain]'s groundbreaking drummachine assault, shouted vocals (in French what's more!), distorted crashandburn guitars, metronomic noise clicks, and their claim to fame as the first act to release a record on Rough Trade would guarantee them some hallowed place in Punk Rock history.\" Indeed, the groups mentioned as sonic antecedents of Urbain's music most notably the Jesus & Mary Chain and Big Black make the oftabused claim of wrongful neglect justifiable in this instance. And then you realize what probably kept Metal Urbain from getting the same reverential treatment of their hallowed peers or their recentlyexhumed brethren are probably the very things that attracted folks like the Reid Bros. & Steve Albini to their work: Their groundbreaking (as in pulverizing) drummachine assault, their distorted crashandburn guitars, the metronomic noise clicks, and their shouted vocals (in French, as the group didn't set up enough obstacles between themselves and any potential Englishspeaking fans).Listening to Anarchy In Paris! in short bursts, the couldabeenacontender gnashing is intermittently justified. \"Panik\" (the Aside to the aforementioned Rough Trade single) constructs a primitive and monstrous wall of fuzz, and pelts the wall with a drum machine, some synth splatter, and cavernous martial barks. Even if the nuance of the message is lost in translation, the backandforth shouts of \"Panik!\" coupled with the incendiary guitar solo at the halfway mark make clear the group's intent. Unfortunately, most of the remaining 23 tracks feature minor variations and refinements on this Wall Of Industrialized Sound, turning the bulk of this album into indistinguishable mush.While some wrinkles in the formula emerge \"Pop Poubelle\" features some surfguitar, \"Lady Coca Cola\" is Metal Urbain sans drums they're blanded out after the TommyRamonatron is triggered and the vocalist gets the bit removed from his mouth. It takes until Track 19, the Kentuckyfried \"Colt 45\", for some real variety to spice up Metal Urbain's cuisine, and that's mostly courtesy of a minor tweak in guitar tone and a singing style that shies away from the usual Cookie Monsterisms. The next track, \"Train\", is even more of a screwball it's blues standard \"Train Kept ARollin'\" done with drum machine and guitar. The trick here is that the drum machine keeps perfect time after all, it is a machine while the guitar and vocals decide to derail themselves every so often. The friction between the oblivious drum track and the stumbling meat turns out to be charming. Following that there are two slabs of mechanized heavy breathing (\"Sweet Marilyn\" and \"Little Girl of Love\"), a tangonottango, and an instrumental reprise of \"Panik\" that takes a Sunday drive on Gary Numan's Autobahn, but chances are most folk will get bogged down by the murky middle section of this disc and never get to the goodies at the end.For those looking for a little more variation in their neglected French newwave retrospectives, try Tokio Airport, a 19track Metal Boys compendium. The Metal Boys features two parts Metal Urbain (Eric Débris and Charlie Hurbier) and one part Englishspeaking Nico clone (China). It's on these tracks that Anarchy In Paris!' flights of fancy soar. For one, the group's learned how to program their drum machine to do more than play poomtish at different speeds, which allows for excursions into bossanova (\"He's Shaken Up\") and stray cat strutting (\"Parlez Moi D'Argent\"), in addition to the expected scifi damage. Also, China proves to be a flexible vocalist. She's willing to do the pop robot on bip boppy tracks like \"Be Bop Dee Zee Pop\", \"Wah Lee Bomp Dee Bomp\", and the less onomatopoetic \"Discount Bill\", but China's equally at home playing such disparate roles as the Strangelovian porn star (in \"Suspenders in the Park\" feel free to quote either \"Fuck my ass in World War III\" or \"Napalm, you're so good in bed\" in your valedictorian speech) and the semidetached quotidian raconteur (in the oddly affecting \"XMas Day\").Of course, since the Metal Urbain disc ended on a high note, the Metal Boys disc backs into the finish line, ending with 21 minutes of dubby warbling (\"Un Petit Peu D'Amour\"), repetitive oscillations (\"Disco Future\"), and some unseemly middle ground between these two poles (\"Outer Space\"). But, then, these discs are meant to be historical documents, not succinct statements of intent. As such, they might not guarantee Metal Urbain a notable place in music history, but it's not as if Metal Urbain is ready for carbondating just yet, either. Twentyfour years after breaking up, they've reunited, and are in the process of recording a new album while simultaneously looking for a label to release this record. Plus ça change, plus c'est la meme chose. "}
