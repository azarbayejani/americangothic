{"label":" Capitol","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/5589/homepage_large.4c83e628.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Rachel Khong","artist":"Marjorie Fair","title":"Self Help Serenade","text":" The best lyrics off Self Help Serenade cover sex in folding chairs (\"We gave her half a million shares/ To sleep with her boss in a folding chair\"), and the worst are typical dramaqueen bellyaches: Girls are \"death and beauty at the same time\" and \"Daylight is not the same/ When you're stabbing at the stars in your eyes/ And bleeding is what you see.\" The weakest part of Marjorie Fair's Nickelbackcopycat act is that singer Evan Slamka doesn't understand that even downtrodden chamber pop can still be part deux of \"How You Remind Me\". He makes the mistake of handing us a heart worth breaking (i.e., his own, sad sucker): Glossy angst this oblivious errs regrettably on the side of selfindulgence while it's probably more naivet√© than hubris, it's still unpardonable. Observe Slamka, born and raised in New Jersey, calling L.A.'s Skid Row \"very fastpaced, with lots of drugrelated issues,\" and articulating that his shortlived residency has taught him \"more about the human condition.\" Big names Jon Brion, Billy Preston, Jerry Finn, Rob Schaff assist him in communicating \"feelings deep inside,\" but that's no recipe for surefire success: Marjorie Fair's shiny Beach BoysmeetsPernice Brothers act suffers primarily from wellintentioned overproduction. Deceptively lovely arrangements are, in all likelihood, responsible for the UK release's resounding handclappery, but overlook lush, dreamy, and toodeliberate arrangements, and there's little else that points to greatness. Self Help Serenade ends up like the Thrills' So Much For the City: Its vision, however elaborately constructed, is monotone to a fault. The album's merits lie mainly with upbeat departures from humdrum tempos. \"Empty Room\" and \"Waves\" are standout tracks catchy gems to otherwise lugubrious melodies. \"Please Don't\" would be Self Help's \"Butterfly\" (softspoken, repentant) if the album in question were Pinkerton only problem is, it's not: Where Weezer's loserrock once excelled by sharing these sentiments, there's no tension on Self Help no restraint or release, just weepy nitpicking. Ballads threaten to impress but wind up sluggish and repetitive. \"My Sun Is Setting Over Her Magic\" is the band's best example of the graceful restraint but it should be more concise and its sentiment more simply expressed: \"My heart is sinking under the weight/ Of things so clear I can hardly tell/ If it's you or if it's me\" has nothing on \"Don't talk/ Put your head on my shoulder.\" It might be heartless to fault Slamka from goodintentioned extremes caring too much and trying too hard but please: The road to lyrical hell is paved with them, and bad poetry is still bad poetry. Heartfelt or not, Self Help Serenade could stand to undergo revision. Slamka is the sort of writer who doubles as mother; he loves all of his children, though he'd do better to drown three of five kittens. Next time around, Marjorie Fair should subdue cheap heartstring tugs quit upping production, start killing off proverbial kittens. "}
