Then, in a surprising turn, his career was revived by attention from the experimental rock underground. Jim O'Rourke, Glenn Jones, David Grubbs, Thurston Moore, and others championed Fahey to an audience mostly born after his 1960s heyday. It was a fortuitous development not only because it rekindled interest in Fahey's catalogue, but because his own interest in experimental music happened to be on the upswing again at that moment. Disciples like O'Rourke and Jones were the perfect catalysts to nudge him toward further exploring that side of his work. The result was a string of albums that explored ambience, collage, and drone while also incorporating Fahey's signature guitar playing. The best is 1997's Womblife, which leads off this twodisc compilation of the three albums he released on Atlanta label Table of the Elements. Together, these records offer a fascinating snapshot of this point in his career. In retrospect, Fahey was at a crossroads here between the far edges of soundart that he was drifting towards and the fingerpicking tradition he would revisit in the final years of his life. After performing at Table of the Elements' Yttrium festival in Chicago in November of 1996, Fahey spent a week recording Womblife in O'Rourke's bedroom. O'Rourke was on a roll as a producer and collaborator, having fashioned the intriguing Faust collage Rien the year before, and his influence here is clear. As he and Kevin Drumm (his roommate at the time) added touches of dissonance and rumbling backgrounds, Fahey crafted haunting pieces more concerned with atmosphere than structure, unleashing clouds of tones that echo, overlap, and reproduce.  On \"Sharks\", Fahey treads through deliberate chords that melt into cavernous sonics, reverberating like the metallic drone of O'Rourke's own hurdygurdy piece Happy Days. \"Eels\" places similarly cautious strums inside an even darker sonic envelope, while \"Planaria\" juxtaposes Fahey's most plaintive playing with looped recordings of Balinese gamelan music. As the chiming repetitions intertwine with Fahey's uniquely warped slide work, an unlikely midpoint between Steve Reich's phase minimalism and Charley Patton's backwoods blues is struck. Womblife concludes with the simple, beautiful \"Juana\", a piece that reemerged in 1998 on Georgia Stomps, Atlanta Struts, and Other Contemporary Dance Favorites, included here on the second disc. Recorded in Atlanta in August of 1997, it's Fahey's first and only live electric guitar album. His flow is mindbending as he weaves improvisation, curved takes on classics like Artie Shaw's \"Nightmare\" and Duke Ellington's \"Mood Indigo\", and sly interpretations of his own pieces into one restless guitar marathon.  There's no denying Fahey's creative prowess here, but his impulsive discourse is impeded a bit by the shrill tone of his borrowed guitar. As Fahey scholar Byron Coley put it in a Perfect Sound Forever essay, \"Friends of mine have reported being physically sickened by the depth of electric effects that Fahey utilizes.\" Indeed, at least one track, \"Song for Sara\", requires reams of patience due to its high, piercing tones but brace yourself through multiple listens and you might find that the album's severity fades.  Appended after Womblife on disc one is Hard Time Empty Bottle Blues, a 10minute set of acoustic guitar taken from the Chicago festival performance that preceded Fahey's sessions with O'Rourke. Previously released in 2003 as a onesided clearvinyl 12inch, the record is a bit of an afterthought compared to the other material here. But in its own small way, it's perfect, filled with the kind of labyrinthine figures, ringing tones, and deft shifts that mark Fahey's best work. It's this precise fingerpicking sound that he would soon return to, just before his passing in 2001.  The nimble playing on those four tracks makes the excursions on Womblife even more impressive. David Fricke's liner notes suggest that Fahey had lost some of his playing ability by this point, and perhaps that was true, but Hard Time Empty Bottle Blues shows he could still tear off dazzling runs that most mortals would envy, suggesting that Womblife's experiments were less inventions of necessity than bold creative choices. Fahey refused to abandon his fickle muse even this late in life, making Sea Changes and Coelacanths a vital curve in the winding path left by his staggering oeuvre.  "}
