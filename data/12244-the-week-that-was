But for fraternal Field Music leaders David and Peter Brewis, the end of the band does not mean the death of the brand. Citing a growing disillusion with the touring and promotional aspects of being in a band but a continued enthusiasm for the recording/creative process, the brothers have essentially split into two outfits united under the \"Field Music Productions\" banner: David was first past the post earlier this year with his boisterous new School of Language project, which closely adhered to its antecedent's postpunky guitar pop schematic, while Peter now emerges with the even more ambitious The Week That Was, whose assured selftitled debut ushers in the Brewis brothers' next phase in earnest. Perhaps Field Music's most impressive quality was how they pulled off complex, multiinstrumental arrangements in a threepiece format; The Week That Was makes those grandiose intimations real with a formidable ninepiece lineup (including David in a supporting bassist role). Opener \"Learn to Learn\" begins with a booming repeated bassdrum/floortom pattern that acknowledges the lingering influence of XTC (cf., \"Making Plans for Nigel\"), but also serves as a telling harbinger of Peter's renewed aesthetic, in which traditional newwave guitars and synths are deemphasized to exploit the acoustic and percussive qualities of pianos, vibraphones, marimbas, cornets, violins, and, yes, cowbells. It’s an approach that was prefigured by Tones of Town tracks like \"A House Is Not a Home\", but given a more authoritative treatment here: the ticktock clatter of \"The Good Life\" and the hypnotic, Congotronic vibraphone oscillations of the gorgeous \"It's All Gone Quiet\" prove to be perfect complements to their workaday narratives, while the stuttering, tripyouup drum beat of \"The Airport Line\" makes the journey to its swooning chorus that much more rewarding. When the strings come in to soothe the staccato rhythm, the net effect is something like Big Star's Third/Sister Lovers as performed by Can. Despite the more elaborate presentation, The Week That Was sticks to the Field Music tradition of packing a surfeit of ideas into a compact package, in this case eight songs and 32 minutes; even the inclusion of a sevenminute proglike suite, \"Yesterday's Paper\", doesn't curb momentum, those omnipresent drum rolls propelling the song through its multisectional turns at a brisk clip. Peter’s songwriting sensibility places him squarely in a postpsych/postpunk tradition that's equal parts Colin Newman and Carl Newman, Robert Wyatt, and Robert Pollard, but the constant tension between The Week That Was' percussive and melodic elements means that, unlike Field Music, his new band can’t be so easily aligned with contemporary indierock acts peddling newwave nostalgia. Never mind the retrogazing moniker The Week That Was is a band you need to hear now. "}
