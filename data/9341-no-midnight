The medium that may one day be more immediate than whatever medium Pitchfork didn't replace has christened a new band deserving of our appreciation and concern. And that new band is...a jangly Everclear? Die, stagnant rock radio, die, finally, at the hands of the people! Yeesh. My ears feel like they've been listening to 10 notdiffuseenough acts, all of them requisitely \"indie\" and marinated with just enough Springsteen to seem congealed. Almost every whiterock sound since the mid1980s is on display here, and energetically, too. Peter Arcuni's agreeableemo voice wants to be loved so much that you will feel like a total condom if you don't hop on board their website that only sells girls' tees and the typoseasoned, teenrhetoric bandblog. (Google image search these dollcakes for maximum cuteness.) Listen to Arcuni's (literally) heartfelt inhaling! He means those clich√©s! Check that manly chirrup when he doublemeans them! I stopped keeping a curmudgeonly list of them after the one about the hand in the cookie jar and the one about at night while the city sleeps and the one about lend me your ear and the one about wanting what was in the store window and the one about you can have it all. Only a petty deskbound wanker would be embarrassed for Arcuni, right? Joy Division and Radiohead and Blue Sky Studios certainly don't own the phrase \"ice age,\" but Birdmonster settles for treating it like a Jimmy Buffett version of the apocalypse on \"Ice Age\". Which leads to another problem: For a band whose singer is constantly acting like he is freaking out about some intense something or other, Birdmonster's debut fulllength hosts a disproportionate number of songs about how everything's going to be okay or alright. In a recent The New York Times column, Aaron Britt argued that \"alright,\" in the context of rock, meant \"sublime\" and not just \"mediocre.\" Birdmonster's \"alright\" seems like the latter. They kick in precisely when a kickin is due, and they break it down at a tooappropriate breakdown interval, and they speak bodymovement commands to the danceclub crowd as if they're recording in an expansive, soldout bedroom. And hey ladies, the \"thing named Rita\" stuff, and the stuff about saving a \"darling\" from \"the dark side of life,\" just reeks of Candlebox's heroic chest hair. Concession: The dual guitar play between Arcuni and David Klein is unimpeachably graceful and thunderous, even on the derivative dancepunk (ahem, discorock) outings. Only the unpredictable Buddy Holly moves on the finale \"Spaceman\" hint that this band has higher goals than to appear on a future compilation called Obnoxiously Earnest Careerists, alongside Rock Kills Kid and OK Go.
