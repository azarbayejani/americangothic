I've seen the list, and I can promise that you hipsters won't be disappointed... unless you dig Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam, Hall & Oates and Shalamar. Rejected by the purveyors of taste and abandoned by the Top 40 radio that fostered them, these brave artists made the kind of bubblegum R&B; and pop that was, after its brief moment in the sun, destined for landfills. Fortunately (I guess), Beat Junkie and turntablist extraordinaire Rhettmatic have been digging through our collective trash to collect a mixtape that fuses turntablism gymnastics with the dopest beats from the worst songs ever. Yet, while there are no doubt countless mix tapes surfacing of 80s songs mined for their camp appeal, Rhettmatic takes a different route; for The Wedding Mixer, he actually puts these songs in a context that brings out their accidental genius. Klymaxx's \"Meeting in the Ladies Room\" may be the hottest song ever about getting laid in the bathroom. And KC & The Sunshine Band's \"I Get Lifted\" may be the best song ever, period. I wanted to kiss Rhettmatic for mixing Hall & Oates' \"I Can't Go for That\" into Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\", a song that has faired far better than its creator. Rhettmatic even drops some great oldskool hiphop classics like Rodney and Joe Cooley's \"Supercuts\" and \"Looking for the Perfect Beat\" by Afrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force. In fact, my only complaint with the disc's selection is with what may be its best song: James Brown's \"Get on the Good Foot\". While there's no denying its status as a classic and massively influential track, it feels out of place here not only because it isn't from the 1980s, but because it is a recognized classic. Why not throw in some New Edition or Giorgio Moroder? Of course, Rhettmatic slices and dices his material so that the breaks are accentuated, and his work on Evelyn \"Champagne\" King's \"Love Comes Down\" is particularly hot. And although nothing mindblowing, Rhettmatic's scratches on this disc are very nice and add a certain hiphop flavor to the proceedings, even when laid over Yaz's \"Situation\", perhaps the whitest song ever made. Despite the skills on display, though, the purpose of this album is to reclaim the music that we felt embarrassed to have ever listened to. Sure, this album may be a novelty, but if nothing else, it's at least a really good one. "}
