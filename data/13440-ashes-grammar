Ashes Grammar, the sophomore album from Philadelphia septet A Sunny Day in Glasgow, doesn't sound composed with modern tools overdubs ad infinitum but like pop music masterfully puzzled together. Featuring bushels of tracks that blur the line between interlude and song, many listeners will associate the twodozenstrong tracklist with either unfinished business or lazy editing, but Ashes Grammar is a surprisingly disciplined affair. Watch the band tunnel a small groove during \"Evil, With Evil, Against Evil\", drop it, and pick it back up again before moving quickly on. They mine the ringing, orbital electronics of \"Canalfish\" for 90 gorgeous seconds before letting it slip into \"Loudly\"'s more concrete whoosh. \"Passionate Introverts\", however, needs its fourplus minutes of glowing pulse to deliver its serpentine melodies and abstracted nostalgia (\"Do you believe in dinosaurs at all?\", asks the chorus), and SDIG provide it the necessary breathing room. Summed, the shifting tracks pull Ashes Grammar through its hourlong runtime smoothly and patiently. Ashes Grammar is more propulsive than SDIG's debut, Scribble Mural Comic Journal, whose effectsheavy compositions sometimes felt leaden or overconsidered. \"Blood White\" and \"Loudly\" thrum along with Krautrocky beats. Those rhythms, when mixed with SDIG's litepsych jams, recall Caribou's The Milk of Human Kindness or Múm's whipped electrofolk. The band plays with contrast, often layering their catchiest and most concrete vocals (\"Passionate Introverts [Dinosaurs]\", \"Failure\") over their least tidy, farflung compositions, while their most traditionally orchestrated moments (\"The White Witch\", \"Close Chorus\") receive affected cooing and wordless harmonizing. If there's a real complaint to be lobbed at Ashes Grammar it's that the vocals are too often buried, and their mushmouthy Liz Frasertimbres too willingly blended into the pooled sonics. If SDIG didn't imbue so much of Ashes Grammar with a terse rhythmic presence, many of these songs would easily be swept into the ether. Ashes Grammar is not for those who need their pop music spitshined and robust. Instead, SDIG form their hooks stealthily, letting acoustic guitars and a steady patter rise from the ambient beginnings of \"Starting at a Disadvantage\" or repeating phrases amidst the disparate stretches of \"Nitetime Rainbows\". \"Close Chorus\" offers big, breaking hooks only after four minutes of morning chatter. Ashes Grammar draws you in by offering outstanding moments in strange contexts; you'll relisten to hear specific pieces even though you're unable to remember exactly when and how they occur. Ashes Grammar often feels like the result of a band who took Martha Reeves & the Vandellas' \"Come and Get These Memories\" in the most abstract, artdamaged way possible: nostalgic, jigsaw pop music from a group of writers strong enough to keep you humming and courageous enough to make you guess.
