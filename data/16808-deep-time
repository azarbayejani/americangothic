{"label":" Hardly Art","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/17969/homepage_large.beb858d8.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Lindsay Zoladz","artist":"Deep Time","title":"Deep Time","text":" Austin duo Deep Time's music is Liliputian in every sense of the word. For one, guitarist/vocalist Jennifer Moore's prickly, palmmuted chord progressions and occasional yelps conjure the jaunty postpunk of Delta 5 or Swiss artpunk pioneers Kleenex/LiLiPUT. In another way, there's a general sense of smallness about this music it feels simple, compact, restrained. But Moore and drummer Adam Jones do minimalism so well that it's this very smallness that makes them stand head and shoulders above plenty of lessdistinct postpunk revivalists. Deep Time go against the current indie grain of smoke machine atmospherics and stadiumsized dreams in favor of something much more streamlined. The nine songs on their selftitled album are welldesigned contraptions, as simple, madcap, and proudly anachronistic as Rube Goldberg machines. The subject matter of their selftitled debut as Yellow Fever (they changed their name after one of those lawsuits that makes you wonder if there are actually any band names left) occasionally felt small to a fault. The tunes were as catchy and amiable as an early Beat Happening record, but Yellow Fever weren't exactly plumbing deep thematic waters. Singsongy and sweet, songs like \"Cutest\" played out like nursery rhymes for scene kids: \"My brother and me went to a show/ And we saw everyone we know.\" But Yellow Fever never drowned in their own tweeness; instead they captured something about the sense of belonging that comes from living in a small town where everybody's on a first name basis (\"Donald\", \"Alice\", and \"Donovan\" played out like odes to the people next door). Its homey charms played on a simple, timeless premise: Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. Much of what makes Deep Time feel like such an undeniable step forward, though, is the darkness that's crept into these songs: You no longer get the sense that they're taking place in Pleasantville. \"Coleman\" paints an unsavory domestic scene of \"dirty sinks and sandy food,\" so no wonder Moore sings of the central character, \"You never go home.\" Deep Time is preoccupied with all sorts of shadowy feelings loneliness, disillusionment, and homelessness and its militant lockstep beats; cartoonspooky organ riffs; and bristly, dissonant chords mirror this vibe. A few of the narrativebased songs here are still named for characters (\"Sgt. Sierra\", \"Gilligan\") but this time they're far from home, and the neighbors aren't exactly bending over backward to keep the search party going. \"The gas is gone and the plane is out of control,\" Moore howls on the eerie \"Bermuda Triangle\". \"Are you sure they're searching still?\" Moore's voice is versatile (pivoting between a low drawl and a canine howl on the slithering earworm \"Sgt. Sierra\"), expressive, and distinctly cool. There's occasionally some black comedy in her phrasing (the way she breaks up \"I'm sleeping with the/ Fish\" gives the lyric an unexpected punchline, and a pretty dark one at that), or some emotional resonance in the smallest details (\"I'm leaving home and I want you to know/ I'm leaving home and I want you to no...tice\"). Every detail on Deep Time feels deliberate, which makes it more arresting than plenty of records that make a lot more noise. There's power in pauses, silence, and empty space, these songs affirm, and small doesn't have to mean slight. "}
