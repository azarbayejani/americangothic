{"label":" Anticon","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/15159/homepage_large.847a737d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Dosh","title":"Tommy","text":" The grimy percussion that kicks off \"Subtractions\" the opening track to Dosh's fifth solo fulllength, Tommy may shock those familiar with the producer's work. Dosh's previous records had a tendency to open with a sort of tonal discretion, allowing the listener some sapce before working themselves into jazzimbued grooves. Tommy, however, begins in the middle, and as such, \"Subtractions\" sounds as if someone had flipped the \"record\" switch during a jam session without letting anyone know that tape was rolling. That restlessly energizing sound bleeds right into \"Yer Face\", with vaportrailed drum fills and snatches of coos surrounding a rare, sighing vocal turn by Dosh himself. Together, these tunes are arguably more potent than anything Dosh has recorded throughout his career. An album filled with tracks like these would be a real treat.Unfortunately, Tommy is not that album. Much of the record named after and dedicated to late soundman and friend Tom Cesario finds Dosh working comfortably within his folktronica wheelhouse. Maybe too comfortably, in fact: it's very easy to let this record pass right by you without noticing it's there. The issue isn't a consistent mood, though: there are takes on IDM (\"Country Road X\"), hiphop (\"Airlift\"), and bummedout folk (\"Nevermet\") here. However, none of these genres are tackled with anything more than a mannered intention, as Dosh treats the material with fussiness. What it really needs is a shot of spontaneity. Album low point \"Number 41\", featuring Andrew Bird, is especially staid, with a drowsy vocal turn by Bird that makes even the most boring of his own material seem effervescent by comarpsion.Regardless, Tommy's strongest moments the elegiac piano on the ironicallynamed \"Loud\" or the hollow boombap of \"Airlift\" sound fully realized and complete, suggesting that Dosh's best work is still yet to come. When Dosh stretches his legs on the album's longer compositions, the results are especially compelling: a honking saxophone riff turns \"Call the Kettle\" into a woozy carnival ride, while the acoustic postrock textures of eightminuteplus closer \"Gare de Lyon\" rip open to reveal a brawny guitar figure and supercharged cymbal hits. Dosh has indeed graduated from the sketchbooklike arrangements that marked his earlier work but Tommy's occasional tedium is a reminder that there's nothing wrong with doodling in the margins, either.
