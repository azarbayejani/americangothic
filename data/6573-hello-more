{"label":" Dirigeable","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/6477/homepage_large.66c88a1c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Plane","title":"Hello More","text":" If the indie rock single wasn't such a constitutionally impoverished creature, Plane might've released a great one. Instead, the Chicagobased quintet felt the need to make a statement, and after the initial cochleatease of \"Western Avenue\" and \"Heart & Soul\", Hello More spends 20some precious minutes emphasizing to the listener that the band's imagination is too eclectic for catchyass electro pop alone. I'm seeing \"Western Avenue\" as the Aside. The schmaltzy drum machine that limps all over the record works better than elsewhere in this melodic, structured context: Muted guitar chords chomp rhythmically at the splashy mechanical beat like small teeth, and Ed Anderson's cool falsetto coasts through a foursquare, Gibbardesque melody (yeah, I said it). The crisp dynamic shifts and organized flourishes whet your appetite for more of the same, especially during the radiant synth pinwheels of the chorus. The variegated beats, lush guitar pulses, cleanly shifting intensities, and svelte vocals of \"Heart & Soul\" further elevate these high hopes. It's especially frustrating that the two winners are sequenced right at the beginning of the album (after the brief overture \"Compass Tape\"), so that they trick you into thinking you're in for a consistent experience. Not so; the remainder of the record is wildly erratic in every aspect, even recording quality, and it sounds more like defensive experimentation than deliberate variation. It's like taking a couple bites of a tasty peanut butter and jelly sandwich, only to find subsequent bites getting all avantgarde with ham, then onions, then sardines, then Legos. If a dynamite single wasn't enough, they even could have stretched it to a solid EP. On \"Rope\", Edgar Legzdins replaces Anderson's bright, silky falsetto with a drearier register, but it's a passable bit of sillyrobot motorik homage. The straightforward emoting, acoustic strummage and injured guitar leads of the title track are nice enough; and even \"Please Save My Body From the Modern World\", with its goofy drum patterns, spongy bass throb and feelgood rock vocal could've worked on an EP, as a tackedon \"Hey look at this wacky thing we made on the fly haha we're crazy dudes\" song.  But all this excellence and decency is occluded by stillborn fragments that seem a slap in the face to Plane's songwriting chops. \"Party Train\" is among the most interesting of these, tremoloed guitars wending through a rhythmic chassis of German vocal samples and jerky drums. \"It's What I Like, Dear\" and \"Adams\" both sound like partial demos of uninspired indie rock songs, and \"Broken Woods\" is a lowcarb Animal Collective substitute. I guess Plane made whatever statement they needed to make, but from a listener's perspective, Hello More could've stood to be a bit hello less. "}
