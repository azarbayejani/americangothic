{"label":" Atlantic","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15706/homepage_large.daa20729.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Chromeo","title":"Business Casual","text":" Business Casual, Chromeo's third fulllength, cements them as true scholars of squelchy chart pop. It's as if they spent three years inhaling the entire repertoire of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis before putting that knowledge to action. The record is their first on Atlantic, and they've put that major label money to good use: This sounds expensive and studiofinessed, a facet no doubt aided by Cassius member Philipe Zdar's mixing skills. The depth of production here is quite literal; when there's space to breathe on these tracks, it feels like a cavernous expanse rather than dead air. Their previous work had big aspirations, but this record cements their potential as a marquee band.More money means more studio time, and more studio time can lead to more experimentation; as such, Business Casual's most successful moments are the result of genrerelated legstretching. \"Don't Walk Away\" captures the symphonic grandiosity of sidelong disco edits in under four minutes, syrupy strings and all. Elsewhere, the record's showstopping midsection \"Night by Night\", \"Don't Turn the Lights On\", and \"You Make it Rough\" dives deep into icy, moonlit electro sounds, the latter taking a sevenminute journey from the heart to the stars. If that description brings to mind Junior Boys, it's because at their best, Chromeo are doing something not too dissimilar in function: synthesizing a wide range of erudite musical signifiers into something more tangibly direct and pop.The duo succeed at constructing sumptuous backdrops on this record, almost to a fault. Despite its richly detailed excesses, Business Casual nonetheless feels slighter than Chromeo's previous efforts due to a relative lack of hooks. Opener \"Hot Mess\" oscillates tediously, with nearridiculous spoken word interjections. The Solange Knowles collaboration \"When the Night Falls\" is a missed opportunity, as Solange is reduced to wailing the illfitting chorus while Dave 1 turns in a weak, barely murmured vocal performance. If you want a softrock update of Billy Joel's \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", see album closer \"Grow Up\" (but don't say we didn't warn you).Granted, Business Casual comes close to superseding previous LP Fancy Footwork in two ways: \"J'ai Claqué La Porte\" combines the seemingly nowtoken \"sparse song\" and \"French song\" into one to minimize filler, and there's not a single song here that's named \"Tenderoni\" (ugh). Otherwise, the record is a unique situation, as it represents Chromeo's growth as master arrangers and producers, despite feeling like a step backwards in overall quality. "}
