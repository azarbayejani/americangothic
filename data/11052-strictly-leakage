{"label":" Rhymesayers","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/10835/homepage_large.1c33dbc8.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Atmosphere","title":"Strictly Leakage","text":"  We ain't having any of this \"emo rap\" business, all right? Sean Daley chases and/or is driven out of his mind by the ladies, but even when he gets unhinged and broken up he usually doesn't come across as that much more selfindulgent than the Pharcyde on \"Passin' Me By\". And when he does, it's a lot more Hi Records than Victory Records, the wounded latenight laments of a chainsmoking vet who's experienced enough to shoulder at least some of the blame in his bad situations. Whatever the case, that whole rep too often winds up overshadowing Slug's other strengths, ones less easily overshadowed on his actual records: His selfaware but celebratory partyrocking; his taste for battlerap aggression; his reverence for hiphop history, even if he's not always reverent about his potential place in it. Strictly Leakage is the ideal record to show all those qualities off, and the fact that Atmosphere put it up on their website for the bargain price of zero dollars and zero cents means that the costreward ratio alone is enough to recommend it. It's a great gift to fans and a fine complement to the three Sad Clown EPs (Bad Summer, Bad Fall and Bad Winter) he's dropped over the last six months not really a collection of castoffs and Bside candidates, but a nice outofnowhere minialbum with its own continuousmix backbone. And for those who're jaded enough by torrents and filesharing to not really care about the notion of a free fulllength album and are unconvinced that Atmosphere's worth their bandwidth, they might want to know that Slug's rarely sounded more charismatically confident. As party/tour/live show stories go, Slug tends to keep things somewhere between familiar and specific, like the escapism and halfmocking camaraderie of the club scene that \"Full Moon\" references (\"we all paid dues, we all workin' hard/some fools even had to pay a service charge\"), or the brief but highvelocity gambling references in \"What They Sitting For?\" which could go either way as brags of prowess with poker or rocking stage. There's also a couple funny stressfree ladies' man jams, peaking with \"Domestic Dog\", where he realizes the bar scene is too problemati and he decides to get his mack on at the grocery store instead (\"actually, I would like a free sample,\" he exclaims between verses). And it's always novel to hear his smartassed cackling sneer put up against a handful of other MCs in a posse cut, which is where \"Crewed Up\" comes in: not only do Rhymesayers favorites Brother Ali and Blueprint get their shots at delivering their customary highgrade fuckyouup battle verses, but a few of the Twin Cities' less nationally known MCs  Stage One, St. Paul Slim, Muja Messiah and Toki Wright tear it up, and even YZ (as in the underappreciated, deepcratedigger favorite, Sons of the Father YZ) shows up to bring a hot verse. Much of the force and appeal behind Slug's voice can be partially credited to the way it's augmented by Ant's production, which skews sampleheavy and, at least here, close to the funkandsouloriginated tradition of late 1980s and early 90s beats. There's a few nods to the golden age of hip hop: \"YGM\" rides the same Albert King loop as Big Daddy Kane's \"Young, Gifted and Black\" (or, as Slug spits, \"young, gifted and mixed\" maybe now he'll stop showing up on all those \"favorite white MCs\" messageboard threads), and \"Road to Riches\" is a halfremixed take on the Kool G Rap classic. Ant's production, per usual, works by sticking to what he does best, taking classic sources the Meters, James Brown and his funky People, the Stax roster and making them bump so hard and so clean that '88fetishizing stasis isn't even part of the equation.  Even if Strictly Leakage is more partycentered than his regular releases, it's still a bit reflective and philosophical, though it doesn't get too moody about it. The closest Strictly Leakage gets to fatalism is the tongueincheek addiction anthem \"The Things That Hate Us\", a rundown of hazardous indulgences from menthols, fast food and \"suicide Big Gulps\" to unprotected sex and hard drugs (\"This is for the needles you shared/ 'Cause them afterschool TV specials is too square\"); it plays like a Denis Leary bit with all the selfrighteous kidsthesedays bile replaced by a somewhat embarrassed hindsight guilt: \"America the beautiful, that's how she played us/she wasn't that cute, it must've been her makeup\". Even when he gets booed from a voice the crowd in \"You Played Yourself\", he gets pissed off at the security for kicking the heckler out and later refunds him after the show with the nohardfeelings admonishment \"I understand, dude, I was just like you when I was 15.\" And the first verse of \"Little Math You\" is one of the bravest things any indie rapper's said about identity in a long time: it starts out like a typical rant against suburban white teens who listen to rap \"Oh, they don't know no nothin' about no hiphopâ€¦look at 'em! Little suburban thugs!\" pulls off a slick baitandswitch by giving the kid credit for finding something he can express himself through, then rolls his eyes at the selfappointed enforcers of rap \"realness\": \"You tellin' me that this ain't for him, right/how many y'all motherfuckers get an invite?\" Shit, if Atmosphere is \"emo rap,\" it only stands to be pointed out that sticking up for those who don't quite have it all figured out yet is an emotional response, too.
