If the previous sentence makes the new album sound like it's a carbon copy of its predecessor, then you see what I'm getting at. Vanderslice reportedly wrote most of the album while trying to resolve some visa issues concerning his French girlfriend entering the U.S. The album's concluding track, \"Central Booking\", is the one song that directly addresses this issue, though its concluding thesis \"looks like September won once again\" hangs over the entire album. As with Pixel Revolt, nearly half of the tracks make mention of, or allude to, the World Trade Center attacks, while the rest of the songs are awash in the debris and carnage from the tragedy and its aftermath. Even the album's title is a pointed reference, the \"Emerald City\" being a derogatory nickname for the \"Green Zone\" in downtown Baghdad. However, while Vanderslice's observations and commentary sounded fresh and fierce two years ago, the same essential message run through similarly sounding songs this time around rings hollow. Musically, Vanderslice is on top of his game, deftly walking the line between tasteful and ostentatious, but even his skill in this regard can't soften the heavyhanded rhetoric. The queasy acoustic guitars on \"Kookaburra\" lend the song (which details the apocalyptic power of \"lightning shot from the sky\", a recurring theme) an unsettling air, while the lilting piano figure of \"The Parade\" sets a happy scene for what turns out to be another ironically bittersweet paean to the collapse of the towers (never mind an awful case of synthesizer flatulence in the bridge). Throughout the album, Vanderslice chooses to use amplified acoustic guitars, similar to what you'd hear on Spoon albums. They lend the more aggressive tracks (like \"Time to Go\" and \"White Dove\") a percussive propulsion, but these gains are undercut by the lyrics' lack of oomph.  In the past, Vanderslice could infuse both his fictional and nonfictional songs with a convincing emotional heft. This time around, he's as eloquent as he's ever been, refining and strengthening his shortstory songwriting style. However, the constant referral to \"lighting from the sky\" and towers and drones flying by becomes as cloying and ineffective as the multiple references to 9/11 utilized by political hopefuls and pundits. Only on the album's concluding track does Vanderslice snap out of his insightful ennui and involve the listeners in what he's saying. The brief verses of \"Central Booking\" concerning the plight of his girlfriend and him being separated by distance and bureaucratic red tape ring truer than the purporetedly heady rush of imagery concerning a woman's dead daughter (\"White Dove\") or a Cindy Sheehanesque war protester (\"Tablespoon of Codeine\"). The worst offender is \"Time to Go\", the portentous story of a wagontrain trying desperately to cross the country (\"Burn the wagon wheels for heat\").  Even on a shortandsweet track like \"Numbered Lithograph\" a song that sounds an awful lot like something his last album's coconspirator, the Mountain Goats' John Darnielle, would put to tape there's something missing. The idiosyncratic references that would ground the lyric sound forced, and the more immediate details (\"Your cellphone shuddered and blinked/ It was your boyfriend again\") don't resonate. Maybe the album falls short because of what Vanderslice claims at the end of \"The Minaret\": \"I can see both sides, and it paralyzed me.\"  "}
