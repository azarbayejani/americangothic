{"label":" DMC","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/7487/homepage_large.016b8e0d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Super Furry Animals","title":"Under the Influence","text":" The Super Furry Animals inhabit a world apart. They've recorded some of the most excitingly innovative British pop of the past decade, and yet their sound is also instantly familiar: heir to the Beach Boys' endless California summers and the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tourera psychedelia, prone to Orbitallike electronica eruptions, and as musically omnivorous as David Bowie. The 'Fork archives are littered with encomia to these Welshmen's greatness. As we suspected all along, their influences sound mighty nice, too. The Super Furries' installment in DMC's Under the Influence series previously curated by the likes of Morrissey, Paul Weller, and Ian Brown reflects the band's sprawling landscape of sonic reference. The obvious suspects (the Beach Boys, Electric Light Orchestra) make appearances, but they're surrounded by funk, house, dancehall and, gulp, opera. In the wake of similar compilations like Grandaddy's Below the Radio, The Trip and Back to Mine series, and Optimo's How to Kill the DJ [Part Two] not to mention Now! That's What I Call Music SFA's picks bolster the case that the iPod age hasn't killed the mixtape, after all. Several tracks should be required listening: Sly and the Family Stone's \"Family Affair\", MC5's \"Kick Out the Jams\", and of course, the Beach Boys' shimmering \"Feel Flows\", originally from 1971's thenunderrated Surf's Up. However, this compilation also boasts a memorable rarity or two. For instance, it includes to my knowledge the first CD release (aside from a 2003, similarly SFAculled Mojo comp) of Dennis Wilson's lush 1970 Bside \"Lady\". The band's five members each contribute three selections to the effort, adding to the disc's diversity. Singer Gruff Rhys turns in some of the superest, furriest choices, representing Wales with the skewed, Left Bankelike chamberpop of the Gorky's Zygotic Minci stalker ballad \"Christina\" and some minimalist Welshlanguage synthrock by Datblygu that wouldn't be out of place on Rhys's recent solo album. Drummer Dafydd Ieuan turns in ELO's miniepic \"Telephone Line\", which is practically an SFA template. Predictably, keyboardist Cian Ciárán is responsible for a couple of electronic clubthumpers, Humanoid's \"Stakker Humanoid\" and Joey Beltram's \"Energy Flash\". But he also throws in the disc's classical number, Bizet's \"Pearl Fishers\". Underworld's \"Rez\", which beeps almost exactly like my girlfriend's alarm clock, was one of Ieuan's picks. It promises to be a Super Furry year: A singles compilation and Rhys's solo album came out (how do you say \"dropped\" in Welsh?) earlier in 2005, several of the band's finest records have just been reissued, and a new fulllength is on the way. It remains to be seen where the Super Furries, now more than a decade old, intend to go next. This Under the Influence set underscores where the band has come from, and it's a wonderful world. "}
