{"label":" Jetset","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/273/homepage_large.e3356657.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Paul Cooper","artist":"Arab Strap","title":"Elephant Shoe","text":" From the minds that mildly distressed their primary school teaching with a summer break report entitled Skag, Smokes, Buckfast, and Me comes more mumbling, more tossed off instrumentals, and still more stories of fumbled gropings. In other words, Scotland's most beautiful losers return to drive us stumbling for our Valiums and for soothing draughts of liquid Paxil. Despite licensing their debut single, \"The First Big Weekend of the Summer,\" for use in a Guinness ad, Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton are still pissed at life, love, and the faint glimmer of happiness. Moffat is still warning us against cheating girlfriends and the paranoias they cultivate. But the fact that solace is never found at the bottom of a pint glass doesn't deter him from questing for that miraculous alchemy. Arab Strap's music is still fractured, Smoglike, and woefully beautiful. The group's pitted, narky ambience fuses Irvine Welsh with Brian Eno's Another Green World Elephant Shoe is ambient for the Tamazipan massive. Deep farping organs ground \"Direction of a Strong Man\" as Arab Strap's fine sense of pop rears itself majestically out of the morose morass. \"One Four Seven One\" deals with the gnawing suspicions that sneaky lovers engender. They make us dial those four numbers in the British equivalent of *69. The song's itchy, scratchy triphop beats exacerbate Moffat's barely concealed anger. It's a telling understatement when he utters, \"I can't take this lightly; you said I'm in a huff.\" But the spindly, gangly guitar lines guide him though to his final disgust. Updating Jacques Brel's \"Ne Me Quitte Pas,\" Arab Strap offer \"Pajamas.\" Except that Moffat doesn't offer a night unlike any other night we've experienced if we stay. He mumbles, \"Shouldn't we be naked/ Especially tonight/ Instead of being fat/ Instead of being tight?/ If you go/ Go for good/ Don't fuckin' joke!\" Moffat suggests that his companion shouldn't wear pajamas \"in this heat,\" and grumbles about \"the pissed up kids in the street.\" A far cry from Brel's Elysian Promises! Can we condone lyrics like, \"We meet old friends at funerals/ And pretend that we've missed them\"? Can we recommend a band that consistently releases albums ringing with loathing and destitute of any joy? Would we be complicit in a reader's dive into the same deep quagmire where Moffat and Middleton have developed gills? Well, we should at least express a note of caution. Arab Strap's depression is as addictive as their expression of it is alluring. Elephant Shoe isn't shocking, outrageous, or source material for a \"Jerry Springer\" special. It has none of the alkie humor of their debut; it's even more cynical than Philophobia. It's the starkly pedestrian, accurate portrayal of many impoverished, dependent lives. Elephant Shoe is a beautiful public service announcement, a plea for more than politicians' platitudes and token welfare assistance. The strap is strong now, but one day it will snap. "}
