They don't have a biography on allmusic.com. As of the end of July, none of their releases on iTunes feature a single customer review. They're strangely underrepresented in the annals of pop music, even by the standards of overlooked pioneers. Blogger Matt Woebot set about trying to rectify this by putting their 1991 debut (and only fulllength) Reggae Owes Me Money at #7 on his list of the 100 Greatest Records Ever, one slot behind Kraftwerk's Computer World, calling it \"the best record to emerge out of the UK acid house sceneâ€¦ it's also, by default, the best record to come out of the UK's Dancehall scene. And the best Grime LP ever!\" It's a bit of canontweaking, sure, but the only fault with that particular summary is one of omission: The Ragga Twins, with the backing of legendary underground production team Shut Up and Dance, also happened to create the first great blueprint for jungle.Not exactly jungle as we remember it now, technically the Ragga Twins' 199092 output, which comprised the majority of their career work until their midaughts comeback, lacks the 150+ BPM pace and \"Amen\" breakchopping most obviously identified with the genre by 1994. But it was a solid prototype, as Soul Jazz's compilation Ragga Twins Step Out proves. A collection of nearly everything worth hearing from the crew, including several singles, two early preRagga Twins tracks, and all but two cuts from Reggae Owes Me Money, this 2xCD set is their definitive document at least as far as copyright can allow.Shut Up and Dance, comprised of Philip \"PJ\" Johnson and Carlton \"Smiley\" Hyman, were an upandcoming production duo with their own label, and one of their earliest releases forged their partnership with Trevor and David Destouche, better known as Flinty Badman and Deman Rocker. The two MCs were veterans of London's Unity sound system, and after SUAD came to Deman to ask for permission to sample his toasting for their 1989 12\" \"Lamborghini\", the Ragga Twins were born. The evolution was practically immediate: The two preSUAD cuts on this comp, \"Hard Drugs\" and the Thatcherbaiting \"Iron Lady\" (both recorded under the name Deman Rockers), are fine digital dancehall in the tradition of close Unity associate King Jammy. But once \"Ragga Trip\" dropped, with its TB303 acid house squelch and its unmistakable bboy drum break, things promised to be radically different. What arose was a sound that melded hiphop, digital dancehall, and acid something that you might get at the union of a Criminal Minded/\"Under Mi Sleng Teng\"/\"Voodoo Ray\" Venn diagram  and provided a rougher, streetlevel counterpoint to rave's giddy utopianism. Productionwise, some of this feels a little like a transitional waystation (albeit a crucial and exciting one) on the road to jungle, as the production on many of the tracks \"Rudeboy\", \"The Truth\", \"The Homeless Problem\" sound a bit more like hardcore techno and acid house gone extrafierce than a clear path towards drum'n'bass. But that doesn't necessarily make it archaic on its own, and even out of its turnofthenineties context the beats still sound rugged. The way \"18 Speaker\" welds downtempo dub to uptempo breaks isn't just a slick rhythmic maneuver, it's a particularly intense highwire act where spacedout piano and slow, rumbling bass battle with packed, charging beats. \"Wipe the Needle\", meanwhile, takes a sample of Mantronix's classic electro monster \"Bassline\", rivets a harder, faster beat to it and cranks up the intensity from headbobbing to armwaving.And if the production didn't always anticipate jungle, the MCing definitely did. Flinty and Deman's booming voices weren't just conduits for Shut Up and Dance's production style, they were the ideal complement, ratcheting up the intensity and grime in the lyrical content as sure as the beats raised the stakes for hardcore. \"Ragga Trip\" a rewrite of \"Hard Drugs\" is about the dangers of getting fucked up on heavy narcotics at raves, \"Illegal Gunshot\" relates a club shooting scenario, and classic badman themes and invocations crop up in cuts like \"Rudeboy\" and \"Hooligan 69\" (included here as a remix; the original's Prince samples proved unclearable). While SUAD's production nicely accommodated guest spots from sweetsinging reggae stars like Junior Reid (\"Shine Eye\") and Richie Davis (\"Good Times\"), its primary purpose was to give early90s rave a dancehall ruggedness, a task that Flinty and Deman would parlay into an explosive underground movement.Which brings us to a bit of sad irony: Shut Up and Dance nearly got sued out of existence when their 1992 production \"Raving, I'm Raving\" drew some unwanted attention for an uncleared sample of Marc Cohn's \"Walking in Memphis\". Left without a label, the Ragga Twins wound up signing with EMI, and in 1995 when they could have been kneedeep in the jungle scene they helped spark they instead wound up recording the Australiaonly Rinsin' Lyrics, a jazzinfluenced record produced by Us3 (remember those guys? \"Cantaloop\"? Yeah). Despite a hiatus for much of the late 90s and early aughts, the Ragga Twins have endured, and they're still working in scenes ranging from drum'n'bass (numerous electroinflected cuts with Aquasky) to dubstep (\"Reverse Rebel\", from Neil Landstrumm's superlative Restaurant of Assassins). But by making a lot of previouslyscarce material accessible once again, Ragga Twins Step Out should hopefully help shed a bit more light on how much they really mean to the sound of London. "}
