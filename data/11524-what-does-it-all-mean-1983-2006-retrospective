Steve Stein was far from a dilettante; as one half of the megamixspecialist duo Double Dee and Steinski, he was already deep enough into the embryonic genre to change the game with his first release, 1983's epochal sampleslayer \"Lesson 1 (The Payoff Mix)\". A track they put together for a remix contest (which they won handily), \"The Payoff Mix\" was a rework of G.L.O.B.E. & Whiz Kid's \"Play That Beat Mr. DJ\" that didn't just wrap the Tommy Boy electro joint around the appropriate references to \"Rock It\" and \"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\", but threw in all kinds of Casablanca soundbites and dance instructor lessons and Little Richard vocals, too. Never mind that they weren't virtuoso DJs and actually put the whole thing together using an 8track recorder and a tape deck; this took hiphop's tradition of reformatting existing material and made it a postmodern funhouse. For a generation raised on the 30second educational minifilms of \"Sesame Street\" and the fleeting stimulus of channel surfing, Steinski's own recipe for ricocheting attention spans was a natural fit: lay down a beat, switch it up a bunch of times to keep things jumping, weave in a bunch of thematic, sometimes smartassed clips of TV news voiceovers or political speeches, and damn the lawyers. It was already wellknown how legally dicey and largely unreleaseable his music was back in March 1986, when critic Robert Christgau wrote a Village Voice article referring to this music with the headline \"Great Dance Records You Can't Buy\", but he got right to the heart of Steinski's soundbite technique when he dubbed him \"a perpetually disillusioned optimist who still assumes that the sounds and images rippling through the American consciousness are, forget copyright, every American's birthright.\" Not long afterwards, Steinski would release \"The Motorcade Sped On\", a dance record about the JFK assassination that was difficult to get into the American consciousness unless said American was able to subscribe to the NME, where it was given away as a flexidisc. In fact, with most of Steinski's material previously only available in bootleg form, the 2xCD bestof What Does It All Mean? 19832006 Retrospective does a great service in collecting all his prime material in one place not just the bulk of his solo work, but the entirety of his 2002 BBC/Solid Steel rough mix Nothing to Fear, widely considered one of the best mixes of the last several years.Nothing to Fear might be the surprise highlight of this collection, even accounting for all the classic stuff on the first disc. It's nice to hear Steinski do his thing for more than just a few minutes at a time, and at just under an hour, it's got a lot of crazy notions, elbowribbing and sharp gags packed into its running time, even as it maintains a deep focus on also acting as something danceable. The recognizable (Blackalicious' \"Swan Lake\"; Nelly's \"Country Grammar\"; De La Soul's \"The Art of Getting Jumped\") segues easily into the arcane; there'll be a number of times you'll hear a naggingly familiar yet unplaceable oldschool bboy break, and it might wind up driving you nuts. It's all bolstered by a succession of punchlines and soundbites that nudge each other out of the way even as they create a multigenerational stream of consciousness: there's Glengarry Glen Ross, \"Rocky & Bullwinkle\", and Groucho Marx; there's preachers, comedians, and a selfaware drop of Louis Farrakhan exclaiming to the attendees of Jack the Rapper's 1980 convention that \"white people are in the business of mind control\"; there's foleyroom clips of \"Star Trek\" sound effects and pratfall bone fractures; there are recontextualized koans and truisms: \"this is a special magic,\" \"wait a minute are you guys actually gonna go through with this thing?\", \"the airwaves are sacred.\" Steinski doesn't shy away from his elder statesman status on this mix (one semiappalled ident: \"he's old enough to be my father!\"), but the oldschoolmeetsnewschool feeling makes his earlyfifties age irrelevant; so much gets thrown at you through this mix that its allegiance to any kind of specific signifiers coasts, styles, eras, generations, anything deeper than \"hiphop in general\" is practically nil.  A greater insight into Steinski's style and sonic identity is, of course, available on the first disc, ranging from straightup bboy anthems into unnerving, borderline avantgarde looks into some of America's bleakest moments. By 1985 Steinski and his partner Double Dee had crafted two additional \"Lessons\" to augment \"The Payoff Mix\". \"Lesson 2 (James Brown Mix)\" is selfexplanatory: At a time when the 808 still ruled rap production, it was an unusual and prescient idea to string together a track interweaving some traditional hiphop touchstones (\"Apache\", \"Double Dutch Bus\") with a number of different fragments from several of James Brown's funk hits; all that remained was for the Bomb Squad to perfect the science. \"Lesson 3 (History of Hip Hop)\" from 1985; talk about your unfinished story cements the historical import of the genre's breakbeat aspect via a smartly hijacked JFK quote (\"the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans\"), a nod to Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" and goto breakbeats like Dennis Coffey's \"Scorpio\" and Herman Kelly & Life's \"Dance to the Drummer's Beat\". And the two reunion tracks that Double Dee and Steinski made together after over a decade apart 1998's hyperactive, elastic, almost completely transformative oldschool funkparty remix of Bambaataa's \"Jazzy Sensation\" and 1999's quickcutting, labelspanning ultramix \"Voice Mail (Sugar Hill Suite)\" reveal a certain giddiness over being able to work with classic material again.  But while there's plenty of strength in his later material the velvet scuzz of Coldcutcollaborative phonesex pastiche \"I'm Wild About That Thing\", the sinister bopfunk of \"Vox Apostolica\", \"Ain't No Thing\", which expertly stitches together selections from Stones Throw's The Third Unheard: Connecticut HipHop 19791983 comp Steinski's most daring work is in controversycourting, culturejamming political needling. The juxtaposition of asithappens news clips with pop debris in \"The Motorcade Sped On\" the intro to \"The Tonight Show\", the first note of the Beatles' \"A Hard Day's Night\", and the cowbell of the Rolling Stones' \"Honky Tonk Women\" slowed to a slumpshouldered skulk is tasteless in theory, but the sense of panic and confusion that Steinski puts together through repetition and multilayered, oftenclashing sounds manages to give it an unnerving gravity. 1992's \"It's Up to You (Television Mix)\" builds on a catchy loop of the Jackson 5's \"It's Great to Be Here\" and creates one of the few antiGulf War protest songs of the era, transforming Bush's speech into a pop hook (\"Regrettably, we now believe/ That only force will make him leave\") and interspersing quotes from Jello Biafra (\"don't hate the media, become the media!\") and Mario Savio's famous 1964 address to the Berkeley Free Speech Movement.  And then there's the last track, the previouslyunreleased \"Number Three on Flight Eleven\", which weaves audio of Betty Ong's cell phone call from United Flight 11 on 9/11 into an unsettling, ambient Enoesque dirge the only track on this compilation that's legitimately difficult to listen to. \"Lesson 2\" answered this collection's titular question with a quote from Fab 5 Freddy's \"Change the Beat\" (\"this stuff is really fresh\"), but it's also deep. And probably illegal, too, but that just makes it an essential crime.  "}
