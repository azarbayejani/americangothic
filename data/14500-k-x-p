{"label":" Smalltown Supersound","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/15554/homepage_large.198f8d67.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"K-X-P","title":"K-X-P","text":" Some music resists characterization, such as the selftitled debut from the quixotically named KXP. The Finnish sortatrio comes with good bona fides: two drummers, Anssi Nykänen and Tomi Leppanen plus Annie producer/cosongwriter Timo Kaukolampi, and all are good friends with the inimitable DJ duo Optimo, who invited them to perform at one of their last Sunday club nights at Glasgow's Sub Club earlier this year.To an extent, you can understand KXP's appeal to dance floorfriendly artists; their music is incredibly rhythmic, their grooves paranoid dark disco and motorik deep. The pulsing beat that kicks off \"Mehu Moments\", for example, is so nervewracking that you can practically see a redflashing siren while you're listening to it. And yet this record manages to sound loose and offthecuff, positively alive and experimental. New elements within these eight compositions seem to arise out of thin air, like the ripples of melody that erupt throughout \"Mehu Moments\" or the streaks of weeping keyboard sounds stretching out \"Aibal Dub\". Sometimes it all sounds delightfully improvisational.Thing is, though, these songs are way too selfcontained to be the result of compiledtogether jam sessions. While KXP can get a little rote and sameysounding at times, every song feels compact despite their running time (only the brightlyhumming \"Epilogue\" makes it under the fourminute mark). That structural conciseness could ostensibly be attributed to Kaukolampi's pop pedigree; thing is, though, it's pretty much the only discernible trace that any member of KXP's worked with more conventional forms of music.The two most conceivably \"straightforward\" cuts here, \"18 Hours (of Love)\" and \"Pockets\", are also the two most menacing. The former uses Gary Glitter drums and lowbellowed vocals to create what sounds like a Satanic romantic ballad, while the latter's spangled disco touches are offset by maniacal postpunk howls. Take a listen to Kaukolampi's rework of \"Pockets\" featuring redone vocals from Annie herself, then, and you'll wonder whether or not there's a big beating pop heartbeat (not \"Heartbeat\") lying under each and every song on this album, which is a shapeshifting puzzle that is as fun to pick apart as it is to simply take in and enjoy.
