{"label":" Dare to Care","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13706/homepage_large.76ecc34d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Malajube","title":"Labyrinthes","text":" \"Malajube's music is labyrinthine,\" Pitchfork's Brian Howe wrote by way of praising the French Montreal band's breakout sophomore album,  Trompel'Oeil  , in 2006. With their city then under the indie rock microscope, Malajube (still say it MALazhoob) scanned as yet more ramshackle hyperpop, language less a  barrier  than a Dungenesque point of difference when it counted, say on the hook to commercialbait standout \"Montréal 40°C\", these inaugural Polaris Music Prize nominees sounded no more francophone than, I dunno, Electric Light Orchestra. Media hype now gone home, Malajube up the labyrinthine stakes on  Labyrinthes  , daring reentry. It's not for the faint of heart or the fain to double back.How do you say \"gone all prog\"  en français  ? The change is as much context as content multipart  Trompe  miniepics \"La Monogamie\" and \"Le Crabe\" already were reminiscent of contemporaries such as Mew but jarring structural changes are the norm on  Labyrinthes  , suggesting Malajube's former \"progressive emo jam band\" MySpace descriptor may have been more apt than absurd. Sixminute opener \"Ursuline\" boldly announces the new approach and, if you understand the submerged lyrics (or read the interviews), the Catholicism/mortalityminded lyrical themes as blistering guitar solos, chopsy drumming, and portentous chants descend upon a placid piano intro, leaving only church bells in their wake. Juxtapositions juice a couple of the best songs: \"Casablanca\", which veers from hazy Tropicáliatinged pop to a fleetfingered guitar coda, and \"333\", all gallops and screeches and echoes except when its inner \"Dust in the Wind\" breaks out.Where Malajube fall flat, it's not due to complexity, but grim reality: Comedy rarely translates well. Jerry Lewis, anyone? \"It's good to have humor in music too,\" drummer Francis Mineau, lead singer Julien Mineau's brother, told the  National Post  . The most immediately accessible tracks here spiky video selection \"Porté Disparu\", with its Ed Woodworthy synth line, or the harmony and pianodriven \"Luna\" translate as lighthearted whether you know that \"Les Collemboles\" refers to eating bugs someday or just like to hum along with its callandresponse chorus. The more sinister \"Le ToutPuissant\" and \"Cristobald\" convey instrumental prowess and grandiosity, sure, but I could use a pie in the face (OK, the closing growls  almost  count). So although  Labyrinthes  further establishes Malajube as French Canadians worth following, this time you may not make it far enough to save your brother from the Goblin King. "}
