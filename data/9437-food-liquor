Which is not to say he's untalented he is, extraordinarily so. The Chicago MC sports one of the slipperiest flows I've heard in a long time he's dexterous but never technical, sly but not arrogant. He rarely hangs on syllables too long and never wastes a word. And words are plentiful on his debut album, the longdelayed Food & Liquor. Fiasco's a selfproclaimed entrepreneur wading against a current he can't seem to condone: Hiphop circa 2006. His first album's the work of an MC in love with rap's freedom of expression but at odds with its current landscape. Where Fiasco misses classic status is his sonic approach. The album's sound produced in large part by the 1st and 15th Productions duo Soundtrakk and Prolyfic is clearly influenced by the bombastic derringdo of Kanye West's Late Registration, the record on which Fiasco was famously introduced. Much of Food & Liquor is draped in stuttering, chopped strings and blaring guitar. Tracks like \"He Say She Say\" and \"Sunshine\", with their sweeping violas, sound like manipulative film music, undermining an MC bursting with enthusiasm by portraying him as some sort of epic figure, here to erase and rewrite rap lore. Call it ScoreHop only the sentiment doesn't match the performer, particularly for a rapper blowing up because he wrote a deft song about skateboarding. He also blogs, loves anime, and collects toys. Not exactly the stuff of Tolstoy. Where West mined humor and pathos out of his delusional grandiosity, Lupe too often falls back on smug infighting. On the closing verse of the mostly sublime Jill Scottassisted jazz joint \"Daydreamin'\", Fiasco with the wily tone of a nasally ChiAli mocks his peers. \"Now come on everybody, let's make cocaine cool/ We need a few more halfnaked women up in the pool,\" he raps. Only seconds later he swallows the shit and stops grinning, opting for introspection: \"I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy/ And all the televisions out there that raised me.\" Why the ridicule before the contemplation? Maybe it lies in Fiasco's faith, which dictates some of his preachier verses. The influence is clear on \"Intro\", which echoes the opening track of Mos Def's debut, and the brilliant screed \"American Terrorist\".  More troubling is Fiasco's apparent inability to write fly hooks. While his verses are packed with wit and double meaning, his hooks are mostly blandlysung, unmemorable couplets. This highlights what may be Food & Liquor's biggest flaw: It's just not that fun. This is not to say there isn't a place for grand, thoughtful hiphop there isn't nearly enough. But on the strength of his 1st and 15th mixtapes, the joyful \"Kick, Push\", and effervescent \"I Gotcha\" one the best Neptunes tracks in years Fiasco's at his best when he's a bit livelier. This is to say nothing of \"Outro\", another grandiloquent production, minus the intelligence. It's 12 minutes (!) of Lupe shouting out people like MTV, his nieces, nephews, and his \"big homie Shondell.\" It's barely listenable once, let alone repeatable. There is also a track on here produced by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda featuring onelinedrawing's Jonah Matranga of which we will say no more.  Of course, this sounds negative, but it's more the notes of a slightly disappointed fan. I never fell in love with the highly regarded leak of this album months ago, but this is an improvement, with futurofunk tracks like \"The Cool\" (from Kanye West) and \"I Gotcha\" added to the mix. The album's best song, \"Hurt Me Soul\", is as ostentatiously conceived as much of the album, brimming with lush strings and a single plinking piano courtesy of Needlz his only solo production.  Lyrically, Fiasco is vivid and nimble and appealingly contradictory. He opens with the accusatory, \"I used to hate hiphop, yup, because of the women degraded\" and then explains he was swayed by Too $hort's humor. He later questions JayZ (a noted supporter of Fiasco's) and his \"never prayed to God, I pray to Gotti\" credo from \"D'Evils\", only to become a convert after his 30th viewing of \"Streets Is Watching\" which has him \"back to givin' props again.\" All essential battles for any serious hiphop fan. But this is a tough tightrope for any MC to walk and Lupe is let down by what is supposed to be this album's selling point: the music.  Reportedly Fiasco modeled Food & Liquor after Nas' adventurous if overblown followup to Illmatic, It Was Written. This illuminates everything. Fiasco's putting the Phantom before the horse, so to speak. He hasn't released a classic, gritty album yet. Instead he's attempted to ascend to a status he hasn't earned, and frankly, shouldn't want. This is no call for Lupe to tone down his aggressively thoughtful themes, merely to reframe them. He doesn't have to be a savior. There's no one to save.  "}
