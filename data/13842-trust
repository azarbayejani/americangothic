{"label":" Kompakt","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/14880/homepage_large.b2a63cdc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Colly","artist":"Kaito","title":"Trust","text":" Of the many insults hurled at Jay Leno during his current beef with Conan O'Brien and NBC, the one that most stuck out to me was Nathan Rabin's claim in the Wall Street Journal that Leno \"suffers from a terrible dearth of personal demons. [He] is so normal and functional that he's practically a freak.\" Comedians are selfloathers by nature, and Leno is too well adjusted to be funny, the argument follows. While Japanese producer Hiroshi Watanabe shares no notable similarities with Leno, I've always felt kind of the same way about the music Watanabe makes as Kaito his take on deep house, which incorporates elements of trance and minimal, is generally so pleasant and optimistic that it almost seems benign.The more frequent, concrete criticism of Kaito who, with clear ties to the oftmaligned 90s trance scene, is something of an anomaly on Kompakt it's that he seems to be making the same record over and over. Kaito's breakout was 2002's Special Life, an album that won folks over for its reimagining of trance as a worthy component of chic modern techno and offered for many a lively alternative to Kompakt's usual stately bounce. Since then, though, Kaito has seemed content resting on his laurels, doing little to tweak or improve upon his signature sound a blend of swooshing synths and tightly packed keyboard trills presented in a happygolucky style.Boasting song titles like \"Rainbow Circles\" and \"The Breath of Spring\", his latest LP,Â Trust, mostly follows suit, and will disappoint those who'd hoped Kaito would explore different narrative or sonic threads this time around. But wishing an artist will do what you think he should is a fool's errand, and Kaito's confident enough in his chosen approach to make up for a lack of inventiveness with tracks that carry a good amount of punch. On \"Spring\" and \"Nothing Could Be More Peaceful\", he employs breakbeats (something he's done before with success), setting them behind grand keyboard arrangements in such a way that lends depth and a herkyjerky momentum. Roughly 75 minutes long, the record takes a turn for the better around the halfway point when Kaito introduces some muchneeded mystery via icy synth lines on the title track. The songs that follow flit between John Hughesian M83 instrumentals (\"We Are Living Here\") and more classically Kompakt minimal pieces (\"It Happens Suddenly\") but ultimately just seem too polite for their own good.
