As the frontman of Residual Echoes, he's crafted folkrock drenched in acid and hung out to dripdry in the California sun for almost seven years. But there's something about Dead Head that despite being Payne's ninth official release feels like a debut record.It could be that this is the first solidified lineup of the band's history (drummer Allen Bleyle and bassist Greg Arnold make up the rhythm section); it could be that this record sounds far more polished than the rough, almost demolike quality of past albums; but it's mostly because Dead Head has a greater sense of purpose than anything previously bearing the Residual Echoes name. After folky intro \"Warts\", the album goes into warp speed for the rest of its 38minute run, with incinerating guitar solos shooting sparks all over the place.More than twothirds of \"Chopper\" is filled with this blistering sixstring work, taking exploratory detours and tossing in a couple of seconds of stark silence before the blistering climax, recalling the nimble (and outrageously loud) fretwork of J Mascis. In fact, about six of the album's nine tracks adhere to this same template: fast tempo, exploratory guitar solo, hell, they're almost all written in the same key. The solos are always interesting, even bordering on remarkable, but the songs suffer from a lack of more diverse songwriting. The album's highlight, \"Fugks\", slows down the tempo and builds around a gorgeously laidback quasisurf riff before settling into Neil Younginspired songwriting. Sadly, it's one of the album's rare diversions into stylistic variety.Essentially, Dead Head actually does play like Residual Echoes' debut release; everything is urgent and highstakes, but it sounds more like the work of a young band settling into a sound, rather than a seasoned band knowing what works and using it as a springboard to see what else they can do.
