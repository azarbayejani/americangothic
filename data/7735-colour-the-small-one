Propped up by her label as an occidental answer to Lauryn Hill and Nelly Furtado, her unique Adelaide croon broke through on the surprise British smash \"Taken for Granted\" in 2000. Unfortunately, her miniature name and jazzy, danceable 2001 debut invited unending comparisons to thenubiquitous Dido; after the toothache vocals she lent Zero 7's downtempo UK hit Simple Things, Sia was frantic for a way out of the \"sultry diva\" box. Zero 7's record collection unsurprisingly eclectic as their chief inspiration, Air proved her escape.Colour the Small One rebuffs critical expectation, retreating into acoustic guitars, carousel strings and plenty of drum loops, in places strikingly reminiscent of a longtime American hairtwirler, the often maudlin Lisa Germano. Furler's breathy moans and comparatively morose music are the result of more than career frustration, however: while she was on holiday following a tour with Zero 7, the man she considers her \"first true love\" was struck and killed by a taxi in Kensington. Nothing on this album outlines her collapsed desperation like the brutal \"Breathe Me\", with its overwhelming chorus of childlike cries: \"Be my friend/ Hold me/ Wrap me up/ Unfold me/ I am small/ And needy.\" As can be expected, tragedy has tapped a wellspring of creative energy, but the music built around Sia's words is still aimed at the radio, overstuffed with melodies and cinematic melodrama, exemplified by the swelling strings and morbid piano closing this otherwise excellent forthcoming single. Clumsily, and not very convincingly, Sia turns her back on angst in \"The Bully\". Obviously cowritten with Beck, the track is pure fluff, a dizzy midtempo backdrop of vibe hits and summery acoustic guitar designed solely to showcase Sia's dazedandawake sexuality. Its closing refrain is catchy enough, but nowhere near as memorable as albumopener \"Rewrite\", whose melody and slurred delivery are eerily reminiscent of Lisa Germano's stark Lullaby for Liquid Pig. For this considerably darker comparison, the Dido tag isn't completely scratched off Sia's reputation, a point driven home by the pedestrian positivity of \"Sunday\", where she advises, \"It will be okay/ Do nothing today/ Give yourself a break/ Let your imagination run away.\" She hasn't yet crossed the bridge to Terabithia. Advance single \"Don't Bring Me Down\" and the offkilter accordion waltz \"Butterflies\" have thus far been the talking points of Colour the Small One. Whoever's to blame management or artist they chose the wrong single, as the former is a dolledup, halfasleep stab at commercial triphop starving for a good hook: In all her rummaging through Zero 7's Nick Drake and James Taylor albums, she'd have done well to revisit Tasmin Archer. \"Butterflies\", on the other hand, shows what mainstream artists can learn from old folk records, infusing upfront acoustic plucking with vibes, oboe, psychedelic keys and the drunken pitterpatter of a latenight jazz snare. Her sneering, raspy delivery is a welcome moment of pure personality on a record that frequently fades into its background. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the heavy emotional inspiration behind Sia's trebly moans drags on over the course of 50 minutes. \"Moon\" and \"The Church of What's Happening\" are middling repetitions on Colour the Small One's acoustic triphop theme, and needlessly delay the arrival of sharp shouldbesingles \"Numb\" and the Furtadofrenzied finale \"Where I Belong\". It's always a smart play to leave the listener wanting more, but you have to bring them all the way through for it to work. Hardly easy listening, Sia's downtempo kaleidoscope of pain and progress is unable to hold on to all that it reaches for, but delivers moments of brilliance and daring that upstage the pop divas she'd rather not be associated with.
