And that's because over the past six years White Lung have functioned in a distinctly underground and subversive mode. They've trekked Canada and the States on DIY tours through venues so small I inadvertently knocked into a mic stand when I saw them last month, in the stageless, graffitistrewn backroom of a dingy Brooklyn tavern. And their fast and frightening 19minute sophomore record, Sorry, was out earlier this year on the small, hardcoreoriented Canadian label Deranged, which also released some of the first material from a similarly pummeling group, Fucked Up. But despite White Lung's threatening devotion to the more venomous corners of rapidfire punk, Sorry is compulsively listenable due in no small part to singer Mish Way's successful pinning of a sweet spot between snarled yells, curled syllables, and melodic but equally intimidating, tobaccotattered verse. The band's template recalls the earliest recordings by Hole, Babes in Toyland, or L7 Way is not shy about her affinity for Courtney Love but compressed and spedup to mimic the motions of classic 1980s hardcore. The latter is rooted mostly in the thoroughly relentless, rocketspeed drumming of AnneMarie Vassiliou through the record's every track, which seems to know only one method of shifting tempo (\"faster\"). If those aforementioned riot grrrl references sound superficial, consider Way's own description of her band's sound: \"like the feeling you get when you pee on the prego stick and it shows you a plus sign.\"  Way's most compelling moments on Sorry are those in which she's particularly hellish, strong, and lyrically bold. \"Wipe that look from your face/ I'll drop you back from where you came,\" she screams within the first 40 seconds of opener \"Take the Mirror\", over guitarist Kenneth Williams' subtle but noiseladen postpunk riffage. That fury returns on the hooky \"Glue\", where Way declares \"You're a dead horse riding/ I'm out for you.\" These moments seem designed for thrashing pitlevel shoutalongs, as does the cautionary chorus on \"Bag\". Elsewhere Way muses bloody and visceral lines that hone on the body, like \"Bunny\", where she ferociously sings \"I'll scrub your liver clean until I die,\" or \"Bad Way\", in which she melodically describes a collapsing face and snapping veins over some of the record's most scratched, anxious fretwork. Sorry has hardly got a distracted moment, but \"Thick Lip\" stands out as the band's most abrasive, collective assault. It functions like a sonic declaration of war, one that comes into focus as Way's lyrics acknowledge \"a pretty young girl\" in the back of your mind: \"We don't have real heads/ Instead we got legs,\" she shouts, setting off a tirade of lines that seem to hint at topical criticisms of backwards beauty standards. \"I know your big secret/ It's caked on your face,\" Way wages, and then the killer: \"I know that you're better/ Than most of this world/ But your thick dumb lips/ Tell a real dumb truth.\" Interpret that one as you wish. Way pierces the song with a clear, perpetual shriek \"WHAT DID HE SAY?\" that feels like one of her definitive moments. Not every girl is a riot grrrl, but here Way quite undeniably carries a torch for feminist punk heroes of decades past while sounding entirely present. And so add White Lung to the everwidening pool of contemporary bands drawing from punk and hardcore but staking their own territory: Iceage, the Men, and Cloud Nothings, for example. They might work off old reference points, but White Lung are architects of a raw sound that feels novel and ideal in 2012: inventive, precise guitar textures, palatable pop hooks, and terrifying speed. Recently, Way, who is also a writer, mused on her place in the underground punk scene: \"The common understanding [is] that being in a band is not a viable career option,\" she wrote. \"We'll celebrate breaking even after every [selfbooked] tour... and that's totally okay with me.\" Time will tell if that will remain the case for White Lung. For now Sorry is their loudest statement yet. "}
