From: Shamra Tunsa Subject: Deftones Review Pitchdorks, \\x93Deftones sounds more like a band in the throws of a midlife crisis than a group of musicians that could be called the 'Radiohead of Metal'. This is music on the fencepost of popular pining and dulled experimentation, an anachronistic addition to an otherwise respectable discography, and it will be remembered as such.\\x94 ARE YOU FUCKIN KIDDING ME!?!? Andrew Bryant should be drowned in a capsized portapotty for writing bullshit like this! How did he get hired, is he someone's cousin or fuckbuddy or something?Deftones is probably the greatest album to be released this entire fuckin year! Maybe its just that Andy couldx92t hear how awesome \\x93When Girls Telephone Boys\\x94 and \\x93BattleAxe\\x94 are with his head stuck so far up his own ass. How can anyone say these kickass songs are anywhere near that pussy Linkin Park shit? Also, I'd like to call his bluff regarding the lyrics to \\x93Moana\\x94. \\x93These are just the kind of 9thgrade poetic flubs found in the bottomleft hand corner of my old Earth Science primer.\\x94 If Andrew Bryant is so fuckin talented, how come the only songs he liked were the shitty ones? \\x93Lucky You\\x94 and \\x93Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event\\x94? Dude how many Cure albums does a guy have to swallow to fully appreciate the sappy filler on albums like this? Only little girls would pick the emo piano shit on a Metal album. Bryant shows his true elitist colors picking on the programmed drums in \"Lucky You\" instead of actually paying attention he might notice how well the group interchanges the quietloudquiet motif with moments of silence. I hope you fire him, he obviously has no idea what good music is. shamra tunsa Pitchfork Review: Deftones: DeftonesBecause we're all individuals, except for you. From: Connor Kiley Subject: p4k, sold out? Ryan, Did Pitchfork strike a deal with Viacom or something? Why all the recent reviews of major label bands (Led Zeppelin, Metallica...ok I can see Liz Phair but the Deaftones)? I mean, ok, yeah, I liked The Cure in high school, these mallrat idiots suckered me with \\x93Minerva\\x94 a few years back, but the rest of their catalog, or what I've heard of it, is crass commercial melodrama on par with Marilyn Manson. Even the tracks with hardcore roots \\x93Bloody Cape\\x94 and \\x93Good Morning Beautiful\\x94, for example reek of Moreno's guilty conscience. He's stuck playing to teenage goth metal fans while pretending he's all \"indie rock\" because he's heard MBV and The Smiths. Yeah dude, those records are wicked hard to come by! Ok, \\x93Hexagram\\x94 may distinguish them from Staind and Korn with all the chugging, but only in the eyes of future generations, 'cos any praise wasted on this shit is splitting already thin hairs and I'd rather rip a few off that pieface's doublechincloaking goatee. Atkins, dude, not facial hair. For every one of Deftones' highlights (wait, is there more than one?), there are twelve cartoonish attempts at reclaiming the \\x93olddays\\x94 of a fuckin outright embarrassment to begin with: xFC metal. Ever since Tool started with their drama club metal, TSR teens have been rolling twentysided dice and donning black leather overcoats like it's going out of style. NEWSFLASH: Skinny kids look even scrawnier in those things, and fat kids, dude, just roll with the roll what, you're magically gonna drop the tire in the unlikely event a girl gets past all five buckles on that cape? Oh, but \"Needles and Pins\\x94, man, give me a break, is this fuckin Limp Bizkit? Listen to that fuckin' chorus and this record HAS to get a 0.0. \"Who wants to fuck with us now?\\x94 I mean that's just fuckin' pure Iron Maiden nonsense, and you guys are actually debating this record's place in comparison to real artists like Single Frame (thanks for the tip) or even Radiohead. Oh, then that whimpering little \"serious song\", \\x93Deathblow\\x94. What a fuckin title. Deathblow. Why not call it fucking \"Columbine\", dudes. Their attempt at ambient space and fuzzed out guitar would be laughable, but the irony of a line like \\x93It's still the same song/ It's still the same song\\x94 only merits something equally retarded: I'm ROTFLMAO. Pitchfork is above this, and I hope you just chuck this pandering major label coverage policy out the window with Brent D's hatemail. Sincerely, Connor Kiley PS: Are you hiring? Pitchfork Review: Deftones: DeftonesHail to the man who prefers Chino to York(e).
