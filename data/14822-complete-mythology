{"label":" Numero Group","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/15905/homepage_large.50c9f7ce.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Douglas Wolk","artist":"Syl Johnson","title":"Complete Mythology","text":" Syl Johnson is there's no other way to put it an alsoran. A very good singer, a pretty good guitar player, a fine songwriter, a canny reader of the zeitgeist, he was a fixture on the Chicago soul scene on and off for decades. He made the R&B charts 19 times over the years, but never really broke through to a pop audience. His records are mostly out of print, his big numbers all but forgotten although he did apparently make a killing from all the hiphop records that sampled Morris Jennings' breakbeat and Minnie Riperton's giggle from his 1967 single \"Different Strokes\".So the Numero Group's comprehensive box set of Johnson's 19591971 material is a labor of love four CDs, packaged with six LPs of the same material and an extensive booklet, drawn from releases on half dozen or so labels and encompassing a bit of unreleased material, too. This isn't even the full career survey its title implies; more than half of his 19 R&B hits happened after the period documented here, the bulk of them on Hi Records, where he was effectively the secondtier Al Green. (His only Top10 R&B hit was a cover of Green's \"Take Me to the River\".) It's a tribute to a local guy who really made good only long after the fact.\"Something is holding me back\", Johnson sang on one of his most potent songs. \"Is it because I'm black?\" Well, of course and he addressed racism pretty directly on some of his 19691970 recordings. But that wasn't what was holding him back within the R&B context, at least not directly. He spent most of the era covered here on tiny Chicago independent labels that didn't have any other big acts, most famously Twilight, aka Twinight, in which he was a shareholder. A lot of his mid60s material was indifferently recorded at best. He didn't have a consistent band on record the way most hitmakers of his era did, although he did work with some good ones. (He recorded a handful of these songs in Memphis with the firstrate band who'd later back him up at Hi, including the hit \"Dresses Too Short\", whose attitude  is very much of its time: \"Just because I whistle at you/ You say that I'm doin' you wrong/ Why do you blame me, baby?/ I didn't tell you to put it on.\")The broader problem, though, was that he was a totally solid talent in an era of greatness, a deft trendspotter in a period of nonstop innovation. He was a hard shouter, but not quite as hard as Wilson Pickett or James Brown; he was funny, but not as funny as Joe Tex, whose \"Skinny Legs and All\" he answered with \"I'll Take Those Skinny Legs\". Despite the liner notes' questionable argument that 1970's Is It Because I'm Black was \"the first black concept album,\" he wasn't a conceptualist he was a hitchaser.And sometimes he got there: \"Come on Sock it to Me\", \"Concrete Reservation\", the Donny Hathawayarranged \"One Way Ticket to Nowhere\". The market actually did lift up his best material. (The only really essential nonhit here is a long, sparkspitting funk workout, \"Right On\", in which he shouts out the Pieces of Peace, the best Chicago band he got to work with.) If you're looking for an introduction to Johnson's preHi era, the singledisc Chicago Twinight Soul is a lot more compact, and hits almost all of the peaks. What's most interesting about Complete Mythology, though, is the distance between the best stuff and everything else the context that shows what it took for a hardworking, deeply independentminded R&B singer to try to break through at a time when a hit could come from anywhere.
