An album of strictly Christmas fare, it is the work of Cee Lo the entertainer, a brand extension of his poppersona witnessed every week on \"The Voice\", America's best worstmazing singing competition show, where he is a coach/judge. If you were hoping for Cee Lo bringing in Big Gipp and putting the Dungeon Family treatment to \"Rudolph the RedNosed Reindeer\", you best look elsewhere for that freaky yuletide. That is not to say that Magic Moment isn't a pleasure to listen to. It is! Especially if you are fond of Christmas standards and loud singing. As Green said of himself recently, \"No one does soul like Cee Lo Green.\" It's true. No one else on contemporary pop radio carries the torch for true soul singing and vintage R&B hooks like he does. On Magic Moment, Green does a lot of broadstrokes Motown updates (\"White Christmas\"); the triumphant production, a locomotive backbeat paired with sleigh bells, is a veritable tribute to Phil Spector's classic 1963 holiday comp A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector.  It would seem that Magic Moment is the work of popsavvy Green gunning for the kind of hits that a regular album of his would not provide. There is something here for everyone, or perhaps rather, every standardized radio format; if Green is gunning for holiday omniscience from now until the end of Christmas, he has plotted a sure and failproof course with Magic Moment. There is the playful jazz shufflecummelismatic exercise of \"Baby It's Cold Outside\", featuring Christina Aguilera, the heavy Christian mojo of \"Mary, Did You Know?\". The avec Rod Stewart \"Merry Christmas, Baby\", its airlessness cementing a hallowed space on Lite FM from now until the sun swallows the Earth. Magic Moment's most curious collaboration is with the Muppets on his original, \"All I Need Is Love\", which is built on a sample of their beloved \"Mahna Mahna\". Green's singing here is not his most nuanced; he's singing at the middlelow end of his range, not in his trademark reedy voice. There is a lot of loud, fullbore belting. It's a little showboaty and on occasion his voice threatens to overpower the song itself (\"Silent Night\") perhaps a bit of pandering for \"Voice\" viewers who only know him from the show, which is a cavalcade of overthetop, soulful shouting. Still, not a note of Magic Moment rings false. Green sounds like he really has been waiting all year to trap unsuspecting people under the mistletoe; clawing his presents open like a wolverine. He's so motherfucking cheery he makes Burl Ives seem like Michael Gira.  Still, it's the album's melancholy moment that is its most magic Green's faithful rendering of Joni Mitchell's \"River\", from her 1971 folk masterpiece, Blue. It's barely a Christmas song, a rueful breakup ode that cribs a bit of \"Jingle Bells\". He trades the original's piano for a Wurlitzer and matches Mitchell's mournful alto; a rare moment of restraint that illuminates the span of Green's talent. Coming a mere three songs after a jubilantborderingonspastic version of \"Run Rudolph Run\", it feels like a bit of a hat tip, reminding us that despite all this Christmas ham, the closet freak is still in there somewhere.
