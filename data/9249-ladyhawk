His Vancouverbased quartet Ladyhawk which occasionally enlists the vocal and percussive skills of Black Mountaineers Josh Wells and Amber Webber may have much in common with their betterknown Vancouver peers (namely a love of Neil Young & Crazy Horse's Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, and an aversion to razors), but this isn't a record for getting high; it's for crashing down. You can hear it right there in Driediger's voice: in stark contrast to Stephen McBean's smokering sighs and druganaut jokesterism, Driediger is forthright and at times brutally frank. (Remember this doozy for your next breakup: \"Your looks are fading fast/ So fuck who you will.\") His band doesn't make his barbed sentiments any easier to swallow: Ladyhawk songs are loud but sparse, and seemingly delivered with a pained grimace, as if the players were all suffering from food poisoning. Sevenminute centerpiece \"Long 'Til the Morning\" a nocturnal stoner blues that bears the closest resemblance to the company Ladyhawk keep sets the album's unhurried pace, with a thickfog atmosphere that makes the song's Floydian guitarsolo climax all the more startling. But not all of Ladyhawk's slowmotion workouts employ such effectively dramatic devices: when sequenced together, grungedup invectives like \"Advice\" and \"Sad Eyes/Blue Eyes\" feel sluggish, and make you less inclined to entertain Driediger's postrelationship purging. Fortunately, Ladyhawk work up just enough energy to overcome the lethargy: clapalong pop gallop \"My Old Jacknife\" evokes fellow Vancouverites the New Pornographers if only by osmosis, while \"Teenage Love Song\" plays like a brash, ampedup update of Big Star's \"Thirteen\" (\"Meet me outside the skating rink/ Your mama's a bitch, I don't care what she thinks of me\"). But if Ladyhawk are to soar above Mountains both Black and Pink alike, it'll be because of one song: \"The Dugout\", an openfreeway anthem that, if we are to extend the titular baseball metaphor, is Driediger's first grand slam, and perhaps the most affecting display of sensitiveguy southern rock since Kings of Leon's \"California Waiting\", or even .38 Special's \"Caught Up in You\". This is the song that fans will be hollering for at all Ladyhawk gigs till the end of time their very own \"Freebird\", complete with orgiastic guitar finale (at only a third of the length). Boys, keep swinging. "}
