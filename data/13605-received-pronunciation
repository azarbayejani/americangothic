{"label":" Slumberland","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/14620/homepage_large.49fe45c1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Pants Yell!","title":"Received Pronunciation","text":" Who gives a fuck about Oxford English? Pants Yell! have named their fifth album after, basically, the Queen's accent. If the title of last year's Alison Statton placed the Boston trio in the lessismore lineage of Young Marble Giants, then Received Pronunciation acknowledges what they still more or less are: indie pop formalists, mastering a given dialect rather than inventing unknown tongues. The band's latest does away with the horns and strings of its predecessor, following a bit more conservatively in the tradition of wordy, tuneful, earnest underdogs from Small Factory and the Trashcan Sinatras to the Lucksmiths.What Received Pronunciation loses in variety my kingdom for another \"Two French Sisters\"! it largely makes up for with increasingly accomplished songcraft. Since when has subtlety been supposed to call attention to itself, anyway? You're probably not going to like Received Pronunciation unless you occasionally enjoy breezy, midtempo songs with jangling/shimmering (choose one) rhythm guitar, slinky lead guitar lines, bustling drum fills, warm bass, and shy vocals, but the appeal of Pants Yell! is less about a particular sound than about lyrics and melodies. It also probably helps if you tend to appreciate understated storytelling and unexpected rhymes, though a line like, \"I remember your white sunglasses/ And the way the sun just went right past us,\" is a little more Billy Bragg than Upper West Side soweto.Received Pronunciation won't close you out like new slang; Pants Yell! would rather you make yourself at home, look around the place. First single \"Cold Hands\" sounds more inviting on each listen, with its \"First of the Gang to Die\" bounce, relationship anxiety, and wordplay that works without coming across like its singer needs a pat on the head. Parisian postcard \"Rue de la Paix\" luxuriates in detail, as singer Andrew Churchman declares, \"I remember every little thing.\" But the songs more often show only what's needed: It's up to the listener to puzzle out the hungover unease of measured opener \"Frank and Sandy\"; \"Not Wrong\", in which the narrator admits he can't tie a tie, has to be one of the most peaceful songs ever about getting into a fight. Underneath the polite surfaces is seething comingofage pathos: \"Does that asshole ever tell you that he still thinks of Megan?\" Churchman demands on \"Got to Stop\". The biggest misstep is \"Spider\", a 50second bit of sympathy for the arachnid in winter. You can be too understated.\"What's the point of all this living?\" Churchman sings on accusatory finale \"To Take\", adding, \"Living's all I ever do.\" He has told Swedish magazine Devotion that Received Pronunciation will be the final Pants Yell! album. They want to go the way of Huggy Bear and Felt rather than grow old and predictable. Too bad, because Received Pronunciation isn't my favorite Pants Yell! album, nor the most varied. If a recent Guardian column by critic Simon Reynolds is right, though, and what makes the Beatles, Motown, and great synthpop all immortal is not necessarily revolution, but \"melody and emotion,\" then Pants Yell! definitely have the ingredients to last forever if only for a faithful few who speak their language.
