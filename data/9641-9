Damien Rice is pretty much the vanguard of the avantgarde: a Bladerunnersnazzy digital billboard beckoning toward a brave, new, postemotional future. Sure, the canny Irish artiste may have fooled a lot of people into thinking his ostensible watereddown coffeehouse troubadour shtick was boring enough to win a Shortlist Prize, but a few of us know better. Maybe you're saying I'm full of shit: maybe you can't actually hear the new sound of the 21st century because you're still so busy halflistening to the first 30 seconds of the latest \"leaked\" indie album, breathlessly registering your online approval in comment boxes between ritual visits to goatse.cx. Look, you've heard of the nondenial denial, right? \"I have no recollection of that.\" OK, good, 'cause more recently, the nonapology apology has been sweeping the globe: \"I will apologize to Michael J. Fox, if I am wrong.\" Don't bogart that Vicodin, Mr. Limbaugh. And now Rice, a confessional singer/songwriter, alone in the whole world except for fellow avantgardist and wouldbe author O.J. Simpson, has pioneered the next communications vogue: The nonconfession confession. Simpson's book, If I Did It, has been scuttled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. just days before its expected street date; Rice's sophomore album, 9, is already out and changes everything.  The confessional singer/songwriter's main charge has always been, O tautology of tautologies, to confess. His tales of woe may be tragically real (Elliott Smith) or borne out of a selfmythologized folkie past (early Bob Dylan), but the brokenheartonbloodiedsleeve breed of performer exists to make you feel his pain, babe. Still, no professional fink has ever been so explicit as to begin a record with a song called \"9 Crimes\" nor ever kept so fuzzy about what those crimes actually are. Yes, on 9, Rice makes a lot of mellow noise about being a liar, a cheat, and an allaround gloomy Gus, but his disclosures are usually too trite, his offenses too vague, ever to really ring true, and the songs' assemblyline construction subverts any emotional impact. It's as if Rice has conjured up every clich√© from the genre's past, only to immolate them all in a tepid MOR bonfire. Far fucking out.  A somber duet with band member Lisa Hannigan, \"9 Crimes\" doesn't just conveniently explain the album's title. It also introduces Rice's bland template: First, intone a few faded metaphors so unrelentingly bleak they must be sincere; rotate through a few ghostly arpeggios, either on piano or acoustic guitar (every few songs, actually strum!); build from faltering Jeff Buckley whispers to cathartic Jeff Buckley caterwauls; let the strings swell, and...Congratulations, you're on satellite radio. Rice murmurs, \"It's a small crime, and I got no excuse,\" then adds something about a loaded gun. First time I heard this was in a movie theater before Borat. Trivia: Russell Crowe's prestardom nom de rock was, oh man, Russ Le Roq!  No bears in ice cream vans here. Rice mostly keeps this Lexus LS 400 in cruise control. Oh, occasionally he'll wax meta from \"You asked me to write you a pleasant song\" to \"What's the point of this song?\" in just two tracks and sometimes he gets deep: \"Nothing is lost/ It is just frozen in frost.\" Mostly, though, he's unremittingly melancholy, making sure never to use the word \"end\" when \"die\" will do. \"9 Crimes\" has already been tapped for Grey's Anatomy, but the closest Rice comes to a future sleeper hit is the laidback \"Dogs\", with an agrammatical, nonrhyming chorus about \"the girl that does yoga/ when we come over\" and an overall sense of Dave Matthewsy lasciviousness. Whenever Rice risks truly touching us emotionally say, when he's asking a former lover, \"Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?\" on \"Accidental Babies\" he undercuts himself with gonowhere melodies and formulaic arrangements.  There are a few times throughout 9 when Rice boldly ignores the fact that his chainready inoffensiveness is a major reason for his appeal (this is called an Elizabeth Berkley). \"I am lately horny,\" Rice bellows on the meandering \"Elephant\" after hissing like Thom Yorke at the end of an old \"Creep\" acoustic version. And that's only the start. With usual soft/loud dynamic, \"Rootless Tree\" drifts from middleaged guitar harmonics (a dozing Keller Williams?) to adolescent alternaangst: \"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,\" goes the lazy chorus, a funhousemirror obliteration of all that was affecting in Ani DiFranco's confessional singer/songwriter standard, \"Untouchable Face\". Rice assaults his coffeehouse milieu aurally, as well as lyrically: With its \"my god!\" squeals and sadistic, quasiarty distortion, \"Me, My Yoke, and I\" is a break from the Rice mold and helped me finally identify with The Passion of the Christ. Forgive him, dudes, for he know not what he do.  Now, OK, you're saying, but didn't Rice actually do all this before on O, the awardwinning 2002 debut that went platinum in Ireland and has soundtracked stateside TV dramas ever since? Not quite. Sure, O was a study in earnestnessbynumbers so unimaginative it could've been selfparody, but it did offer a few resolutely tuneful moments: ubiquitous first single \"The Blower's Daughter\", bedroom cello ember \"Volcano\", or the keening but catchy \"Cannonball\" and its adultalternative remix. Like the Juice's If I Did It, Rice's 9 renders past transgressions merely hypothetical. This album promises nine crimes, but at 10 tracks, it's actually a bargain. Hints, allegations, and things left unsaid.  "}
