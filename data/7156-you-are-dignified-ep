{"label":" Touch and Go","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/7044/homepage_large.74336718.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By William Bowers","artist":"Silkworm","title":"You Are Dignified EP","text":" The acoustic guitar is due a reinvention, if only to stave us musictypists off of lazily referring to plinked projects as \"porchy.\" Yes, it sucks that anyone strumming on their stoop is fair game to be mocked by some ahole in a Talon (\"Dude! 'Every Rose Has Its Thorn'! Thass tight!'), but even You Are Dignified, the new tonefrisbee from one of the most enduring loud jumblerock bands, reeks of, you know, screen doors and skeeter carcasses. The acousticequalsporchiness stigma is, reckon, a result of the weird arc fabricated by the prominence of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, an arc that runs through Guthrie's populist sloganry, through Dylan's selfconsciously throwbackian Basement Tapes, and through the work of sundry ensembles with either \"Brothers\" or \"Family\" in their name (Palace, Pernice, Radar, Danielson, Handsome, etc.). Rather than cover a bunch of traditionals, or garnish modern classics as Crooked Fingers did on Reservoir Songs, Silkworm's divaless trio descended into Tim Midgett's basement and belted out five tracks by their pals (two by their Touch and Go labelmates, the canny synergists; students of balneology will find a whole lot of backsidewashing going on). Given the tiki treatment, Shellac's \"Prayer to God\", that almost inhumane chestnut about double homicide (\"Just kill him/ Fucking kill him/ Kill him already, kill him\") fits perfectly into the lineage of country death songs rooted in that Smithsonian thing (especially volume four, on Revenant Records), leaving a bloodtrail through Johnny Cash's catalog, through the Violent Femmes' overt \"Country Death Song\", through Will Oldham's eerie (Albinirecorded) \"A Sucker's Evening (\"I'll hold his arms, you fuck him/ Fuck him with something/ The fuck... he deserves it\"). Fans of these murder ballads should consult Robert Browning's chilling (and ahem, Monsieur Farrar, songworthy) poem \"Porphyria's Lover\", in which the killer holds his strangled woman in his lap, marveling at how \"God has not said a word.\" Wait, Farrar already did the old standby \"Lilli Schull\" (\"She begged me not to kill her,\" \"The fire where I burned her\"). \"And Then\" was a prototype Bside version of Pavement's \"The Hexx\", from their swan miscarriage Terror Twilight (Silkworm's cover was previously released on the Pave tribute Everything Is Ending Here). The 'Worm deserves kudos for lending a rugged staidness to the song that even sinceremode Malkmus can't muster. This track wanders as close to GnR's \"Patience\" as this EP dares; dig Andy Cohen's accomplished, plangent mandolin stylings (though he plays it much more Malkmusly at the end of this disc). Your enjoyment of the Bedhead reworking (of the Albinirecorded \"Lepidoptera\") might teeter on your appraisal of Bedhead (Mine? They're overrated and their best recording is their cover of Cher's \"Believe\"). Interestingly, Silkworm force the original's buried vox to the forefront, over an arrangement that at times almost falls silent (remember, this is a band whose electric solos often sound like byproducts of dares). Shame the lyrics are hitandmissandmiss, but the mandolin breakdown will soothe those still mourning Lullaby for the Working Class's metamorphosis into Mayday, of Emomaha's Saddle Creek imprint. Albini client Robbie Fulks' \"Let's Kill Saturday Night\" is a catchy downandout rabblerouser that transcends all John Bon Cougar JoviMellencamp wannabes, and Silkworm was wise to strip the \"rock\" version to its tuneful, flannelflagwaving essentials, but come on, these \"lousy job\" anthems could be generated by a computer program (call it Cracker). Cohen's mandolin rules this EP's rendition of Nina Nastasia's (yup, Albinirecorded) \"That's All There Is\", seducing the song out of its stolid sparsity and onto a rickety, candlestained (I'm sorry) porch. This EP succeeds as an insidery, and even loving, tossoff, but leaves one halfwishing for a new song, or a bareassed treatment of a Silkworm classic, or at least some drums. Completists should pursue their cover of The Faces' \"Ooh La La\" on Lifestyle and the rocked \"The Chain\" on the singles comp Even a Blind Chicken Finds a Kernel of Corn Now and Then. Bless this band's hearts for never falling into a leadership vacuum. "}
