Deusner","artist":"Meredith Bragg and The Terminals","title":"Vol. 1","text":" I hear the ghost of Elliott Smith haunting Meredith Bragg's debut especially on \"Work and Winter\", where the semblance is uncanny. Over a gently strummed guitar and gently tapped triangle, the former Speedwell member arcs his whispery voice across a plaintive melody, enunciating higher notes for a lyrical phrase before descending again to a more comfortable range. Singing just above his natural level, Bragg crafts the tune and the performance for maximum poignancy. It's the work of a bright student: a little selfconscious and overeager, but nevertheless affecting. On the other hand, the lyrics on \"Work and Winter\" are particularly Gibbardesque: \"Smiling as I felt your breathing align/ In alliance with mine.\" It would be a little rash to dismiss Bragg and his Terminals as just another troupe of popsensitive, heartonsleeve folkies. Admittedly, most of Vol. 1 draws heavily from obvious sources, and most of the ideas here will be familiar to anyone who's heard Nick Drake, Death Cab for Cutie, or the New Year. And yes, the album's aesthetic of failure its tendency toward extreme selfreckoning derives from Smith's canon of introverted and expressive songs. However, despite these influences and even despite its Decemberistical album art, Vol. 1 transcends any accusation of imitation: These 11 tracks have their own high stakes and dire consequences and seem as specific to Bragg himself as Smith's were to him, as Gibbard's are to him. Instead of mining Smith's sense of selfcompromise or entertaining the DCFC frontman's romantic whimsy, Bragg writes lyrics that are more plainspoken and austere in their jadedness. He's wary of relationships on the barebones \"Early Sign\", surprised that he can be guardedly hopeful on \"Carolina\", and, over uncorrected guitar flubs, sweetly reminiscent on \"Seventeen\". All of this introspection is couched in music that is at once intimate yet expansive, concise yet darkly atmospheric, understated yet occasionally powerful. Bragg sings in a soft voice, carefully enunciating his syllables as if uncertain he'll be understood. Only when he alters his voice for \"Waltz No. 1\" does the album falter, but elsewhere his risks pay off. Bragg spends half of the sevenandahalfminute \"I Won't Let You Down\" halfhumming the short melody over and over, stoically building to something uncertain yet ineluctable.  That \"I Won't Let You Down\" sounds so confident and immediate is not just to Bragg's credit, but also to the credit of the Terminals, who prevent Vol. 1 from descending gravitationally into dreariness. Jonathan Roth's drums propel the melodies and anchor Bragg to the world, while Elizabeth Olson's cello adds tremulous gravity to tracks like the short \"Before the Storm\" and \"Bitter at Best\". But it's Brian Minter who adds most to the band's sound and helps make it distinct from their forebears. His piano makes a perfect foil for Bragg's mechanistic guitar rhythms on the propulsive closer, \"Shattering\", and his \"Vibraphonic Devices\" evoke a noir chiaroscuro on the dark \"My Own Worst Enemy\". Bragg and the Terminals may not have pioneered their sound, but they sound perfectly at home all the same. "}
