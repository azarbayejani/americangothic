The \"office\" in that scenario was the Corduroy Records vinyl pressing plant in Australia. The story's captured on their first song, 2003's \"So Many Things\", a track with ragged, propulsive energy; a juvenile sense of humor; sloppy vocals; and a loud, meandering organ. It sounds like the sort of inthemoment jam that could pop up at any work party people have clearly been drinking; the lyrics are frontman Brendan Suppression's bitter rambling about a woman: \"I think about you here and there/ Only because you're a dickhead\" and \"I don't need your boobies/ I don't need your cute little bum.\" It's a rough artifact of their first foray in making music. It's also the opening track on the band's new Gonerimprinted singles compilation, which naturally teases out ECSR's chronological trajectory through Bsides and singles. Since So Many Things shows the group from its inception to the present, it's safe to assume it illustrates some sort of growth. A quick comparison between tracks one and 22 suggest that's probably the case: 2010's \"Rush to Relax\" has markedly better production and displays a bit more patience and maturity in the band. And, throughout the collection, you can hear a more welldefined guitar sound from Eddy Current and more assertive vocals from Suppression. But they never stop having fun their sloppy cover of the GoGo's \"We Got the Beat\" from a 2011 Record Store Day split 7\" on Trouble in Mind proves that. The band sounds reckless in their approach, singing completely off beat (pun probably intended), like they're having just as much fun as they were at the 2003 Corduroy Christmas party. That's probably the best thing about So Many Things it's a document of four dudes having a good time over the course of about six years. Of course, it's not all drunken staggering through silly jams there's plenty of ripping punk and reasonably weighty stuff here. \"You Let Me Be Honest With You\", from their 2008 LPÂ Primary Colours, has a twoguitar barrage, undercut by Suppression's monotonous vocals. In several songs especially \"Honest\" and \"It Ain't Cheap\" his voice sounds a lot like Iggy Pop's on early Stooges records. They've got a cover of \"T.A.L.O.I.G.A.\" by Australian punks the Chosen Few, which has Current attacking a dissonant, screaming guitar solo. Then there's \"Iraq (It's on the Map)\", driven by a militaristic snare and that states, matteroffactly, \"people are dying from west to east.\" Their bass gets guttural and their guitars get frantic on \"Demon's Demands\". They do menace well, something that probably comes from the band's obsession with punk. (Also, drummer Danny Current used to be in a grindcore band called Demonother.) But even when they crank up the distortion, they don't stray too far from their biggest strength these guys really are a lot of fun. \"Hey Mum\" is especially awesome a twominute, jumpy, hokey Hallmark card to a mother. The best part about it? It's still a damn fine punk song. Their growth is most apparent, though, in their musicianship. Even on the shortest song of the bunch, \"Through the Trees\", there's subtle, intricate guitar work from Current that weaves between a harmony line and staying in unison with Suppression's vocals. Sure, Eddy Current Suppression Ring are still the goofy drunks from the record plant, but as musicians, they're capable of elegant, well done rock'n'roll. "}
