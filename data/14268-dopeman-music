Both 2007's MADE and 2008's Emeritus were almost alarmingly bleak mournful, embittered dispatches from a selfimposed exile and spending time in them was rewarding and exhausting in equal measure. Each was also branded Scarface's Retirement Record, but these weren't glitzy Hovstyle sendoffs; they were \"alone in a motel with a bottle of Jack and a gun\" sorts of situations.It's a relief, then, to hear him rapping again with Dopeman Music, and it's even more gratifying to find him limber and energized. Scarface is calling Dopeman Music a mixtape, a runup to his forthcoming studio album, tentatively titled Under Oath, and maybe because of the lowered profile, he seems looser and more engaged with the world. The beats are hardhitting pieces of blaxploitation soul, and Scarface barrels his bigshouldered way through them with vigor. Outside of two unknown Face Mob compatriots B. James and Monk Kaza, who keep pace with their mentor impressively there are no guest rappers. But there is a palpable sense of the light being let in; Scarface calls out fellow Houston vets ZRo and KRino, yes, but also finds time to namecheck Ludacris. T.I., Wayne, and Kanye West (turns out that Scarface is an 808s & Heartbreaks fan). Hell, there are even a few skits here and they're sort of funny!\"Reengaged,\" of course, doesn't equal \"lighthearted.\" As ever, Scarface deals in weighty stuff: pain, loneliness, remorse, injustice. Always a bracingly economical writer, he freezeframes systemic racism with just five words on \"The N Word\": \"White judge, black court reporter.\" He's thoroughly unconvinced anything in this regard has changed: \"Bottom line is, I'm a black man, so my SKIN/ Is my SIN,\" he raps wearily on \"The Ghetto Report\". Scarface has never been much a ladies' man; one of the few songs addressing women on MADE was bluntly called \"Go\", and here, \"Get Lost\" offers basically the same sentiment. He can sometimes sound crushed under the weight of his misanthropy, but here he comes off as oddly sanguine. \"Yeah, I made a little money, but it's gone now,\" he sighs on \"Lyrical Assault\", not sounding particularly perturbed. He throws some good vibes to his former bandmates Willie D and Bushwick Bill later on the same song: \"A Geto Boy till the end, got the plaques to prove it/ Out the group, but I still blast the music.\"Even his death threats, which are usually bloodfreezingly direct, are more playful than usual: \"You'll burn in your Isuzu/ Pussy, you booboo/ Now boohoo and beg for mercy/ Start prayin, cuz if it's Heaven tell the Lord them boys dirty,\" he taunts on \"Wanted\". Dopeman Music is definitely a modest affair, slighter and more straightforward than Face's albums. But he sounds unmistakably rejuvenated, and if it took a oneoff mixtape to reconnect Scarface to his love of making music, than maybe he should make more mixtapes. "}
