With its discarded trees, glacial lines of benevolent givers at returns and exchanges counters at every shop in the temple, and the beginning of the final week before New Year's six days to reflect upon how much you aged and how little you accomplished  somehow \"Boxing Day\" just doesn't cut it. Until Hallmark designates that day of peace and anticlimax, Parisian \"mutant disco\" label ZE offers two fitting carols from ZE Xmas Record Reloaded 2004, a record on which the resurrected label continues reissuing its Reaganera backlog of \"no wave\" and avantdisco comps by throwing together its various Xmas Records into one disc. Was (Not Was)'s \"Christmas Time in Motor City\" only sees holiday joy on the Rudolph and snowman paper cutouts tacked above the window for the welfare office. \"I can't even remember seeing Santa Claus!\" they grouppout to a Funkadelic metalstrut. Yet one bandmate vaguely recalls seeing St. Nick in the unemployment line, and queuing for soup at a shelter that'll 86 him for visiting too many times. Midway through the track, a poet interrupts and reminisces about spending his Christmas feeding pigeons and watching traffic mosey by while hearing \"Silent Night\" on a donut shop radio. This routine of feeling ostracized from the Somebodies also drives Alan Vega's gothic R&B; ballad, \"No More Christmas Blues\". The Suicide frontman perfectly exhales his undead Elvis persona, whimpering and mumbling like an alleyway drunk aglow with red and green Times Square neon: \"This year is going to be different/ I ain't going to be so broke/ I'm going to smile, smile and smile\". Many of the artists here either attempt to pay the bills with easy listening AOR jingles or pout in a corner. Guess which songs make this record worthwhile to buy in July? On \"Things Fall Apart\", Cristina reminisces about broken Christmas tree angels, absentee boyfriends, and parties where nobody knew her name. \"I went back to my flat and wept a bit and fed my cat,\" she concludes over queasy new wave chords. Giving that glum premise a Cathy touch is the Waitresses' \"Christmas Wrapping\". Here, Patty Donahue of \"I Know What Boys Like\" 15minute fame delivers a dry, schmaltzy reciting of her Christmas letters of \"low and behold\" moments. No Wave tweeker icon James White is a complete bastid as his \"Christmas with Satan\" attests. He imagines hell as the perfect escape from the Christmas hype with a brass section that parodies classic carols and Jewish folk songs with a mouth full of bile and bourbon. White's mockery is a relief after so much AOR dreck on ZE Xmas. I'll keep it short and painless: synthfunk that bends its knees to look funky at an office party (Lisi's \"My Silent Night\"); a Brian Wilson homage at Disneyland (Miss OD & Gentlemen League's \"Bells of Christmas\"); autopilot cheer for when you open your creditcard bills (Lio, Helena Noguerra & Marie France's \"Sleigh Ride\"); and John Denver's muppet ghost (Davitt Sigerson's \"It's a Big Country\").
