That appears to be the case with London fivepiece Fields, whose inaugural EP deals in the sort of hazy but heartfelt jangly guitar pop that, since the mid1980s, the Brits have been wont to classify as \"indie,\" but which, over here in North America circa 2006, has come to mean \"Zach Braff pantyremover soundtrack.\" Which is to say 7 From the Village boasts all the hallmarks of contemporary, music supervisorfriendly collegiate pop: it's urgent but never antagonistic, distorted but not abrasively so, lyrically oblique but emotionally obvious. However, judging by the recent North American tour that brought them to CMJ, Fields have now amplified their languid lullabies into Musesized melodramas, drowning out frontman Nick Peill's acousticguitar guidance with whitenoise squalls, and promoting keyboardist/background vocalist Thorun Antonia to spotlightseizing diva. I'm assuming this sort of effectspedaltothemetal attack is what we can expect from Fields' upcoming fulllength album, produced by altrock heavyweight Michael Beinhorn (Soundgarden, Soul Asylum), but it'd be a shame if the more winsome Fields heard on 7 From the Village was completely mowed over in the process.  You can already see the writing on the wall with the opening \"Song for the Fields\", which begins with two minutes of Peill's soloacoustic tension buildup before the drums trigger a rockedout, strobelitready finale. But the plaintive pair of \"Isabel\" and \"Brittlesticks\" show that the band's real strengths are in the subtleties: Peill and Antonia's blurred unisex harmonies; the slideguitar sweeps and glockenspiel chimes that cut through the synthsaturated fuzz; and the acoustic strums that give the songs a spirited momentum even when the drum tracks get muffled by the dense mix. And though these songs seem destined to earn the band a Snow Patrolsized paycheck, 7 From the Village's best track, \"Sisters\", is its most anomalous: an eerie, Wicker Manworthy paganfolk paean that transforms midway into a raga raveup, goaded on by strange synth squeals and haunting subliminal chants that hearken back to the early promise of the Beta Band's Three EPs. While Fields' current live set trades in village vernaculars for bigcity bombast, let's hope that in their quest for hits, the band doesn't lose their connection to the huts.  "}
