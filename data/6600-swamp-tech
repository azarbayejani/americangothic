Although casting around a little, I see that some of us already have. Needlessly, too there are plenty of sensible things to say about Quintron's latest without attaching some risenfromtheashes narrative to it. We could talk about how Swamp Tech is, upon close examination, utterly befuddling an adjectivebusting blend of electroclash 'tude, the White Stripes's reconstructed authenticity, X's skullpiercing organs, LCD thump, Electric 6's heavyhanded satire, the Frogs's transgressive mugging, Le Tigre's ravealong skate rink jams, gospel conviction and N'awlins bayou boogie, circuitbent acid house squelch, et al. But at a reasonable distance, the album's mechanics are much simpler nasty, chickenfried electro grooves squirm and squiggle through a pep rally of stupid/funny chantalongs. By now Quintron's done with the disjunctive, percussionheavy gear tests that informed his earlier albums; no longer needing to push the limits of his invented lighttriggered percussion, he's focusing on playing polished, energetically affable songs. Dumb fun trumps brainy tedium, and if Swamp Tech were an RPG, it'd be all whimsical minigames, no arduous statbuilding. Sometimes, the lyrical absurdity approaches zenkoan levels of sublimity, as on the nervous metallic jangle of the brief \"Squirrel Gardens\": \"Squirrel Gardens is full of squirrels,\" deadpans Miss Pussycat. \"But there is someone who does not belong there who is there/ It is an eel that dresses like a squirrel.\" That shit is pretty heavy. But mostly, we get exuberant brattiness. \"I am a badass,\" Quintron and Pussycat callandresponse over the gristly pulse of \"Swamp Buggy Badass\", right after what sounds like a bong hit starting like a lawn mower. The lunging organ vamp \"French Quarter Faggot\" finds Quintron in selflacerating mode: \"I am a French Quarter faggot motherfucker/ I like the sound of electroclash,\" his voice dropping into an appropriately ghoulish lower register on the last word. \"Fly Like a Rat\" appropriates \"The Jeffersons\" theme into its splashy electro muskrat love, and \"Witch in the Club\" is an electrified dance floor with soaring organ shunts. It's raw, raucous and gyroscopic, recorded live to twotrack with Quintron running his organ through a bass cabinet for that fatbottomed, buzzing sound. Swamp Tech is strictly partyandbullshit, if the modifiedfororgan cover of Kiss's \"God of Thunder\" didn't already tip you off.  "}
