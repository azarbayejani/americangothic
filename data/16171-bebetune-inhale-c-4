Far Side Virtual, a worldbuilding record of Windows startup screen sounds signifying something about worldwide web convenience and Western cluelessness, landed at the top of The Wire's \"Records of the Year\" list. So polarizing was its placement though, that editorinchief Tony Herrington felt obligated to crunch the numbers. I thought the album was pretty good. It's charming at times, and conceptually solid, so there isn't much to fault it for, unless you want to declare the entire conceit complete bullshit, which some have understandably done. \"Remember when you were a little kid dicking with your first Casio for 45 minutes?\" music critic Christopher Weingarten tweeted, \"James Ferraro does that onstage as a grown man.\" Far Side Virtual also seemed criticproof, which was frustrating. If you praised it, well, you were hip to its heady concept, though backed into such a corner that soon enough it may philosophically force you to give \"Best New Track\" to your iPhone's default ringtone. Negative reviews could be dismissed as the listener's simply not getting the joke. Ferraro helped moderate reactions as well. Previously a mystery man without an email address and just a few interviews here and there (and a much noisier, more interesting sound), he went public, doing critics' heavy lifting himself by explicating the album's intentions to Elle, The Quietus, and many others. The guy went viral. He trolled his way into the music conversation. And just as Far Side Virtual inexplicably arrived on yearend lists, he put out a more obnoxious release: The free, victorylap mixtape under the name Bebetune$. Inhale C4 $$$$$ finds Ferraro developing a mutant strain of mainstream rap and R&B. AutoTune is mimicked, the skittering snares of radio rap show up, and there's special attention paid to the sloppy mastering and obnoxious DJ drops common on mixtapes. It turns out however, that hiphop actually takes some finesse and knowledge to recreate and Ferraro just doesn't have the skills. \"Maccau Celebrities\" cribs its melody from TPain and Lil Wayne's \"Can't Believe It\", and though it captures the sound of Wayne's syrupdrunk croons, there's no emotive charm. \"#GRINDLYFE\" has some of the demonic guitarcrunch grandiosity of Flockaveli but does nothing with it, and \"H20\" squiggles around like a Timbaland ripoff. Then there's \"Street Dream$$\", a failed attempt at giving Gang Gang Dance's \"Glass Jar\" the sampleslicing, drum pattern piling, AraabMuzik treatment. It features hihats and handclaps, an airhorn, a dripping water sound, and some Drakelike AutoTune and it's a mess. Perhaps that's the point, though? \"Street Dream$$\" begins with \"I can hear everything. It's everything time,\" from \"Glass Jar\". It's a quote Ferraro has discussed before. In his interview with The Quietus, he compared the phrase to Nike's \"just do it,\" recommending GGD sell the phrase to Google. It's contemporary rap however, the sound Ferraro is either poorly approximating or lazily mocking, that truly embodies \"It's everything time.\" Hiphop has embraced \"the cloud\" like no other genre, pouring MP3s onto the internet with little interest in how they fit onto an 80minute CD, running a flowering, free internet industry right alongside the desiccated majorlabel album landscape. Instead of celebrating rap's industrybucking impulse, Ferraro misreads the signs and signifiers of the mixtape world as amateurism. DJ and producer tags echoing around in the background of rap tracks not only serve a pragmatic function in an era of no liner notes, telling you who produced a track or put together the album, but add some chaos that can skyrocket an already awesome song onto another plateau. They're part of the fun. In a 2010 interview with HipHop Game, AraabMuzik explained his aesthetic choices: \"I never sampled off vinyl. I've always been digital with it. Mp3 quality. I'm not really with the cracks and the oldsounding, rough, ruggedtype sound... I'm with the clear, quality sound.\" See, hiphop's tinny, digitized scream isn't a mistake it's a modern update of the golden era's warm, analog hiss. Whether it's mainstream hitmaker Lex Luger and his snarling traprap maximalism, or the gossamer, stonedout electronica of internet beatmakers like the Block Beattaz and Clams Casino, it should occur to Ferraro that he's got a lot in common with rap's creative types. Or maybe he's aware of that and just has a snarky way of showing it. Because the tracks here feel endless, like uninspired, snarky parodies of rap instrumentals, roving along for too long, filled with too many recycled ideas and yet, not one worth considering. "}
