{"label":" DFA","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/2016/homepage_large.7a15fc8c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nick Sylvester","artist":"Various Artists","title":"DFA Compilation #2","text":" Here's a joke: Black Leotard Front's maggotbrained \"Casual Friday\" kickstarts the DFA Compilation #2 with a blast of pink streamers, mutant glitter, and a series of GainsbourgDoesFrankfurt whatnots whose sex quotient, to piggish ears, rivals the breathiest, most fecal shitporn yelp. The Greatest Peep Show Ever then keeps on peeping for about 40 more seconds, when suddenly all three members of this discofuck troupe start chanting, \"Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!\" like they're on \"Sesame Street\". It's the audio equivalent of, say, the MILF Hunter going offcamera midhunt and putting on Groucho Marx glasses and a Dr. Seuss Cat hat before coming back and expecting us to pick up where we left off. Around that song's threeminute mark, Black Leotard Front play their cheapest, dirtiest trick, offering up ad nauseam a clumsy English translation of the song's Vorwort, replacing the original's selfinvolved whispers with militant matters of fact: \"I was leaving the office.\" \"I took off my dress.\" \"I put on my overcoat to surprise you in the flesh.\" By this point, \"Casual Friday\" is barely a fifth of the way through its 15minute runtime, the threedisc DFA Compilation #2 has hardly even started, and there we are, pants around ankles and red in the kisser. If this review was Uncle Milty, it would raise its palms and smirk. \"Casual Friday\" sums up DFA Records circa 2004 with startling accuracy. The qualities that have typically characterized the label rapt attention to genre, an implicit skepticism of easy and less songy dance music, a subtle sense of humor continue to crystallize as a slew of new additions (sound engineers Delia & Gavin and the aforementioned Black Leotard Front, J.O.Y., Pixeltan, Liquid Liquid) expand and diversify its often pigeonholed roster. These guys actually do give a shit, all the way down to the packaging and sequencing of Compilation #2, which collects the DFA's vinylonly releases from this year and more than a few compilationonly exclusives. What could have been a mere anthology of the label's uniformly excellent 2004 output is, additionally, a meticulously assembled personal narrative. This is a label that balances its musical and commercial aspirations with an earthy, nobullshit disposition and let's say it the world's best fucking handclaps. Tracks like the lanky \"Casual Friday\", Pixeltan's subbass masterpiece \"Get Up/Say What (DFA Remix)\", and LCD Soundsystem's still unspeakably great \"Yeah\" are 10minute dance songs with beginnings, middles, and ends; people who complain about the downtime on \"Get Up\" or the crass acid freakout finale of \"Yeah\" completely miss the point. Delia & Gavin's Gottschingkind \"El Monte\" and the DFA remix of \"Rise\" are even more expansive, as patterns settle in and flesh out before the next move is made, a bravado afforded to only the most tightlywound loops. The DFA's remix of J.O.Y.'s \"Sunplus\" wins the label's \"Most Bizarre Release Award\" the reception to it has been mixed, and for many people this is the first DFA release they haven't liked but it's also possibly their most important record. James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy have worked on several unlikely acts at this point N.E.R.D. and \"She Wants To Move\" come to mind but in truth their highcarb basslines and unclamped hihats were making them fat, and it's about time they went on a diet. Like it or not and I like it their Slitsy, minimal \"Sunplus\" remix speaks to the team's crucial ability to change and stay the same all at once: Their malleability is on perfect display here. The label boasts further variety with Juan MacLean's crooked riddim \"Dance Hall Modulator Dub\" and Liquid Liquid's rerecording of \"Bellhead\". On the latter, Murphy and Goldsworthy admirably keep low profiles in the face of such personally influential living legends, merely trading the original's trashcan reverb for crisp percussion and about twenty more BPM. Old reliables (The Rapture's previously UKonly \"Alabama Sunshine\" and a dub mix of \"Sister Savior\"; a fine drone remix of Black Dice's touronly single \"Wastered\", fittingly renamed \"Wasteder\"); and old favorites (LCD Soundsystem's \"Beat Connection\"; Eye's remix of Black Dice's \"Endless Happiness\") fill out the rest of this musical annal, most notably touching upon The Rapture's departure from the DFA. Bygones are indeed bygones, though, and if anyone's really upset about that rift, the third disc of Compilation #2 is a topnotch party mix with get this actual mixing. Along with Beats In Space's Tim Sweeney, Tim Goldsworthy outdoes himself on practically every track transition: Jittery percussive swells on \"Bellhead\" creep early into \"Echoes\" and energize the song's descending figures; the cowbells and clean squeaks of \"Sunplus\" martial the beatless \"El Monte\" and reach through all the way into the beginning of Juan MacLean's \"Give Me Every Little Thing\"; and at the end, \"Beat Connection\" fights with \"Yeah\" for volume, until both of them play together at fullblast. In a word, it's glorious, a fitting oldmeetsnew, tongueincheek gesture to conclude one of 2004's most worthwhile tales.Â  "}
