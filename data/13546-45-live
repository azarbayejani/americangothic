There's a number of reasons it's been a 12\" genre from the getgo, even as running times shrank from the 14plusminute marathon of the original \"Rapper's Delight\" to the threeandchange of \"Sucker MC's\" the most prominent being that 45s are an absolute bastard to cut and mix. When DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist did it during their Hard Sell tour a couple years back, they preceded the show with a goofy little introductory fauxindustrial short that highlighted all the pitfalls of DJing with 7\" records: less surface space to work with, the looseness of centerhole adapters, and a faster speed to try and keep up with.Now take into account the fact that Peanut Butter Wolf actually went and made 7\" edits of 18 different tracks ranging from the dawn of hiphop to the peak of its late1980s golden age. PBW's messed around with hiphop on 45 before, most prominently on 2007's Yo! 45 Raps mix, but to deliberately hack down oldschool hophop classics to bitesized individual servings seems like kind of a weird redundancy. The vinyl version did at least result in an interesting collector's item a stack of newlypressed 45s of these edits, stacked inside a PiLstyle circular metal box and sold through Stones Throw's site yet is there really any benefit to hearing your favorite hiphop classics, but shorter?As it turns out, there damn well is at least if they're mixed. The vinyl box set's an interesting curio, but the CD version's where the real goldmine is. By now it should go without saying that PBW's one of those heads who talks cratedigging but walks DJing, and his skills make 45 Live a perfectly sequenced, smartlypaced and sharplycut love letter to hip hop across the 80s. Its 49ish minutes are bookended with a couple of canonical favorites: Fearless Four's Kraftwerkappropriating 1982 electrorap classic \"Rockin' It\" begins the mix, and it's closed out by BDP's deathless \"The Bridge Is Over\", with its intro chopped and spun back so it sounds as if he's playing that breakbeat/piano loop like a yoyo. And between those two tracks is a familiar but momentumfilled rundown of hiphop's first decade of evolution.The oldschoolheavy early minutes of the mix are maybe the most intriguing, considering that the first seven tracks about 40 minutes' worth of music in their original form are cut down to less than half of their total running time, resulting in a crash course in how electrifying and strange preRunDMC hiphop could be. The first three tracks set a strong precedent with the \"Man Machine\"sourced Fearless Four opener, the minimalist percussiononly funk of Spoonie Gee's \"Love Rap\", and the burbling discodub cut \"Tricky Tee Rap\" (whose titular MC, the liner notes observe, sounds kind of like current Common). There's even a ringer: Busy Bee's hilarious, \"Apache\"sampling cursewordfakeout track \"Old School\" is a straightup throwback, recorded in 1988 and made to sound a decade older.The transition from old school to early golden age is represented with a onetwo that sets the pace for the rest of the mix: \"Sucker D.J.'s (I Will Survive)\", Dimples D's Marley Marlproduced response to RunDMC, and T La Rock's Def Jamchristening lyrical watershed \"It's Yours\". From there on out it's a succession of greatness, heavy on Juice Crew material (\"Make the Music With Your Mouth, Biz\"; \"Marley Marl Scratch\"; Big Daddy Kane's \"Just Rhymin' With Biz\"), vintage headknock (JVC Force's \"Strong Island\"; JustIce's \"Cold Gettin' Dumb\") and a twofer of lyrical party rap that extends outside the five boroughs to Philadelphia (Cash Money & Marvelous' \"Mighty Hard Rocker\") and New Haven (Stezo's \"It's My Turn\").So maybe the format isn't the real point it's the trip down memory lane that counts. 45 Live isn't just a historical look, but a personal one, too; PBW's liner notes outline all kinds of observations regarding coming of age listening to hiphop across the country from where these singles were recorded (\"I remember when KRS first came out, I was such an MC Shan fan, yet KRS was so dope, it really messed me up\"), and he goes on the kinds of enthusiastic tangents you get only from the deeply committed. It's easy to look at the tracklisting, see the roster of wellloved oldschool singles and shrug at its familiarity, even if it's still a treat to listen to all over again. But Peanut Butter Wolf didn't just have memories of his younger self's education in mind when he assembled 45 Live this mix is put together in a way that makes it an ideal introduction to vintage rap for kids who are currently the same age he was when they first came out.
