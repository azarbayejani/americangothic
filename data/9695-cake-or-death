{"label":" BPX1992","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/9523/homepage_large.71c2103b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stephen Troussé","artist":"Lee Hazlewood","title":"Cake or Death","text":" The trailer single in advance of Cake or Death Lee Hazlewood's angry, silly, funny, ultimately unbearably poignant valedictory album is \"Baghdad Knights\", an account of the Iraq fiasco told from the perspective of the U.S. marines. \"Sometimes we fight, sometimes we run,\" he croaks in that oldman deadpan he perfected as a youth, \"It's just like playing football.../ With a gun\". The song is driven by a crackling livewire guitar riff, which just happens to have fallen off the back of Howlin' Wolf's \"Smokestack Lightnin'\". It's a timely tip of the hat, since Hazlewood's picaresque adventure through postwar American pop really hit paydirt exactly 50 years ago, when guitarist Al Casey (who's all over the new record) applied his approximation of that very riff to Hazlewood's unassuming country number, \"The Fool\", then gave it to Sanford Casey to take to No. 7 in the Billboard charts in August 1956. \"The Fool\" was Hazlewood's first hit, but it bore all the hallmarks of his mature style: a laconic song of lost love, sung by a baleful baritone and recorded just a few blocks down Lonely Street from Heartbreak Hotel, right at the bottom of the Well of Loneliness. With a few cosmetic touches, it became a formula Hazlewood was to take all the way from his indie rock and roll beginnings in mid50s Arizona, on to international success as the cowriter and producer of Duane Eddy, a spell writing hits for Dean Martin, the golden years of screwball pop with Nancy Sinatra, a stint producing her dad and composing movie scores, a pause to help give birth to country rock (via the International Submarine Band, who released their posthumous debut on his LHI label in 1968), before heading off to see the world, and, in particular, Sweden, where he made awardwinning TV shows and hilarious, heartbreaking solo albums throughout the 1970s.Cake or Death could well be Hazlewood's 30th album the discography is a little sketchy but unhappily it's almost certainly his last, since he was diagnosed earlier this year with renal cancer. At such a time it must be tempting to speeddial Rick Rubin, schedule some shots with Anton Corbijn, call in favors from your celebrity buddies, and spiff yourself up as an American Legend, Soberly Confronting Death. But sobriety has never been Hazlewood's style, and Cake or Death is as daffy, cornball and absurdly touching as anything he's put his name to over the last half century. \"Fred Freud\", for starters, is a stringdriven thing that imagines the existence of a smarter Freud Deud one who realises \"no kisses or posies can cure your neuroses\" and so prescribes a course of listening to Bach or Mozart instead. And the extract from \"Some Velvet Morning\" perhaps the most sumptuous, slyly subversive of Hazlewood's pop fantasies is sung here by his 8yearold granddaughter, Phaedra, who naturally supposes the song is about her.  Who could bemoan the guy such indulgence? Especially when he includes a gorgeous version of \"Please Come to Boston\", sung with great gusto by Ann Kristin Hedmark according to Lee, \"the best lady jazz singer in Scandinavia\", and, from the sound of her, apparently from that elusive part of Scandinavia that lies below the MasonDixon line. Or \"It's Nothing to Me\": A version of a hillbilly ballad recorded by Hazlewood protégé Loy Clingman in 1957, here, with a whispered performance set in a lush production from Lasse Samuelsson, sounding like the greatest song Lambchop never recorded.  As \"Baghdad Knights\" suggests, there's also a fair bit of stateofthenation addressing. What can they do now, boycott him? \"Anthem\" is a spirited bluesy strut, a few righteous redneck words from one Texan mockcowboy to another, while \"White People Thing\" provides another outing for that Smokestack riff, accompanying a bitter acknowledgement that America really is a land of milk and honey, providing you're wealthy and white.  But the song that makes the album, and provides the punchline to this peerless pop career is the final song, \"T.O.M. (The Old Man)\". Dedicated to his wife, it's an unbearably poignant update of \"Wonderful World\". \"Have you seen the mountains?\" he wonders in that rueful growl of his, \"They still hug the snow/ And have you seen the Old Man?/ He's ready to go\". All of us who still believe in the promise, beauty, and comedy of popular music should raise a glass to the old man. "}
