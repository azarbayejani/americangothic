Beyond being an easy way for these Vancouver Anglophones to score some Francophone cool, it serves to contemporize an album that both deliberately evokes both in sound and collaborative process early60s Brill Building popsong production, and one whose recording first commenced some five years ago.On top of enumerating the album's formidable 39person guest list, Gigi principals Nick Krgovich (of artpopsters No Kids) and Colin Stewart (producer for Black Mountain, among others) are careful to itemize each track's recording date in the liner notes perhaps to show their efforts coincided with, or even predated, those of softpop peers the Pipettes, Lucky Soul, and Camera Obscura. But then Maintenant feels more an extension of a certain Vancouverbred pop classicism one that dates back to Carl Newman's preNew Pornographers outfit Zumpano on through to the unheralded ensemble Young and Sexy than part of some prevailing, blogbuzzed trend. That regionalist quality manifests itself in the aforementioned supporting cast, which pulls equally from Vancouverscene mainstays (Duffy Driediger of Ladyhawk, Veda Hille) and K Records kin from across the border (Rose Melberg of Tiger Trap/the Softies, Karl Blau, Mirah), plus frequent flyer Owen Pallett.It's essentially Krgovich's version of the 6ths' Wasps' Nest, one where he gets to upgrade his lofi indierock heroes from a Motel 6 to a penthouse at the Hilton but has them sleep alone. Because Gigi understand that the most important periodera sound to capture here isn't a \"Be My Baby\" kickdrum boom or a Bacharachian bossa nova swing (though both are in full effect), but rather the sound of repression of forcing a smile while your heart sinks, of maintaining appearances while you're dying inside.Maintenant's best songs stretch the distance between what is said and how it's expressed, like the way Sydney Vermon and Marissa Johnson's \"I'm Not Coming Out Tonight\" channels its postbreakup desperation into a heavenly orchestral ascension. Liberated from Ladyhawk's anguished grunge, Driediger proves himself a surprisingly gentle crooner on the charming boysdocry serenade \"The Hundredth Time\"; Mirah shows she's game for a Supremesstyle romp on \"Won't Someone Tell Me?\"; and, in the wake of the conceptual intricacy of Heartland, it's a revelation to hear Pallett in affectingly somber pianoballadeer mode on \"I'll Quit\".However, if Gigi wanted Maintenant to truly resemble an early60s artifact, they would've been wise to trim the 15song tracklist to a more periodappropriate 10. For an album that's steeped in anachronistic detail jukeboxes, drives to \"lookout point\" and listening to \"'Mockin' Bird Hill' on the radio'\" the references to club lighting guys and shopping malls on Joey Cook's \"One Woman Show\" feel more 1993 than 63, a quality reinforced by the fact the song sounds a lot like an early Liz Phair track. And beyond this incongruity, there are redundancies; Melberg's \"Alone at the Pier\" pales next to the similarly Spectorized \"No, My Heart Will Go On\"; and in the lonesome Bacharachian ballad department, Katie Eastburn's pofaced \"The Marquee\" can't match the understated camp of Parenthetical Girls frontman Zac Pennington's \"Dreams of Romance\". Still, as a paean to the past, Maintenant sounds right in the here and now because for all their vintage dressing, Gigi are ultimately most interested in the bad romance that makes our present so tense.
