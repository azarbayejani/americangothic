Still, everything's not lost: Made in China will find its audience moody high school girls with jerk boyfriends will listen to this album while scrawling lyrics on their Chucks in multicolored ball points (probably pink). The album's main setback is its schizo\"love in the 90s is paranoid\" philosophyscuffedup \"Sex in the City\" mindset, lusting after problems of girls 10 or 15 years your junior. Hatfield's going on 40 but still stuck in adolescene, complaining, \"I don't want to go to school today/ I just wanna play guitar all day\" on \"Stay Awake\". During \"Digital Penetration\" is this an 'N Sync cover? she protests \"shiny girls with no opinions,\" and parties where everybody knows the words except her; \"Send Money\" has to break some record for most unimpassioned petition for allowance money (albeit from God). But what's she so pissed off about anyway? School hasn't been the root of her problems for years, and while retro stunts do well to remind us of comparatively jaded pseudopunk femme fatales of yesteryear, what's past is past: \"New Waif\" might portend potentially catchy bulimiarock (a 90s Bettie Serveert and Velocity Girl vomitfest, at best) but gets old quick: Hatfield has nothing new to say besides \"You don't know what it's like to be perfect,\" and it might explain her perfectperson tendency toward carelessness guitar solos, grating vocals (remember that time she picked up smoking to make her voice edgier?), overdone crabbiness all signs that point to thinly veiled midlife crisis rock.  But Hatfield doesn't care what we think doesn't care if we buy her records and the halfassedness shows. At best, the inattention doubles up as deeply felt passion; at worst and it's mostly always at worst it's selfinflicted cuts doused in lemon juice. On \"What Do I Care\", she's shocked when we don't sing her praises \"I'm amazed you don't find me delicious/ Look at me, I'm a rock star!\" and we're shocked she can't see why not. "}
