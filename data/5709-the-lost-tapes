{"label":" Columbia / Ill Will","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/5633/homepage_large.1caee62d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Sam Chennault","artist":"Nas","title":"The Lost Tapes","text":" It's not easy being Nas. No matter what the man does, no matter how strong he comes, people still come back with, \"It ain't Illmatic.\" It's an unfair way to judge someone's work, though you can hardly deny that statement's accuracy. After all, the 90s only spawned a handful of other hiphop records that can even be mentioned in the same breath as Nas' 1994 classic. With songs like \"Life's a Bitch\", \"One Love\", and \"N.Y. State of Mind\", and producers like Pete Rock, Primo, and Large Professor, Illmatic not only signified Nas at his nastiest and most poetic, but it also represented the pinnacle of 90s NYC hiphop. The falloff has been a bitch; Nas' sins include releasing what can politely be considered a string of mediocre albums, ghostwriting for Will Smith, and immersing himself in enough beefs to keep a fleet of hiphop gossip columnists busy for years. But, after all these disappointments, we still hold out hope for the return of hiphop's prodigal son. And The Lost Tapes does, on the surface, seem like a possible candidate for that revival. Ostentatiously released for the real headz, this collection features tracks only previously released on mixtapes or over the Internet. Hopefully, this means none of the jiggy, commercialfriendly nonsense that's really dragged down his records the past few years. The album's first track, \"Doo Rags\", finds Nas doing what he does best: reminiscing about his youth in the ghetto over a jazzy, pianobased loop. Nas namechecks Beat Street Breakers and the XClan while railing against \"political thugs in shark suits [who] persuade us to pull triggers.\" At the end of the second verse, he raps, \"Your paper money was the death of Christ/ And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life/ It's like a cycle.\" After the science of \"Doo Rags\", the resurrection of Rakim's only true successor seems like a real possibility. Unfortunately, Nas' return is pretty shortlived. On the next track, \"My Way\", Nas returns to his pimpedout, diamondstuddedglocks persona. He raps, \"Living my life like everyday is my last night/ Alcoholic on toilets I shit blood/ Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug.\" Yeah, okay. But it must be said that Nas does add a little more to the gangsta formula than most. In the second verse of the song, he gives a vivid retelling of the death of his friend Ill Will, whose name Nas has used for his record label, and concedes that he \"still feels broke with millions in the bank.\" The Alchamist (aka PrimoinTraining) provides a nice but somewhat generic beat. Ever the provocateur, Nas does take a couple of shots at his rivals. On \"Purple\", he raps, \"I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers,\" while on \"Everybody's Crazy\", he insults someone by calling them a \"Sisqo fag.\" In \"Black Zombie\", Nas veers back towards black conscious, deriding the media's stereotypes of AfricanAmerican as gangstas and hoes, the inequality in the educational system, and blackonblack violence. After hearing Nas spin gangsta narratives on \"Blaze a 50\" and \"My Way\", and after being subjected to the hype surrounding his long string of selfprovoked beefs, it isn't hard to spot the hypocrisy in these otherwise noble sentiments. But, when you think about it, haven't the boldest and greatest of us been mired in contradictions: Lenin, Bill Clinton, Bob Dylan, Tupac Shakur... So, maybe we can forgive Nas of his moral contradictions. But what's a little harder to swallow are some of the beats on this album. The Barry White sample on \"No Idea's Original\" is nice, but it doesn't fit Nas' flow on the track. And while \"Blaze a 50\" is an interesting narrative involving betrayal, sex, and murder, the generic violinbased track almost ruins it. Despite its flaws, though, The Lost Tapes is nice. Not a return to form, per se, but possibly as close as we're likely to get. Besides, after all the years and disappointments, the expectations for Nas have finally subsided. What I'm saying is, if you can manage to forget Illmatic, you might actually like the guy again. "}
