The Beginners Guide to Understanding the Roots, Vols. 1 & 2","text":" There's not much to understand, really. The only song you really need and, blasphemy!, you're getting this out a Philly cat is \"Push Up Ya Lighter\", from 1996's Illadelph Halflife. The Roots band never came closer to that tightwound, RZAsquared minimalism, and they did it there without compromising their looser jazz/soul/funk sensibilities (check the watery, monkish keyb progression). The Roots worked a few years behind New York's producers in the beginning, but when records like \"Clones\" or \"Concierto of the Desperado\" hit, they made comparable Alc and RZA tracks sound demo. Allmusic loves dropping the Stetsasonic bomb when time comes to squash the ridiculously common \"Roots are the first hiphop band\" belief among those who first saw the Roots at their college SpringFest (same kids on facebook who like \"hiphop for dancing.\") But that doesn't mean live instruments lost their cachet, especially for ingratiating 1990s hiphop to rockies and jazzbos. Remember, too, that the Roots put JayZ in that Unplugged game, and I don't think anybody has taken the time to mine that moment for its musiccultural relevance. And yet as much as they shine musically, Roots MCs Black Thought and to a much lesser extent Malik B struggle with the pen. \"Lighter\" covers all the topics and touchstones: coming to terms with modern hiphop's ragsorriches comeup; repping Philly; repping hiphop's Blackness; loving ladies right. Vaguely conscious, literary insofar as he was a tad sophistic, Black Thought spouts truisms in deft internal rhyme schemes, but after a decade dude still doesn't have a single memorable line, and that's foul. The better Roots mic moments have always been on the guest spots, and lady Bahamadia's work here (\"Inclined to rap about facts, I never fake jacks/ Shit is real like E packs\") recalls past upstagings from Common, Dice Raw, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Cody ChestnuTT, QTip, usw. Pride's a bitch, though. Had this band thought of themselves as producers and made records with different rappers rather than convince themselves of some personal unfuckwithable aesthetic, they could have killed. Home Grown! should kill me on nostalgia alone, but all I can think of is how the Roots refused to back JayZ at Live 8, some snub factor or another, and how in retrospect the only reason I liked them was because they're a band, and at 13 that made it the only rap music I could play in my parents' rapisnotmusic cars. (Hey, that's how Beth and Barry roll.) Otherwise, sorry, the Roots never mustered much consequence musically speaking, this is a completely insular career of mostly great beats and halfrealized rhymes. They have a loyal following the same way Dave Matthews or Pat McGee or moe. have them, and surely their loyal fans picked up all the rarities and unreleased these and those along the way maybe even off that tripledisc bootleg that was on the shelves for a minute this time last year. The rest of you might like to know that the band remixed \"Don't Say Nuthin'\", last year's worst rap single by a kilo, which I take as tacit admission they thought the same. The dub take on neodull song \"Break You Off\" ain't bad, and the live medley of \"The Seed/Melting Pot/The Web\" has this nasty snareonquarters backbeat for \"Seed\" that's worth talking about. Still, I don't know why Geffen split this into two separate volumes except for the obvious $$$ reasons, and I don't know why, after culling pretty evenly from their studio LPs, the Roots left off \"Push Up Ya Lighter\". Criminy. Maybe then I would have read the liners. "}
