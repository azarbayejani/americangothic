{"label":" IAMSOUND","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/13945/homepage_large.eb011eb9.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Bevan","artist":"Suckers","title":"Suckers EP","text":" An increasingly whisperedabout Brooklyn fourpiece with a warehousecommune aesthetic that Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal accurately described as \"fourthgeneration hippie flotsam,\" Suckers' debut, foursong EP kneels before sonic idols (David Byrne, Isaac Brock) that actually share little in common with the band's sartorial affectations. Where most EPs put their best foot forward, here Suckers close with their strongest song to date: \"It Gets Your Body Movin'\", which does just as the song's title suggests and more it gets you singing as well.Call it a strong first impression  and mixtape ammo. Built around a base of tribal drums and waterlogged guitars, \"It Gets Your Body Movin'\" lives and dies by its titular refrain, five words that laced with a lazy bit of whistling crescendo and build and expand before bursting outright. By measure of sheer collective singalong voltage, one could tag the song an \"anthem\" and call it a day. But on a short release stuffed with and defined by oversized, campfire vocal confetti, I'm not sure how well the descriptor really captures the psychotropic pop spaces and grooves that Suckers and producer Anand Wilder (of fellow Brooklyn indierock mystics Yeasayer) are gunning for. This feels much more communal or even experiential than what that word connotes. This feels like a reason to hold hands and beat your chest, not place the former over the latter.Though the approach or rhythm differs, that vibe pervades throughout. On \"Beach Queen\", lead vocalist Quinn Walker sounds every bit as Byrnenian on his own as Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's Alec Ounsworth did when he arrived four years ago. The vocal hook isn't nearly as fetching as the way the synths melt into one another, but that itch to join in remains. \"Easy Chairs\" opens with a bit of PCP barbershop harmonizing before skipping off at a pace befitting its \"Ring Around the Rosies\" melody. \"Afterthoughts & TV\" boasts a galloping chorus that, while every bit as exuberant as \"Movin'\", features a buffet of instrumentation (horn explosions, piano, twang) that hints further at a band with an ear for more. Just four songs in and we've got a very satisfying, very clear idea of what to expect. To have more would be sweet, to continue to be plesantly surprised even better. "}
