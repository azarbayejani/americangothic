A dark electro track bearing that title appeared on their debut, Brownout, but the two previous Odd Job EPs predated that album, and I can hear only traces of the track on these six reworkings. Phoenecia may be fucking with my head with this cryptic discographical smokescreen, but I can deal: this EP is sweet. The kickoff flies through the uprights courtesy of Matmos, who dance the Garo Yepremian all over the characteristically dense and funky \"The Climatic Battle Scene Between Rom & Josh Version.\" The tune starts in Buck Rogers mode, tossing lasers, snarling drums and voices together like the Egyptian Lover upgraded to 32 bits. A third of the way in, live drums overwhelm the song and then trail off into polyrhythmic drum programming and a deep thicket of textured effects. Someone or something called Adult comes next, with a nostalgic electro trip fit for Rephlex called \"Compurythm Version\" that incorporates the new wave \"Me and My Rhythm Box\" from 80s cult film Liquid Sky. The primitive keyboards and drum pads benefit from a 21st century sensibility, and the track is nothing short of killer. Dino Felipe slows things down for the abstractly pretty \"Sun Deck Version,\" which has the flavor of the studied silliness that used to flow like Riesling from the AMusik compound. Prefuse 73's \"Ramen Noodle Version\" is very much of a piece with Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, with steady rolling beats, warm organ chords, and tiny fragments of rap tossed in the air like confetti. Otto Von Schirach gets a bit showy with his DSP tricks on \"Tre Deuce Ave. Smash & Grab Version,\" but he redeems himself with a hypnotic 808 bass hook and a complex beat that remains danceable. Closing out this 30minute set, Jeswa's \"Dreamlike Steak Version\" improves on the gauzy electronoir ambience of Autechre's \"Amber.\" (I was never crazy about that Ae record, though I know it is loved by many.) Whatever the actual sound files used to create Odd Job Discrimination, to my mind this is the perfect remix record short, punchy and great to listen to in one sitting. Though they remain in the armchair camp, Phoenecia's style of IDM gives much respect to the floorfilling rhythm. Most of the tracks on Odd Job Discrimination play up the latter quality, imparting a welcome sense of fun. You heard me right: fun. "}
