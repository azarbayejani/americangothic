Well, it certainly was, in any event, an Elevator. And that's the story of how Elevator got its name. Goodnight.\"\"Tell me another story about Elevator, Dad.\"\"No.\"\"I'll show Grandma those pictures I took of you and the garden hose.\"Jesus Christ, kid, how long you gonna hold that over my head? That's just how grownups water the lawn, I'm telling you! Augh, fine, one more. But it's a scary one, so get ready. It's a little story about how Elevator's lead vocalist Rick White went crazy, and now is almost impossible to take seriously. Ready?\"[Little Shaquille nods eagerly as his Grandpa slowly opens up the liner notes to Darkness > Light and begins to reads aloud.]\"'Elevator is an exploratory [sic], a living documentary, subconscious analysis and premonition. A taste of perspective combing for clues in apocalyptic time. Rolling fields of trees, at first one became these. The triangle, balance and the opposites. We eerily roamed the red landscape with the curious door in the sky, documenting with tape and paper.' And it goes on like this! You're a smart kid what's the moral of this story?\"\"Stay away from acid?\"\"Quite right, my lad. Now sleep well, if you can.\"\"Wait, Grandpa. Is LSD why Darkness > Light is so awful?\"\"No, son; it's pronounced \"psychedelic.\" That what the hippies called it \"psychrock,\" like the Floyd. All of Elevator's stuff is like that. Here, I'll play it. Now, what you're hearing the synth washes, the swirling tangles of guitar, the ridiculously 'freaky' vocals it might sound boring now, but Elevator's awesome when you're whacked out of your mind on psychotropes.\"\"What's 'psychotrope' mean?\"\"It means stay the hell away from it if you ever want to see your trust fund, like we talked about.\"\"This sounds bad. The thundering percussion and pulsing bass send surges of vitality through the opener, 'You're a Deep Dark Hole', but then everything dissolves into sludge. A few punkcharged riffs don't offer enough structure or excitement to keep the album from plunging into a relentless mire of noisefilth. I was so pumped full of Ritalin that I couldn't even sit through the 16minute masturbation marathon of the title track it's so sloppy and limp, like they can't even play their instruments, and worse, can't be bothered to even summon up some enthusiasm for the effort of trying.\"\"How the hell does a sixyear old learn to talk like that?\"\"I've been reading Pitchfork.\"\"Hmm... I'll need to send in some inane reader mail about this. But that's not the point did you even listen to the second half of the album?\"\"How could I make it through the first? Someone needs to clue Elevator in that the echo pedal is a privilege, not a right.\"\"Now, son, patience is a virtue. It gets better! If you don't grow old and die while waiting through the rough patches of the early tracks, Darkness > Light, as the name implies, improves substantially. Tara White's eerie coos drift in from somewhere just outside mortal realms of perception, breaking the vast lull in the interior of the album. 'The Endless Winter' and 'Love' are really standard, jangly, acoustic pieces, but they're very compelling. Tara White's vocals are in a separate league from Rick's whispered melodrama, mournful and haunting; the vocal duets between them have a fantastic air of mystery surrounding them. 'Down Here' sports a sharp, evocative solo that hints at the psychic crush of the first tracks, but couples it with actual musicianship for a slick closing piece. It's too bad if you can just sit through the first half, you'll enjoy the weird, secretive melodies of the later cuts.\"\"But this first half is such a clusterfuck, Dad! I won't believe the second part is that good, and you can't make me.\"\"'The Bloom' does kinda slide into formlessness for a while, and the singsongy speech gets old, but... Never mind. First part bad, second part good. Get to sleep. Oh, and son stay way from...\"\"Acid. I know, Dad.\"\"No, from Pitchfork; they've got you swearing like a sailor.\"Â  "}
