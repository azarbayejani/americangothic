That's the best way I can think to sum up Big Star Story, a retrospective compilation so riddled with problems it's difficult to decide where to start talking about them. It seems pretty obvious that the folks at Ryko were trying to come up with a set that could serve both as an introduction to the band's work and as a sort of capsule overview of a band whose status in the rock canon is nothing short of mythical. The result, unfortunately, does the group's legacy a tremendous disservice. Perhaps the single greatest sin of this collection is that it's patently unnecessary. Anyone who wants an introduction to Big Star should just pick up their first two albums, #1 Record and Radio City, which are still available as a twoforone on a single disc from Ardent Records and usually list for around $13.99. If you want more, track down Ryko's own reissue of the band's swansong, Third/Sister Lovers, a release that gathers virtually every song cut during the chaotic sessions that birthed that album. Congratulations, you now own every piece of Big Star's essential output. If you really want to go crazy, you can even shell out for Big Star Live, which catches the band near their peak in concert, and Nobody Can Dance, a compilation of some outtakes and sundry live performances (for the hardcore only). After that, there's nothing left but the solo albums.Big Star Story's superfluousness established, there's also the fact that it doesn't even live up to its name. This is not the \"Big Star Story\" it claims to be the tracks aren't even in chronological order, and two of the selections, \"I Am the Cosmos\" and \"You & Your Sister\", aren't Big Star songs at all. These last two are actually the A and Bsides of a solo single Chris Bell single released on Chris Stamey's Car Records after Bell had left the band. Suffice to say, you'll get a few scenes from Big Star's career here, but you'll never be able to glean the plot from the haphazard tracklist. And about that tracklist: it is theoretically possible to compile a satisfying \"best of Big Star\" release, but this doesn't even come close. First, considering the formidable songwriting talents of Alex Chilton and Chris Bell (and even Andy Hummel), why on earth are there two covers on here? Loudon Wainwright III's \"Motel Blues\" is a great song, and Chilton handles it well, but T.Rex's \"Baby Strange\" just sounds creepy when Chilton warbles, \"I just wanna ball ya,\" and aside from the quality of the performances, they're just not Big Star songs nor are they essential enough pieces of the band's oeuvre to justify wasting the space on them. They're not integral to the story, you might say. Each album is fairly wellrepresented, with five tracks from Third and four each from #1 Record and Radio City, but the sequencing is jarring, highlighting just how drastically different Third is from its predecessors. Further injustice is served by the fact that \"Mod Lang\", \"You Get What You Deserve\" (from Radio City) and \"Don't Lie to Me\", (from #1 Record) are each presented in inferior alternate versions culled from Nobody Can Dance instead of their definitive versions, while \"Thirteen\" (from #1 Record) is snatched from Big Star Live (an admittedly strong performance, but not as rending as the original). The moment where the disc's inherent clumsiness comes into sharpest focus is the one where the crystalline, majestic harmonies of #1 Record's \"Ballad of El Goodo\" give way to Third's crumpled centerpiece, the haunting death whisper \"Holocaust\". Though both are excellent songs, they don't share a state of mind, nor do they sit well next to each other. The reason Big Star's first two albums work so well on a single disc together is that they're fundamentally similar each captures the sound of some anglophile kids from the American heartland perfecting a ragged brand of powerpop fit for the ages. Those albums feel like the band knows they're destined to be huge the strumming is confident, the hooks are punchy, the awkward, everyman vocals somehow swagger, and there's exuberance in even the most subdued songs. That the feeling persists on Radio City is somewhat remarkable considering the public indifference that met #1 Record at the time, and the fact that Bell departed during the sessions, despondent at the band's lack of success. Two years later, the band still hadn't made it, and you can hear it all over Third. It's a recorded document of a band disintegrating while simultaneously trying to grow. The expansive production and experimentation of that record are wholesale left turns from their earlier material, and the final result is a brilliant, timeless shambles. Removed from their natural surroundings, \"Nightime\", \"Holocaust\", \"Thank You Friends\", \"Jesus Christ\", and \"O, Dana\" are all still good songs, but they carried more power as parts of a logical whole. And, as mentioned before, Ryko's reissue of that album is everything a reissue should be informative, comprehensive, and brilliantly mastered. Of course, I still haven't mentioned the most heinous aspect of this compilation: the bait track. Yes, there's a song on this disc that has never been released before, called \"Hot Thing\". Completists, beware: this is unquestionably the worst track to have ever been branded with the Big Star name worse, even, than the rotten Thirdera outtake \"Downs\". Recorded by the reunion lineup in the 90s, it's a lifeless, amelodic song that should have been better considering that Alex Chilton, Jody Stephens and Posies cofrontmen Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow all share its songwriting credit. Even the horn part sucks. And the worst part is that it's included in lieu of any of a dozen other fantastic songs. If this compilation is truly trying to tell the Big Star story, where are important chapters like \"Watch the Sunrise\", \"Stroke It, Noel\", \"Way Out West\", \"You Can't Have Me\", \"I'm in Love with a Girl\", \"Kizza Me\", \"Kangaroo\", \"When My Baby's Beside Me\", \"What's Going Ahn\", and you get the point. Seriously, even if you've never heard Big Star and have no idea where to start, you should still head straight to the albums. They're available on a grand total of two discs, and both of those discs belong in the collection of anyone who ever loved the sound of pop songs played on guitars. If you want to keep going from there, it's up to you, but for God's sake, don't trust this thing to start you off on the right foot. "}
