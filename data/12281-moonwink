Early reviews of the Spinto Band's latest album, Moonwink, have noted with some surprise that it's technically the eighth (or, depending whose count you believe, ninth) fulllength from the youthful Delaware sextet. All prior releases, though, appeared on the band's own Spintonic at least until their aptly titled 2005 Bar/None debut, Nice and Nicely Done, later reissued overseas by Virgin UK. That makes Moonwink a classic sophomore slump, bursting with melody but overorchestrated and overthought.Neurotic, hookpacked songs like \"Trust vs. Mistrust\" and \"Crack the Whip\" made Nice and Nicely Done sound like the Spinto Band could become the Weezer of the new wave revival, splitting the difference between Pavement's Brighten the Corners and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. The ringing guitars and Arcade Firesized arrangement of Nice and Nicely Done highlight \"Oh Mandy\" find a quirkier successor in solid Moonwink single \"Summer Grof\", a handclapping, punning ditty the band describes as \"a vague tribute to the great comedienne Janeane Garofalo.\" We don't know who Spinto Band's Mandy was, either, but this song's willful obscurity is typical of an album that's often too clever by half.As if to compensate for weaker songs, Moonwink lets the Spinto Band indulge their instinct toward lavishness. \"The Carnival\" has the (dizzying) merrygoround melodies its title implies, and it's one of the more restrained examples of the album's flightly falsetto harmonies, whoaoh melismas, and careening strings and horns. Castanetclicking opener \"Later On\" and synthled \"Vivian, Don't\" have some whimsical charm, but by the time Spinto Band slow down for \"They All Laughed\", it's as if Humpty Dumpty fell off the Wall of Sound. Singer/guitarist Nick Krill's high, anxious voice starts to grate between the lalas and nice guitar raveup of \"The Cat's Pajamas\", but it's his quieter colleague, singer/bassist Thomas Hughes, who sounds like he's auditioning to be the model of a modern major general on \"Needlepoint\", one of a few highly theatrical songs here relating to attire.Moonwink wouldn't be so disappointing if Nice and Nicely Done hadn't been unusually promising. The Spinto Band even have a stirring live show. Their latest record has more instruments and lyrical or melodic turns than hooks to hold onto, but its problem is more like an excess of ideas than a lack of them. \"If I don't get your letter then I'll know you're in jail,\" Krill assures on glockenspielchimer \"The Black Flag\"; it's as overflowing as its neighbors but with its \"Revolution\"esque guitar bursts and a chorus that hammers its way into your head a hopeful finale. Don't know much about algebra, but I hear the third time's the charm. "}
