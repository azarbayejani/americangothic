Even my egomania can't pretend to be worthy of mediating the insane glory of this compilation. The scoop: Ads were placed in magazines throughout the 1960s and 70s for \"songs\" and \"poems\" that were \"needed\" for recording. And the salt of our exclusively Godblessed nation stood horny to (pay to) volunteer their inane scribblings for semicynical onetake sessioneers. I hate to whip out Greil's grail, but this CD teems with the \"old, weird America\" that still survives on public access TV and in the Culkinfucking AOL chatrooms. Type up www.aspma.com for the full story of how the musicians used selfprotecting pseudonyms and committed suicides; I can barely sober up enough to summarize certain of its 28 dumbfounding cuts, almost all of which are characterized by awkward phrasing and excellent musicianship: \"Rat a Tat Tat, America\": A bicentennial march about the dignity of birds that somehow builds to a machinegun salute to our freest of lands that sold guns to Indonesian rapists, etc. Imagine an \"I Like Ike\"era Disney response to Bowling for Columbine. \"I Like Yellow Things\": Plagiarizes at least three standards to constitute an easyboogie, canarythemed list, a la The Sound of Music. A \"Pomp and Circumstance\" for the short bus set. \"I'm Just the Other Woman\": Sung by a trilling male, from a lovestung Lazarus' point of view. John Waters needs this bad. \"Human Breakdown of Absurdity\": David Koresh gets a thesaurus. Something wonderful about Israel and the occult and the government and the undead and massacres and whores. \"Richard Nixon\": Stunning slice of civil religion, circa 'Nambat. I promise it ain't just a novelty; you'll recue the chorus, \"God in his infinite wisdom put Richard Nixon on this Earth/ To bring to us his heritage, one of priceless worth.\" This ode to a \"blessed man, surely in God's plan\" will warm your heart as you give thanks for how Condolences Rice has hit up TVangelist Jack Van Impe for an \"outline\" of Revelation/Armageddon. Nixon is a \"genius,\" a \"miracle,\" \"the rapture of music and melody/ of culture and of love.\" And curse those damned Jews! \"Jimmy Carter Says Yes\": Isaac Hayes does The Nation. Superfly does Plains, Georgia. The referendum gets skullpimped.  \"How Long Are You Staying\": Every line rhymes \"disco\" (Frisco, Crisco), but I can't tell if it's about unemployment or blueballs.  \"I Lost My Girl to an Argentinean Cowboy\": Either the most suave slice of mannuendo ever, or the funniest slice of unintentional homoeroticism ever. Thrill to the saga of a \"cooing\" \"gayboy\" \"hipshooting\" \"cavalier\" \"whipcracking\" \"greatromancing\" \"tenor.\" Watch out for the \"bunkhouse gang.\"  \"Ecstasy to Frenzy\": Fits seamlessly between \"Crimson and Clover\" and Forever Changes. The disc's best \"straight\" song, even if it's quaazonked. \"All You Need Is a Fertile Mind\": A touching (teehee) indictment of pornography, espousing a healthier masturbatory ethic of pretending. Why feed a \"woman like Venus\" when you could just \"unwind\" to the fantasy that your hand is a dreamcootch? When the backup singers kick in, decrying \"material waste of photography,\" you'll know in your rank heart that the smutkings are but brainwashers. \"Gretchen's New Dish\": Wow. Wow. Oh man. Whew. Wow. Possibly the catchiest celebration of pedophile incest scatcrimes yet, beating out even Whitney Houston's \"The Greatest Love of All\". A sixyearold \"full of doodoo\"`gets a present that a \"liquid swish\" lights up, just like \"Pa does his mustache cup.\" I can't stop singing it. The children really are the future, I decided long ago. \"Blind Man's Penis\": I hope my mom isn't reading this review. These lyrics aren't honest; they're by someone who sent them in to see how far the songpoem orchestras would go for a vanitybuck. This anthem is about warts and nipples and zebras and Nazis and erections and gelatinfingers. Recommended for white weddings. "}
