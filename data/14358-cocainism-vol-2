Pt. II isn't a particularly faithful sequel. It didn't share its predecessor's plot points or characters; at best, it was a similar story refracted through the prism of the current economy. The original Cuban Linx was informed by the flush, Clintonera times and played out like cinema, nothing but fantastical personalities, desperate optimism, and opulence. But Pt. II's drug raps were crushingly realistic and bleak, survival the only reward in sight.So, if nothing else, it's strange to hear Raekwon... well, really enjoying himself on Cocainism, Vol. 2 (as of now, a Vol. 1 cannot be located). The more upbeat Cocainism is a \"rapper's rapper\" mixtape, a display of Raekwon's oftoverlooked, masterful technique. Strangely, Rae's usually more animated cohort Ghostface shows up only in spirit \"Ms. Sincere\" is pure wisdom body sweet talk, and the uncomfortably graphic \"Lizz\" is about as close as Raekwon will likely get to his own \"Stapleton Sex\". Instead, it's Alchemist who provides most of the levity, as \"Big Beat\" serves up classic breaks from Billy Squier and Mark Ronson, while \"Wallys & Pringles\" is damn near a tribute to Fast Rap.But within Cocainism's 20 tracks, Rae occasionally flashes the sort of hardscrabble conscience that kept Pt. II  street level. \"Keep On\" is the kind of track most fans would likely prefer he go nowhere near the beat is polished for Hot 97 display, the hook supplied by someone intended to sound like Akon. But the subject matter remains unapologetically grim as it observes two victims of drugrelated tragedy, the first a stickup kid whose stray bullet turned into a prison lifer, the second a humble, hardworking African cabdriver stabbed up by his cokedup wife. In a crushing detail, Rae mentions in a tossedoff aside how he would often serve as their chauffeur for pickups.Cocainism runs a bit ragged by the end (\"Do It in the Park\" and \"Piss in the Shark Tank\" fail to live up to the enormous promise of their titles), even if it avoids some of the more serious mixtape pitfalls. For backend mixtape rappers, Mean Doe Green and Tommy Nova acquit themselves quite nicely and the bigger names are wellselected; Mobb Deep have rarely sounded more committed as a group recently than they do on \"Road to Riches\", and while Noreaga mostly embarrasses himself trying out a Blueprint 3 flow on \"Slow Down\", he's redeemed by a TMZtimely punchline: \"We get it poppin' like LeBron James' mom (Delonte West, you foul!).\" Sure, it'd be nice for there to be some sort of unifying thread to Cocainism that could elevate it to elite status, but as anyone who's sat through Immobilarity or can name more than two members of the Ice H20 crew can attest, it's relief enough that Rae is capable of a damn solid rap album working outside of his Cuban Linx franchise.
