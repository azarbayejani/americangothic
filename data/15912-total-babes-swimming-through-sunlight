It's a fitting place of origin considering their debut, 30 minutes of hooky punk songs, hits a number of garagerock beats: Their aesthetic offers Wavvescolored juvenility, their sound an inthered fuzz with a subtle pop sensibility and vocals delivered with a bratty abandon. Despite the shimmering album title, dinosaurandice cream cover art, and bratty delivery, though, Swimming's a darker album than you might expect. Most of the 30 minutes consist of fast, jovialsounding power chords, yes, but beneath the fuzz is a series of songs that builds a narrative about deteriorating love. It begins innocently enough with a series of drum crashes and a tossedoff line,\"My thoughts just turn to you/ Just like they always do.\" Soon enough, things get heavier, from the semidesperate promises of \"Be So True\" to the postbreakup of \"Someone to Blame\". It culminates in \"Without Your Heart\", a track that uses the vocals, tone, and hook of a 1950s teardrops ballad. It's the most cleareyed and clean sounding song on the record. The group is commonly cited as a Cloud Nothings side project, and while there are connections between the two Clevelandarea garage bands, that's not exactly the case. Cloud Nothings is primarily the project of Dylan Baldi, so although Jayson Gerycz has played drums on one or two singles, this is his first time recording as a multiinstrumentalist, let alone as a songwriter. Some of that inexperience shows. Taken separately, the songs are driving punk gems; as a whole, they rarely offer a change of pace. The material is repetitive (down to the same general vocal patterns), each song bleeding into the next. The lyrics of each track push the story forward, but even that becomes difficult to parse past the samey delivery. Only the 50s vibe of \"Without Your Heart\" and the jangling, echoing closer \"Tip of My Tongue\" offer a rest. That said, the semiaggressive tone can serve as an earcatching counterbalance to the emotional outpouring: \"Don't Have to Run\" leads with a vicious, rolling drum crash while asking, \"How will I go on without you?\"; \"Rot Away\" features a more upbeat hook than the title suggests, though Brown does yell, \"I'll rot away inside your gaze,\" in the chorus. Catharsis is good, but slathering a variety of emotions with such consistently muffled vocals and guitar distortion cheapens their point. By the halfway mark, Swimming Through Sunlight starts sounding less like a garagerock band and more like some kid howling about frustrated heartbreak in his parent's garage. "}
