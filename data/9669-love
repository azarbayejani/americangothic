But a snippet fits very nicely in the third position on Love, the Beatles catalog remix album and Cirque de Soleil soundtrack created by George Martin and his son Giles. After an angelic \"Because\" a capella, but here fluffed up with bird songs there's the \"A Hard Days Night\" chord into Ringo's drum solo on \"The End\", which then fades into \"Get Back\".\"Glass Onion\" was Lennon having fun with the Beatles myth, referencing his earlier songs and mocking the tendency to \"decode\" them that would eventually get way out of hand when Beach Boys pal and \"Never Learn Not to Love\" composer Charles Manson sent his minions into Beverly Hills to commit mass murder. \"Glass Onion\" was Lennon's attempt on the fly, while the band was at its peak at recontextualizing his Beatles work, to remind us all that music is supposed to be fun. The joker was laughing with us, jabbing an elbow in our sides to say, \"Hey, we're just a pop band here, folks.\"That's a good thing to keep in mind with the Beatles. They were just a pop band, even if they were possibly the greatest entity ever to fit that particular classification. The Beatles were so good that they're not very interesting to talk about it's like listening to someone drone on about the Grand Canyon. No other band has generated as much dull commentary, even as the music remains unimpeachable.They're certainly the best band I almost never listen to. I'm guessing I share this with a lot of music obsessives; the Beatles' music has been so thoroughly absorbed into our consciousness that we can play the songs in our heads any time we like. Which is why the idea of someone doing something new with the catalog mixing and matching different songs, blending the whole thing into an epic suite is potentially exciting. Any attempt to fiddle with this music is like longdistance brain surgery, toying with our collective memory with the hope of creating something new.Listening to Love I'm reminded first of a few artists that took from the Beatles without their permission, and how illicit beginnings gave their samples an extra hit of fun. There's the entire Danger Mouse/JayZ mashup The Grey Album, of course, but I'm thinking of smaller details. When Ringo Starr's solo from \"The End\" appears early here I go immediately to Jason Forrest's \"Ten Amazing Years\", not Abbey Road. The swirl of strings from \"Good Night\" stitched here to Ringo's \"Octopus's Garden\" brings to mind Ekkehard Ehlers' drawnout loop of the same phrase that comprises the entirety of one side of \"Ekkehard Ehlers Plays John Cassavetes\". Having all the mixes bandsanctioned loses a little something. Paul McCartney is said to have heard Love and remarked that he wished it went a bit further out. And it's hard not to agree, especially for people used to hearing mashups and guerilla sonic deconstruction via laptop. How badly do you want Yamatsuka Eye to do a Rebore Vol. 0 on this material?Really, the mashedup bits here are just a seasoning, the occasional jarring effect to remind us that we're not just sitting around listening to Beatles records. Who knew that the backing track for \"Drive My Car\" fit perfectly over verses from \"The Word\" and \"What You're Doing\"? The a capella \"Sun King\" sounds great backward on \"Gnik Nus\" leading beautifully into \"Something\" and doesn't contain any hidden messages beyond the one conveyed by the opening \"Because\" that the Beatles were great singers. \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\" seems a natural soundtrack for tumbling acrobats, and the coda to \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" sounds like it was made for this project.As the album wears on, the songs get \"bigger\" and are also made to stand on their own, without the mix trickery. But they also suffer from truncation. It's great to hear a round of the \"Hey Jude\"'s epic chorus with just voice and drums, but the song means so much less at four minutes than it does at seven, with a full verse cut and the final fade happening earlier. I will say that hearing it pulled apart finally confirms that Beta Band's \"Dry the Rain\" steals from it almost completely, one instrument after another.It seems impossible to follow the final chord of \"A Day in the Life\", but the Martins are just closing the door on the darker, artier aspect of the Beatles, letting the uplifting pop band carry the day during the album's final section. The trimmed \"Hey Jude\", the reprise of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (let's face it not great, but included because of all the showbiz connotations) and then closing with \"All You Need Is Love\".What seems to consume people most about this record is the sound of the thing, just how beautifully the original material was recorded and how great it comes over on a purely sonic level. The art of recording a rock band, it seems, reached its zenith in the late 1960s. In terms of capturing guitar, bass, drums, and voice, nothing since no matter how many tracks sounds as pure and lovely as what the Beatles did at Abbey Road studios. Love is turning everyone into an audiophile, then, which means it's making younger people a little older. And it's also a mashup remix, which means it's making older people a little younger. They were just a pop band, yes, but if anyone can bring all these music fans together under one tent, it's the Beatles. Which is what Love is ultimately all about. "}
