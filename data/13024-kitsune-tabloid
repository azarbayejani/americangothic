{"label":" Kitsuné","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/14020/homepage_large.0b315c14.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andrew Gaerig","artist":"Phoenix","title":"Kitsuné Tabloid 2009","text":" Phoenix's entire output makes me feel like I'm touring Europe's sexiest cities and smoking fancy cigarettes while in the throes of an \"arty\" tomboy model. Their choices for the second volume of the Kitsuné Tabloid series following Digitalism's 2008 mix one might assume would play on this aesthetic, outcooling listeners with obscurant or ultrahip selections. Instead, Phoenix turn in a modest and loving mixtape full of songs aimed at pricking ears rather than popping eyeballs. Kitsuné Tabloid openly displays Phoenix's love for all manners of charming, offbeat music: There's precious little cratedigging, in part because even if the average Phoenix fan doesn't know a lick about Tangerine Dream or the Red Krayola, it's likely that your average Kitsuné consumer does.If Tabloid has a discernible theme, it's probably Phoenix's reverence for early rock'n'soul, as the mix touches on not just the Impressions but Ritchie Valens, Irma Thomas, Dusty Springfield, and likeminded imitators Elvis Costello, Chris Bell (Big Star), and Dennis Wilson. Major stylistic diversions include R&B, Brazilian pop, and indie rock, but there's plenty of wiggle room to be had in that first list, and Tabloid never feels monotonous or truly predictable.Kitsuné Tabloid is weighed down by one or two too many long tracks, which makes it a little bit like a Phoenix album anyway. But even at its most tedious, Tabloid  exposes commonalities between unlike partners, its careful sequencing revealing the swooning overlap between Costello's \"Shipbuilding\" and D'Angelo's \"Send It On\", or the feverdreams shared by the Red Krayola's \"Victory Garden\" and the Impressions' \"I've Been Trying\". Tabloid even stumbles into the sublime, such as when its final coupling, Springfield's take on \"I Think It's Gonna Rain Today\" and its keystone line, \"Human kindness is overflowing\" and Lou Reed's \"Street Hassle\", dovetail into a warming thematic climax. Phoenix even manage to freshen up the 13th Floor Elevators' \"I Had to Tell You\" and Wilson's \"Lady (Falling in Love)\", divorcing those songs from their often weighty contexts (though even four fashionable French rockers can't repurpose Urge Overkill, arguably this mix's most surprising selection).It's (only) a little unfair to read Phoenix's style in these choices this is a mixtape, not a list of influences but Tabloid does seem to favor long, pretty songs that eschew rigidity in favor of strands of repeated melody. See: Chris Bell's \"I Am the Cosmos\", Costello's \"Shipbuilding\", or Roxy Music's \"Pyjamarama\". Instrumental choices like Tangerine Dream's \"Love on a Real Train\" or Iggy Pop and James Williamson's \"Master Change\" are fitting for a band whose albums often include at least one mostly wordless epic. Tabloid only occasionally feels self conscious or overconsidered, such as during its opening two songs, Kiss' instrumental \"Love Theme From Kiss\" and the Dirty Projectors \"Rise Above\", an awesome track that nonetheless carries an air of hot'n'now cred that the rest of the compilation avoids.But more than flashy or progressive or obscure, Tabloid feels considerate, at least as considerate as a mixtape made by four strangers for Vicemagazine readers can be. There are blatant stylistic disconnects in the sequencing; there are some long songs, silly songs, bad songs, and at least one song you've probably not heard (for me: Lo Borges' \"Aos Baroes\"). All of this makes it very much like a mixtape one of your friends might pass you, which sort of suppresses my jetsetting fantasies as I pull over into an offhighway Chickfila. "}
