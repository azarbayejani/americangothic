Of course, the feeling is mostly superficial, manifesting in jaunty melodies and bright acoustic guitar as Middleton burrs morosely about moretypical Strap fare loneliness, insecurity, cursing and it doesn't last. Yet Into the Woods shows Middleton's growth since 2003's awkward 5:14 Fluoxytine Seagull Alcohol John Nicotine into a witty, selfeffacing, and eagertoplease singersongwriter. The troubadour Middleton most resembles is fellow happysad Glaswegian Gary Lightbody. \"Loneliness Shines\" leans on Snow Patrol's gussiedupMBV noise squalls, while \"Choir\" picks up Final Straw's search for the hugely, glisteningly anthemic in fragile personal details. Reindeer Section's Jenny Reeve even guests on the catchiest track, \"A Happy Medium\", an allgrins jolt of jingling dancefloor folktronica. \"My face is a disease,\" Middleton spits out incongruously. It's such bitter lyrics that distance Into the Woods from Lightbody's bands. On \"Autumn\", Middleton addresses the season as \"you fucking cunt\" over gloomy piano straight from Gary Jules' rendition of \"Mad World\"; \"Burst Noel\" recounts a Christmas spent watching \"EastEnders\" all alone after getting knifed. Middleton tends to indulge in songs about songs, which, like reviews about reviews, can be either a crutch or a coup, depending on execution. Splashy opener \"Break My Heart\" plays this game fairly well with lovelorn pop's eternal catch22: If the girl doesn't break the singer's heart, she'll ruin his career. It's hard to fault the song's gamely cheerful piano and upbeat tune, and it's easy to envision crowds lapping up its niceguy sweetness. Amid fingerpicking, clouds of distortion, and Celtic strings, \"Monday Night Nothing\" makes a more pedestrian selfreference, as Middleton confesses, \"I don't know how to finish this song\"; by the Notwistesque electropop of \"Solemn Thirsty\", dude's speaking teenromancemovie: \"How do I write a song and give it to the girl?\" Then finale \"A New Heart\" pokes fun at itself and Arab Strap's welldocumented profanity by neatly dodging dirty rhymes. None of this explains Middleton's bear fixation (a number of the species' representatives rear their heads throughout the album), but why quibble? In the ultimate sensitivesingersongwriter move, Middleton depicts himself as a guy who's just looking for the perfect girl but can't seem to find her. "}
