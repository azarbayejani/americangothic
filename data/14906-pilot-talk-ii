Curren$y is a great pure rapper, a language addict with a tricky slipsliding delivery and an ability to keep going for minutes at a time, uninterrupted by choruses. But he's not the type to smash us over the head with his strengths. Instead, his understated punchlines sneakily find ways into your brain and stay there. And after he spent years with hometown powerhouses No Limit and Cash Money, and then on the mixtape circuit, Curren$y finally found his ideal place on the first Pilot Talk album, just a few months old now. Teaming almost exclusively with veteran New York producer Ski Beatz, Curren$y rapped over a luxuriously dazed bed of lavalamp instrumentals that pulled plenty of sounds from woozy psychrock. And on the sequel, Curren$y and Ski go even further with that central idea, pushing into sleepy, smooth funk territory that fits Curren$y's rap style perfectly.My favorite Curren$y track from the past year is \"4 Hours & 20 Minutes (Ride to HTown)\", a teamup with the blowhard Houston underground fixture Killa Kyleon that hit rap blogs shortly after the release of the first Pilot Talk. That rumbling, bassheavy track doesn't appear on Pilot Talk II, and its omission is actually a good thing. Both of these Pilot Talk fulllengths work on vibe, and \"4 Hours & 20 Minutes\" would've interrupted the spaceout. So instead of the classically thundering Southern rap of that song, we get a milieu that Curren$y himself describes beautifully on \"Montreux\": \"It's that 1980 Marvin Gaye, live at the Montreux/ Stars in the audience, Al Jarreau in the third row.\" (That Curren$y considers Al Jarreau a star is the sort of thing that sets him apart from the rest of the rap universe circa 2010.) These aqueous beats come fleshed out with all sorts of beautifully rendered live instrumentation: horns and flutes and pianos and Fender Rhodes and slowrolling standup bass and delicately winding acoustic guitars. I've yet to hear any chillwave quite this chill.And tracks like these turn out to be perfect for the slick shit that Curren$y talks so well. Spitta's favorite subject is weed, naturally enough, and both the music and his effortlessly calm delivery do great work at conjuring the sticky languor of a satisfying high. But his other lyrical touchstones are classic Southern rap material: girls, cars, money. Curren$y finds artful, sidelong ways of approaching this stuff punchlines that can read awkwardly on paper but sound amazing the way he delivers them.The first Pilot Talk came with some bigname guests: Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, Devin the Dude. But on the sequel, guys like that don't fit; it's all about Curren$y drawing us into his own universe. Other than a nice Raekwon verse on the albumclosing remix, everyone comes from Curren$y's own camp, including a great turn from his fellow No Limit veteran, the newly relaxed Fiend. When Jay Electronica showed up on the first installment, he stole the spotlight with a rigorous monster verse. Nothing like that happens here, and the album's sustained zoneout is the better for it.And though this is mostly a deepmeditative rapping exercise, we do get one song, \"Silence\", that shows that Curren$y's style could work in a pop context if he wanted it to. The song comes with a gorgeously breathy chorus from R&B singer McKenzie Eddy and makes great use of a prettily still piano line. And even though the track sounds like a breakup song, Curren$y's not having any of that: \"High when I stroll, not even leaving footprints in the snow, you know?\" For this guy, anything less wouldn't make sense.
