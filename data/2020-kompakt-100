{"label":" Kompakt","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/2004/homepage_large.d821e1e3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Dominique Leone","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Kompakt 100","text":" In interviews with preeminent German techno label/distributor Kompakt's principals (founders Michael Mayer and Wolfgang Voigt), the notion of \"family spirit\" often comes up. Since the Colognebased enterprise originated as a record store, many of the artists, producers and other associates not only share aesthetic ideals, but close physical proximity. Aksel \"Superpitcher\" Schaufler started out working in the store before releasing his music on the label, and was already close friends with Mayer, Voigt and DJ Tobias Thomas; Tobias worked with Jörg \"The Modernist\" Burger on the scene mag House Attack prior to making his first production appearance for the Kompakt clan (via the sibling label Profan) on \"Sweet\" Reinhard Voigt's M 12inch in 1996. Yet, despite Kompakt's incestuous nature, the label has succeeded in avoiding being pigeonholed as merely a purveyor of Kraftwerkborn, minimal dance music. In 2000, their Schaffelseiber compilation promoted \"shuffletech\" as a new slant on techno's timehonored 4/4 pulse by shifting the upbeats over a tad to produce a lightly swinging groove more related to the blues than the ultrawhite Kraftwerk/Giorgio Moroder template. And unlike Paul Van Dykstyle arenarave extravaganzas, Kompakt artists are more likely to bathe in puffed bliss than pump out PLURoughfare for space cadets. Artists like Kaito, Markus Guentner and The Orb have more in common with Brian Eno than The Bee Gees: Clear, uncluttered productions and an ambient, electronic sheen provide the spark in their nearcolorless (yet intricate) structures and midnight vamps.Kompakt 100 celebrates the label's 100th vinyl release (not counting the subsidiary labels) filling four LPs (or two CDs) with Kompakt artists remixing Kompakt artists. This differs from past compilations (like the Pop Ambient and Total series) in that none of the original tracks are actually new, but taken as a whole, the collection is a convenient summary of the imprint's first six years. However, it doesn't necessarily represent the current state of Kompakt, where artists like Justus Köhncke and Superpitcher are pushing its traditionally understated ideals to the brink with comparatively extroverted disco, approaching pure, shiny pop via excellent 2004 releases. Though both of these artists are represented on this compilation, I'd like to have heard more of their influence throughout. Kompakt 100 is a decent introduction to the label for newcomers, but fans may feel the remixes don't improve or update their sources enough to warrant repeated plays. Though the set isn't programmed to flow together as a continuous mix, the best moments occur when the track sequencing cooperates with the songs' momentum. On the first disc of the CD version, there's a threesong stretch featuring The Modernist's remix of Köhncke's \"Weiche Zaune\", Joachim Spieth's pounding mix of Mayer's shuffle \"17 & 4\" and the first of two versions of Superpitcher's \"Tomorrow\" that suggests Kompakt 100 could make a fine party starter. Coming out of the hard, squelched bassline of \"17 & 4\", Kaito's mix of the Superpitcher song glides by with precision and grace, accentuating Schaufler's original vocal with airy synths and fashion show chic. Wassermann (a Mayer alias) almost keeps pace with a smooth, dreamy mix of Reinhard Voigt's \"Robson Ponte\" but the CD recedes into cloudy floss prematurely with two melancholy remixes by Guentner (Kaito's \"Respect to the Distance\") and label elder statesman Olaf Dettinger (Closer Musik's \"One Two Three [No Gravity]\"). The second disc follows a similar pattern, right down to the final two tracks of warm, fuzzy ambience. The obvious highlight is Köhncke's version of the Freiland (aka Wolfgang Voigt) track \"Frei\" mashed with Marc Bolan's \"Hot Love\", transforming pleasant shuffletech into glamrock for androids at press time, Köhncke is arguably the only person in the world who can sell a line like, \"He ain't no bitch, and I love the way he twitch, uhhuh,\" convincingly. Jurgen Paape's mix of Schaeben & Voss' \"The World Is Crazy\" and their own reworking of \"Dicht Dran\" works well as a double shot of aggressive microhouse (also featuring micromelody), while Closer Musik's Matias Aguayo teams with Leandro Fresco to turn Fresco's \"Cera Uno\" into a burning, bassheavy techsamba. Elsewhere, as on ScSi9's mix of \"Tomorrow\", inoffensive pleasantries threaten to steal wind from the disc's sails, but as with the Kompakt label itself, 100 generally returns whatever interest you care to invest.
