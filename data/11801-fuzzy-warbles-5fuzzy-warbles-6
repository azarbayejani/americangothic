Luckily, these two most recent volumes are as random a mess as the first four. Imagine if Andy Partridge had carefully curated these Warbles albums by theme, chronology, or quality instead of just digging them out from under his bed. As it is even though he saved us the work of snatching up cassettes, singles, and mp3s in order to collect all of this stuff diehard XTC completists still have to slog through his scattered piles. Volumes five and six are another mixed bag: About half of the tracks are demos of songs you've already heard on XTC records, but only a few are worth listening to in this form: The skiffle version of \"Dear God\" beats the portentous final version, \"Human Alchemy\" has more nervous energy and a better bass line, \"Earn Enough For Us\" actually works better in a rougher, struggling demo. Diehards will enjoy the behindthescenes listen to the making of \"Mermaid Smiling\", on which Partridge mocks up the arrangement at home and finds ways to beat the back of his guitar or inject white noise as he imagines the orchestrations to come. But the miracle of modern home recording allows Partridge to simulate Nonsuch's \"Rook\" and \"Omnibus\" so completely that they mirror the final versions. And speaking of inessential, do we need these (unlistenable) demos from Big Express? I buy these collections for their new material, like Fuzzy Warbles 6's Nonsuch leftovers the dense lyrics of buttonedup regret on \"End Of the Pier\" and the jumbled \"Prince of Orange\", on which the keyboard riff hits as unexpectedly as a broken seconds hand. \"I Can't Tell What Truth Is Anymore\" and \"The Tiny Circus of Life\" are solid XTC tracks, and the albums are also littered with perfect ideas in halfsturdy containers: images like \"the angel that fell for me,\" from 5's \"Defy You Gravity\" deserve a more permanent home. The sixth volume, which begins and ends in laughter, has the smoothest sequencing and most consistent quality level of any Warbles collection so far. But 5 contains more revealing material, including mid80s leftovers from Mummer, Big Express, and Skylarking. Those albums followed Partridge as he ditched the glitz and anxiety of touring to come home, and wrote more reflective songs about England, the challenge of supporting a family, and the pitfalls of marriage. On XTC's most famous record, Skylarking, he and Colin Moulding even pulled these themes into a song cycle about nothing less than the circle of life and death. But the castoffs are more intriguing. For all the songs Partridge has written about man's destruction of nature (see: Apple Venus Vol. 1), none spilled oil across more pastures than the clanking rhythms and WD40 guitar on \"Motorcycle Landscapes\", with its seared riff and lyrics like, \"Glued up youths in high spirits throw kittens on the fire/ And down molester alley, the stabbed all roll in bliss.\" By contrast, the lyrics of \"Broomstick Rhythm\" anticipate Skylarking's \"Season Cycle\", and the sweet melody describes Partridge's fall into the bliss of domesticity. Volume five actually starts with Partridge's finest rarity the Mummer reject \"Young Cleopatra\". It's an ecstatic portrait of a 14yearold regent of the schoolyard, a kid who irresistably draws the boys to \"be [her] dogs.\" The kids will do anything, the teachers can't look away, and Partridge shows the kind of love that lets parents pull one child out of the throng and call it special, when he sings, \"Your school uniform looks grey on others but silver on you.\" When I first found the song, in an even rougher demo where you can't make out the lyrics, I actually thought Partridge was singing about his own daughter. Instead, he tells us that \"I'm glad your father is my friend/ And now that school is at an end/ He's only an excuse for me to wait here at your palace gates.\" In that sense, this is a Lolita song. But it's also the purest Lolita song ever recorded. In spite of the reference to The Police's \"Don't Stand So Close To Me\", Partridge sings about the girl without lust: He's observing her from afar, celebrating her sexuality without molesting it, and what you hear in his voice is pride. And though I was wrong about his being the dad, the mistake makes more sense if you listen to the song that best complements this one Wasp Star's \"Playground\", on which his real daughter sings regal backup vocals. If you spend enough time with Partridge's demos, you realize he's thrown away better songs than most people have written. He only doles out a few of them on each Warbles discs, but six discs in, it's still enough for fans to remain interested, try to figure out why he left them out, analyze what they can tell us about Partridge, and more than anything to play with them ourselves, at home, projecting our own song cycles onto these scraps.
