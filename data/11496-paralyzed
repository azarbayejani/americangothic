{"label":" Tee Pee","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/11263/homepage_large.919a7dc5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"Witch","title":"Paralyzed","text":" To paraphrase Brandon Stosuy's review of Witch's debut album, stoner/doom metal fans will likely find Witch which features Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis on drums fun, if hardly original. When these side endeavors become ongoing concerns, however, they lose some of their inherent charm especially if, like Witch, they're doing what lots of other groups have already done. And so Paralyzed might be harder and (in sound and in spirit) grungier, but it only goes to show that there's a world of difference between imitation and inspiration. As they did on their debut, Witch brazenly flog metal's standard sound and standard tropes: fast living, witchy women, bad trips, trippy mythmaking, and whatever other bummedout stereotypes they can pack and smoke. If the song's called \"Gone\" or \"Mutated\", you know what you're going to get. For the sake of convenience, they often stuff two or three of these themes into the same song the best is \"1000 MPH\", which envisions a crossroads where Deep Purple's \"Highway Star\" and White Zombie's \"Black Sunshine\" collide like lava lamp bubbles to form a zippy tune about a girl whose pedal is forever floored. That said, giving tracks ridiculously obvious names like \"Space God\" and \"Psychotic Rock\" begs the question of whether these guys are having fun or making fun. Regardless of intent, the sound of Paralyzed is an improvement on the group's eponymous offering. Producer Justin Pizzoferrato opts to move away from the clean, crisp backdrop Witch's John Agnello established. The lack of a \"Planet Caravan\"esque diversion (like \"Isadora\") might disappoint some the closest they come here to any sort of balladry is the thudding \"Sweet Sue\" but the decision to just rock straight on through complements Pizzoferrato's choices. Every track sits beneath a murky haze and welcome coat of fuzz to the endless parade of pitchperfect drum rolls and guitar solos.  Pizzoferrato's approach also takes attention away from Kyle Thomas' voice, which is a definite plus. I don't mean to unjustly knock Thomas' singing it's fine for what it is, and it's not like many stoner standard bearers were blessed with goldenthroated frontmen but placing his nasal moan front and center on Witch didn't do the group any favors. He has his lessthanflattering moments the raveup outro to \"Psychotic Rock\" being Exhibit A but otherwise he's perfectly serviceable. But therein lies part of the album's problem the needs serviced by Witch have been serviced plenty of times before. Unless you're a J Mascis completist, or are in desperate need for a watereddown stoner fix, Paralyzed is a wellintentioned bummer that should be left well enough alone.  "}
