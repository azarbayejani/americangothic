{"label":" Dopamine","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/816/homepage_large.f86031f3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Ott","artist":"Bluebird","title":"Black Presence","text":" Bluebird, like many indie bands today, labor under a sad delusion: that buried deep beneath their radioready emo façade, they've got their very own Kid A in the oven. The lightweight subFoo Fighters sunshine they've until now pawned off on teenagers nationwide is crime enough, but pimping a tiny Boston label to release this fatuous rehearsalroom indulgence takes otherwise innocent parties down with them.Black Presence is as painfully misled as its title, taken from a passage the bassist wrote and included (within quotes) in the liner notes. Apparently, \"Black Presence is death and life. It is the release that is pain and pleasure. It is pulling from the past and pushing into the future.\" Yeah, and I think it gives you +2 against Clerics and Mages. \"Future Burn\", the first complete song on this record, is mortifying, a brazen imitation of Radiohead's \"The National Anthem\". My stomach turns at the rationalization involved in releasing something so obvious \"Dude, dude, it doesn't sound that much like them, let's just add some vibraphone and stuff over it, make it our own thing.\" Five minutes of sonically lifeless keyboards follow, a dashedoff track they attempt to validate with an extremely long and dramatic song title: \"In the Presence of Opposition Persistence Prevails\". It goes without saying: these songs are all boring, late night stoner jams, and with no irony, Bluebird plop a Ray Manzarek keyboard solo in the middle of the next track, \"Wounded Kids\". Any pretense tied to the childish notion that process is inherently artistic is so far from Black Presence that light won't hit it for years. You can feel each drawnout moment as Bluebird try, and fail, to believe in what they're doing. \"Heaven's Dust\" began life as one of their few good ideas, and even the band recognizes it: they spend 6\\xBD minutes repeating the melody, stacking feedback and reverb plates in an effort to build something of substance. Instead, the results approximate teenagers who've just discovered Sigur Rós and decided to start a band. The only decent piece of music on this record its finale follows suit, but Bluebird's hitherto unchecked impulses are kept bay on \"Elegy for a Friend\", a simple, somber Yo La Tengo daydream whose greatest accomplishment, given its predecessors, is managing not to offend.
