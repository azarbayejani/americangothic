{"label":" Build","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/16802/homepage_large.cc1d72af.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Baobinga and Co.","title":"Joint Ventures","text":" Creatively, UK bass music can be a loner's game, but Baobinga has been doing things a little differently. Joint Ventures, the BristolviaManchester producer's new LP and the first one released on his Build label is crammed with so many collaborations, both unreleased and previously heard, that the artist credit lists \"Baobinga and Co.\" Baobinga's early material primarily featured snapping, neckwhipped breaks, but his run of creditsharing singles on Build has revealed a chameleonic streak. Joint Ventures shows just how well Binga plays with others. The slithering synth ride \"Heartburst Riddim\", with fellow Bristol lowend addict Ginz, deserves high marks right off the bat. Indeed, Joint Ventures reaches its highest highs when Binga teams with other artists from the city known for its sharply melodic \"purple\" style: Hyetal adds chaos to Binga's sweeping sound on \"Anything For Now\", while both sides of Build's latest single, Guido collab \"Ballin'\" b/w \"Bumba\", manage to evoke moonlit urban areas consisting of negative space, electricity, and precious little else. \"Wang It\", which features frequent collaborator I.D., is fun and punchy; less so is \"Barbakan\", a teamup with Manchester upandcomer xxxy that plays to neither artist's talents while steadily whirring along with a houseinflected groove. A few other cuts could have been shaved off of Joint Ventures' already daunting 76minute run time. While Untold's remix of Binga's \"Ride It\" is hard and technotunneled typical for the London producer it doesn't make much sense alongside the collection's vibrant, colorful tunefulness; Baobinga and Randomer's \"Crom2\" suffers a similar fate. Likewise, Rider Shafique collab \"Gun Talk\" is for fans only, and I'm not sure we needed Binga and I.D.'s remix of Roska's remix of \"Tongue Riddim\" (although it sounds pretty good nonetheless). Paradoxically, the most impressive turn on this guestpacked LP comes from Baobinga's only solo cut, \"Make Me Feel\", which sounds as if its clapping beat and unfurling layers of sensuous synths could go on for hours past its current four minutes and change. Yeah, friends are nice, but sometimes things work out even better when you do them by yourself. "}
