I say \"probably\" because I forget exactly how I felt approaching this Toronto sextet, but skepticism definitely factored in. The Diableros aren't a band you crack, at least not in a \"what's the password to this wireless network?\" way; but they do take some warming up to. First time I heard Pete Carmichael deliver \"Through the Foam\"'s ultrabanal lyrics in his trembling, jaundiced voice, it was offputting, obnoxious, not at all endearing. He seemed to be pleading the ages old neurosesascharacter defense to compensate for his lack of conventional vocal ability. Behind him, guitars running the gamut from thin and icy to fat and molten slug changes so unhurried and deliberate even Interpol could handle them. The drummer's happy enough to bash eighth notes into his new ride cymbal. Simple? Painfully so. Yet it adds up to a sound that's lush and inviting and rackety; like the best and strangest indie bands, the Diableros give the sense that they mean more than they play. And Carmichael's disheveled random firings thrive off the coolerheaded indie rock the band puts behind him. Ryan Dombal described this band as a lowbudget Interpol. Sonically, he observes correctly. The Diableros favor simple figures and big sounds: tidal waves of slowstrummed guitars, fat unflinching snare backbeats, and huge heldout organ drones. But humorless Interpol will never craft anything this tenacious.  If emotional eclecticism isn't your bag, steer clear. \"Sugar Laced Soul\" plows through more moods in three minutes than Antics did in 45. Carmichael is capable of delivering long streams of purplefaced bluster, but he almost whispers this one's precious opening salvo: \"Don't you know why people love one another?/ It's so they can feel their hearts beat together.\" Then surging drums turn the song from smarting ballad to heartloose anthem. Fastpicked, overreverbed guitars and hugely swelling organs give the song a surfrock energy, but Carmichael eventually ratchets back down to a teary croak. Two tracks later, \"Olympic Island\" starts up in like fashion, curtains of formless guitar jangle creating a washedout ambience, but this song is more hedged. The intro plays readysetbanana, building steam before recoiling into a drumless, twonote organ dirge. The dam only holds for a wink; ultimately more surging drums are needed to buttress the album's mantric lyric: \"You can't break the strings in our Olympic hearts.\"  Carmichael's lyrics tend to pop out at you in spurts, when he gets uppity or when the Farfisa stops droning. On \"Push It to Monday\", we hear just enough to understand why the titular rescheduling. As the song filters into a short, ascending prechorus, panic sets on: \"My car won't start I don't know what to do,\" he sings, sounding as if a neck vein isn't the worst thing he's set to lose.  Plenty of bands do the hysterical singer/banal subjects thing these days, most of them Canadian; but none push the contrast farther than the Diableros. Carmichael plays the part of the withering, artfully disheveled, colossally fuckedup vocalist as popularized by Win Bulter (Arcade Fire), Spencer Krug (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown), Alec Ounsworth (CYHSY), Hamilton Leithauser (Walkmen), and Paul Banks (Interpol). But he's less technically adroit than any of those bands' lead men less cool, too. Even Krug, crazed but always on his game, is just puttogether enough to impress not distress us. Listening to Pete Carmichael sing, meanwhile, is profoundly uncomfortable. You feel embarrassed hearing him fidget and freak out at nothing, mainly because we all fidget and freak out at nothing sometimes some of us all the time. But even in an age of bigdrama, highromance, unabashedtobeabashed vocalists, indie rock rarely admits to that. The Diableros don't retreat from their flaws, they make them sing, and by doing so teach us to embrace ours.  "}
