{"label":" Bpitch Control","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/410/homepage_large.fe1f0b03.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nick Sylvester","artist":"Ellen Allien","title":"Thrills","text":" Thrills rocks \"been there done that\" like a yearlong Berlin residency. Citykid Ellen Allien's through with fooling (Stadtkind), through with mindblowing, genredefiant, voxhappy mass appeal (Berlinette). Her new one's \"I'm making real techno now\" approach comes through loud/clear: no glitch, no ruse of song, straightup bangers off quaint analog, and the back to mine instant cred of her rare ARP 2600 purchase. So apparently Allien's serious now at the very least serious about seeming serious. The functional grind is brutal at first. Round one, Allien only goes down good when she sticks to trashscapes: \"Cloudy City\" cops bellhead drums and fries them 8bit, a disorienting groove that takes a minute for the head and arse not to look the same. \"She Is With Me\", same thing, though much prettier; this time the glitch is less programmatic the deep bass keychain sound FX synths get lost in echo, and accumulate, and collide. When Thrills finally makes sense it's a genre record, unconcerned with newness and interested primarily in dropping tight loops with welltempered size/movement gestures those songs we liked first stick out sore. They do, to my ear, sound less serious, next to Allien's Anthems. \"Come\", that mature leadoff track ready to explode but Victorian enough not to, never drops a snare. On the backend, \"Magma\" insists on minimal clicks and hums, the volume knob upped and downed with the guise of build surely to land itself on Fabriclive 30 between some Melchior throwback and a Senor Coconut track, remixed by Crazy Remixer Dude Nobody Actually Cares About. I guess there's merit there, but I'm not smiling; not dancing either. Am I bummed Allien's resigned herself to making just another serious techno record with but one memorable track? Am I bummed that said memorable track (\"The Brain Is Lost\") is only memorable because it sounds like Mu's \"Tiger Bastard\" and Output electrogoth shit in general? Do I think the fabulously titled \"Ghost Train\", which I would respect on name alone, is an excellent example of Allien accidentally insisting her halffinished tracks are, in fact, stubborn loops that I should approve of on grounds of build and confidence, instead of bemoaning their monochromaticism and lack of ambition? Why is \"Naked Rain\" not as cheeky as it should be? Not that all simple things need to be more complex, nor do heavy things need better larfs, but yeah: I do miss Allien's playfulness. What I get from Thrills is not a natural outgrowth but a conscious break from her own musical trajectory not to mention Bpitch in general, however much either has been dictated by other musicians (Apparat, Smash TV). She's onto some good shit here, but there's too much learning on the job. "}
