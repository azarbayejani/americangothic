{"label":" Asthmatic Kitty","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16077/homepage_large.a125f8bc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Patrick Sisson","artist":"Prefuse 73/Jaytram/Epstein","title":"Prefuse 73/Jaytram/Epstein","text":" Reissues usually connote a repackaging and reappraisal of a classic or the reintroduction of something buried or overlooked. Asthmatic Kitty's campaign last year to rerelease producer Roberto Carlos Lange's work as Epstein appeared less like a revelation than a gentle reminder of something unintentionally misplaced in the decade's deluge of music. The BrooklynbywayofFlorida beatmaker and sound artist isn't exactly an unknown. He's released albums as Helado Negro, participated in Guillermo Scott Herren's Savath y Savalas project, produced Bear in Heaven's latest album, and collaborated with Juliana Barwick, among other projects. But the splicedtogether sections of Epstein compositions on this remix disc make a case for revisiting that particular part of his back catalog, an eclectic one filled with dusty, laidback beats and the occasional lyricism of jazz, like the trumpet on \"Y Entonces\". Herren teamed up with Jason \"Jaytram\" Trammell, Yeasayer's drummer as well as a past collaborator on Epstein records, to reappropriate and reshape Epstein's sound collages. While his band is known for kinetic and multilayered production, Jaytram's contributions often feel suspended, viscous melodies with samples stretched like taffy. \"You Know They Out\" gingerly steps forward, woozy and lightheaded, while \"Haunted Hotel Beat\" starts with a bulbous sample from \"Needed\" before lurching forward with halfspeed swagger. The slightly tense \"Joy Me\" propelled in part by the choppedup bassline from \"Sin Pueblo\", off 2005's Gente Sin Pueblo is topped off with the gorgeous vocals of \"A Lost Animal\" provided by Alejandra and Claudia Deheza from the School of Seven Bells. Herren and Lange's shared history in Savath y Savalas isn't as evident on the Prefuse 73 remixes. Herren leans toward his shortattentionspan style rather than his more Iberian, folktronica work, and tracks like the brief \"Mar del Enfermo Abrazos\" seem to corkscrew in on themselves. Granted, Herren could graft together any number of shapeshifting compositions from a handful of random albums, but it's a credit to Lange's range that Herren doesn't seem bored or limited by the source material. None of the remixes on Prefuse 73/Jaytram/Epstein come off as revelatory, and actually they may make a better case overall for the originals than themselves, especially Jaytram's, which breathe enough to provide clearer glimpses of Epstein's work. It's always telling to see yourself through your friend's eyes, and while the raw material isn't immediately recognizable, it will definitely make some curious. "}
