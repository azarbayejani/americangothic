{"label":" Sub Pop","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/467/homepage_large.72d8d7be.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Sam Ubl","artist":"A-Frames","title":"Black Forest","text":" AFrames foresee the end of the world, and they seem to relish it. On \"Black Forest II\", drummer/vocalist Lars Finberg enumerates Armageddon's casualties with a hint of contented zeal: \"No people, no trucks, no cars/ No movies, no TV stars/ Humanity is erased/ Black Forest left in its place.\" Sure, it's a bit heavyhanded, but musically they keep it short and sweet: The best of Black Forest's 14 tracks are usually a done deal 'ere the twominute bell strikes. Actually, the album would be better if it, too, was kept on the short side. Like fellow dystopiadwellers Liars and Fire Show, AFrames prefer a sustained din to an expansive roar. Black Forest tends to drone, which is okay when AFrames remember to bring the riffs. Among the songs that include a melodic counterpoint to the band's combination of jaundiced electronics and sludgy bass is \"Experiment\", which waits for the pitch then slugs it into the bleachers with a flickofthewrist guitar hook. \"Galena\" pounds a seesawing bass/drums vamp before breaking form to deliver a brusque but satisfying chorus. Throughout its exciting yet repetitive first half, such wellplaced, melodious turnabouts are Black Forest's saving grace they affirm the album's aesthetic by temporarily breaking with it. Those breaks aren't as prevalent on the LP's brooding second side. Starting with \"Quantum Mechanics\", the album sounds like an undeveloped skeleton of its first half. \"Memoranda\" is muted, stiff, and lacks the gorilla lowend that buttresses even the band's weakest numbers. \"Negative\" carries far too much bass racket and comes off like malcontent Icarus Line. On Side B, only \"My Teacher\" with its ticktock bass line, mottled spokenword lyrics, and almostdub clicks and rolls interrupts the clangor. \"Age of Progress\" the second set's strongest track follows, and it's both the dankest, dirtiest thing AFrames have ever recorded and an interesting sound for them to explore in the future. At their best, AFrames evoke a halfdigested Pop Group. (They spared themselves the other half to leave room for melody.) This approach could take off if the band keeps sight of the details and don't let its songs linger. But here AFrames teeter on the line between consistency and monotony, falling mostly on the former side their endless doomsaying can grow tiresome but more often it's fun to play along. Even perdition can seem appealing when it's paired with a killer hook or two. "}
