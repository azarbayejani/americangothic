It should therefore surprise no one (or at least, not me) that the second annual compilation of amourabsorbed covers from Starbucks' Hear Music affiliate features a handful of artists from the less challenging, safer side of indie music, each giving performances that even Pitchfork grandparents could deem inoffensive. It's all bound by a theme, of course: On Sweetheart 2005, love isn't just blind; it's also morbid, disjunctive, selfabnegating, strangely fearful, and allimportant. Plus, it lasts forever. Just in time for Valentine's Day! Neko Case gives the album's most exceptional performance, sashaying through a faithful rendition of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks classic \"Buckets of Rain\" with her usual aplomb. \"Life is sad, life is a bust,\" she sings, and it's this awareness that makes the narrator's miserable adoration particularly affecting. Calexico tackles an even darker masterpiece, \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", though their stately altcountry leanings inevitably lack Joy Division's urgency. Joseph Arthur tries his hand at The Smiths' \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\", but his slowing of the tempo and Americanization of the melody just mires Morrissey's blithely maudlin lyrics in unnecessary bathos. Meanwhile, Jim White's \"Use Me\", originally by Bill Withers, celebrates a love of the unhealthy variety (\"keep on usin' me till you use me up\"). Gary Jules adds unnecessary drums and synths to Cat Stevens' tonguetied acoustic beauty \"How Can I Tell You\"; another Teaser and the Firecat track, the mournful \"If I Laugh\", might have been a better fit.Sweetheart includes a few more traditional love songs, too. M. Ward demonstrates his gift for crafting earthy indie folk out of 80s excess, this time giving the \"Let's Dance\" treatment to Pete Townshend's cheesy but endearing \"Let My Love Open the Door\". Simply put, it's excellent. And frequent collaborators Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips turn in an arguably better \"Forever\" than Full House's Uncle Jesse, even if theirs somehow evokes \"Pomp and Circumstance\" more than the Beach Boys' Sunflower original did. Martina TopleyBird, Rufus Wainwright, Milton Mapes, Sondre Lerche, and Old 97's add a few unremarkable stabs at standards (\"My Funny Valentine\") and possible future standards (the Kinks' \"She's Got Everything\", Matthew Sweet's \"Your Sweet Voice\"). Of course, if, as Lisa Simpson once observed, romance has been acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney, it was only a matter of time before Starbucks got in on the act as well. "}
