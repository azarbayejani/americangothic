The album sounded distinctly UK while offering an alternative to grime's allsystemsgo formula, thanks in large part to beats that ranged from Kanye Weststyle speed soul to Rick Rubinesque Marshall stack bap. And at the center was Kano, a naturally alluring vocalist smooth enough to calm nerves and smart enough to act like himself in a genre teeming with poseurs and hucksters. \"I can't be bothered with bars or weed/ I'd rather spit 16 bars for P's,\" he admitted on one of the album's many nerdy and honest lines about his superior work ethic. But the CD didn't quite break through to the British mainstream and it was never granted a release in the U.S., the home of most of Kano's musical heroes. On the recent mixtape cut \"Layer Cake\", the rapper bemoaned his slepton plot: \"I'm in the industry, man/ In Engaland/ Where I never sell more than an indie band.\" He tries to remedy his hohum sales and bolster his rep with London Town, a scattershot sophomore record that replaces his appealing selfconscious anxiety and innocence with hollow angst, slackened intensity, and Damon Albarn. Opener \"The Product of My Environment\", with its Cside beat and typical allusions to dead bodies makes London Town's chief dilemma clear: Kano is confused as to whether he should rap about what he knows or what he thinks the masses want to hear. While Home Sweet Home found an exceptional balance between the Brit's street and pop sides, Kano decided to separate his split personality this year, relegating his harder edge and several highquality original beats to a recent, vastly superior mixtape. This leaves his commercial side to run rampant on the new album, and it makes for an infinitely frustrating mash.  While the girl at the center of \"Bad Boy\" might be a bit more reserved than your typical hiphop clubdweller (\"I know you ain't easy,\" raps Kano), the song eventually dissolves into an inanity that once seemed below this MC: \"I'm strictly on chicks, chicks, chicks/ In the back of the taxi or in the bedroom I give 'em the dick, dick, dick.\" Ugh. This stands in crass contrast to Home's brilliant ballads, \"Nite Nite\" and \"Brown Eyes\", which bypassed mere dick waving for surprisingly mature ambiguities and vulnerability. This subtler, wiser Kano shows up briefly on single \"This Is the Girl\", a massive, synthdriven rap&b ode to not having sex with groupies. On the song, forgotten twostepper Craig David fits perfectly in between the rapper's monogamy tribulations, helping \"Girl\" become one of London Town's few fangrabs that truly connects.  Located in the dead center of the album, \"Fightin' the Nation\" and \"Feel Free\" bring things to a disconcerting halt with their gasbag morality screeds. A corny, acoustic guitardriven interpolation of Junior Murvin's \"Police and Thieves\", \"Nation\" sets up a manipulative tale of urban strife that could offer only specks of originality to those completely unfamiliar with hiphop. \"Daddy don't exist such a clich√© these days,\" rhymes Kano, basically calling out his own bullshit midverse. \"If I ain't usin' my status to make a change I ain't ever makin' hits,\" he claims later, but the line comes off as insincere from an MC so obviously flailing for a hit of any sort, no matter its moral standing. If nothing else, it proves once again that using fauxconscious, sampleheavy tracks as a chart bid is a loselose. \"Feel Free\" might be even less effective. On it, Kano rides a subGorillaz instrumental and emptily blathers about cleaning up communities while Damon Albarn picks his brain for a placeholder \"la la la\" hook. Bottom line: One Talib Kweli is (more than) enough.  \"I need to find some inspiration before I'm fed up with this,\" says Kano near the end of the album, referring to the business of making music. On London Town, he sounds frighteningly uninspired and shouldershrug fedup. At 22, he's already looking back to the days when rapping was fun on \"Me & My Microphone\". Now, though, as songs like \"Over & Over\" and \"Sleep Tight\" attest, Kano doesn't sound like he's enjoying himself too much. It's a shame. When I talked to the rapper before his debut was released two years ago, he all but predicted his current predicament: \"You can never really top the first time, but we'll see how it goes.\" Somewhere between Most Overlooked and Most Disappointing lies a man trying to sell records by turning into a stretchedthin schizo. \"Write my own bars so if I flop it's on me,\" he says. At least we know whom to blame.  "}
