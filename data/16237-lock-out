We had JayZ and Kanye, Eminem and Royce Da 5'9\", and of course Gucci Mane, who released two major label duo albums the disappointing Ferrari Boyz with Waka Flocka Flame and the bizarre BAYTL with Kreayshawn associate VNasty. This time out, Waka pairs with French Montana, who has worked extensively with the currently imprisoned Max B, formally of the Harlem based Byrdgang. Coming from Atlanta by way of New York City, Waka's energetic and aggressive style has endured longer than most probably would have suspected. When he released his first single, \"O Let's Do It\", he was mostly known as the guy standing in the shadows of old Gucci Mane and OJ Da Juiceman videos. French Montana has been around for a few more years than Waka in the New York mixtape circuit, but last year's \"Choppa Choppa Down\" and his most recent single, \"Shot Caller\", got him signed to Bad Boy Records and got his name out there nationwide.  Given the players, you might expect Lock Out to be an East Coast rap affair, but with a couple of exceptions (the bouncy seriousness of \"Dat All\" and the triumphant finale of \"Promise\"), the tape sounds wellgrounded in the streets of Atlanta. The production on Lock Out is handled mostly by two producers with whom Waka has worked extensively (Southside and Lex Luger), alongside other lesserknowns who share an appreciation for dark, brooding beats that are, ultimately, pretty hard to distinguish from one another. The first half of the tape finds French Montana struggling to find his footing as his flow reduces songs to a slow creak, while Waka affirms his ability to rip any rap instrumental he comes across. \"1230\" has a great opening verse by Waka, and he delivers one of the strongest hooks on the mixtape, but the momentum that track builds is lost as soon as French appears, as he just cannot keep up with Waka's pace.  French Montana does have a few moments like \"Call It Dat\", a rare track where they display an equal amount of intensity. The same goes for \"We Mobb\" featuring Prodigy, where French sounds right at home and Waka shows going back to his New York roots can work, as they rap over the beat from Mobb Deep's vintage \"Hell on Earth\". But the more you hear the mixtape, the more you wish they'd found a better middle ground. The first single from Waka's upcoming album, \"Round of Applause\", produced by Lex Luger, is a great slice of Atlanta strip club music in the vein of Travis Porter, and it's a good match for French's style, since it would allow him to relax his flow a bit. French's recent hit single \"Shot Caller\" is a jazzy New York cut that could use a regional expanding verse energy ball verse from Waka to give it more radio and club appeal. On these songs, you get a better sense of why they'd want to work together, but Lock Out never comes close to that promise. "}
