{"label":" Stones Throw","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/17234/homepage_large.d6ad8107.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"M.E.D.","title":"Classic","text":" M.E.D. is the rap equivalent of a middlerelief pitcher asked to go eight innings. He's left his mark in small doses on Madlibproduced tracks Lootpack's \"Level Zero\" and \"Wanna Test\"; Quasimoto's \"247\"; Madvillain's \"Raid\" but his 2005 fulllength debut Push Comes to Shove revealed his limitations in short order. He's never been the most distinguishable member of the Stones Throw camp, for good or for bad: The same thing that's kept him from setting himself apart has also generally kept him from the embarrassments that happen when an MC's ambition outstrips his inspiration. He just punches the clock, drops in for 14 tracks, then punches out again, rapping like a man who keeps his head down and just goes through the motions, as though doing otherwise would get him fired. That the title is the most egregious thing about Classic is something of a minor relief, though it's also a good way to bait critics looking for something else to say about an album without much personality to it. (I'll bite: \"more like Adequate.\") The usual themes come up in his lyrics sex (\"JWF\"), weed (\"Medical Card\"), regional pride (\"Where I'm From\") and the common universality of his experiences and perspectives on these wellworn topics are relatable at the expense of being actually unique. Occasionally he'll hit on something like \"Blaxican\", which conflates the parallel civil rights struggles in his background, and leaves you wondering just what more he might have to say outside the confines of his indistinct lyrical style. But it's M.E.D.'s emphasis on technique over everything else that holds this album back. His voice is largely flat and affectless, letting the words do all the work of selling an attitude that should otherwise come through in inflections. And those words don't carry enough weight on their own; there's so much reliance on internal rhymes and assonance in his style that he's sacrificed being quotable for being listenable. But he's at least got a delivery that fuses well to the beat and doesn't get in the way of the production enough to detract from it sometimes, it's the other way around, as when a sampled vocal drop on closer \"Magical Mystical\" actually drowns him out midverse. (By that point, it's hard to feel like you've missed something.) In situations like this, it's best to approach an album at this level as a sort of beat tape with added vocal augmentation. A lot of Classic's appeal comes from the heavy Madlib involvement, and his productions here work well as a tidiedup take on the resincaked density of his latterday Medicine Show and Beat Konducta entries. The Teslacoil keyboards of Kurupt/Planet Asiafeaturing subwoofer anthem \"Roll Out\" and the strippeddown, dirtiedup drums on Hodgy Beats collab \"Outta Control\" are key highlights. For good measure you can throw in a tensionbuilding violintinged Alchemist beat on \"War & Love\", Oh No delivering nobullshit choppy organ funk on \"Where I'm From\", Karriem Riggins wringing some nice belated summer vibes off the jazz guitardriven title track, and Georgia Anne Muldrow injecting her eccentric but richly realized neosoul sensibility into \"INT'L\". It's another solid case study in what makes the Stones Throw aesthetic so appealing to the traditionalistmeetsfuturist indierap crossover crowd. That sound just has a lot of blanks to fill in: The MC shortened his name from Medaphor to an acronym a long time ago, but it's still not clear whether M.E.D. actually stands for anything. "}
