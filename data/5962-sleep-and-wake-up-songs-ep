The band named for a river outside St. Petersburg, Russia filled last year's eyeopening Down the River of Golden Dreams with gentle ballads about beds and war criminals and forgiveness, but the songs on their followup EP, Sleep and Wake Up Songs, are more brittle and fragile, like a light sleeper's snooze. The EP condenses the album's best qualities and discards most of its weaknesses, and its brevity makes it all the more emotionally forceful. \"Rapt, in Star Wars sheets/ With my hand across your belly/ We waded through the watercolor,\" Will Sheff sings on opener \"A Favor\". The song hints at a life of sexual confusion and parental abandonment, hinging on a chorus that alludes to the impossibility of true human connection: \"I would be anything that you wanted me to be...but how can I change my body?\" Plumbing the disappointment of unrealized dreams, these songs are bleak and often desperate. They traffic in deliberately nebulous narratives unnamed characters, unspecified relationships, vague actions, undisclosed emotions anchored by concrete details. The result is a dreamlike atmosphere, simultaneously blurred and lucid. \"You're Untied Again\" turns the adage \"if you love something, set it free\" on its head, but Sheff is more interested in evoking the chill of an unreachable beach or the darkness of a diamond mine both of which become potent metaphors for the confinement of a relationship. With an acoustic guitar melody as prismatic as melting icicles, \"Just Give Me Time\" plumbs the tension at the heart of a relationship, but the lyrics are so opaque as to be coded: \"I shut my eyes, ripped the train off the line/ But a sudden gust of snow blew through a hole in my girl's clothes.\" This is not necessarily a criticism: refusing to provide much context for their narratives, these songs are guardedly confessional, eager to elicit emotions but hesitant to reveal too much. To compliment this mood, the instruments sound sleepily languid, lolling around the beat rather than hitting it precisely. \"A Favor\" builds gradually to a climax reminiscent of \"The War Criminal Rises and Speaks\" from Down the River of Golden Dreams, but only the vocals crescendo. The other instruments maintain the same volume, as if nonplussed by Sheff's display of emotion. As a result, the song's climax becomes airily anticlimactic, further emphasizing the sense of lonely futility described in the lyrics. Closing the EP, \"The Hidden Track\" sets up an intriguing musical metaphor: Life itself is an album, but the afterlife is the unlisted bonus song. After questioning and doubting himself throughout the song and suffering through what sounds like tremendous uncertainty Sheff admits, \"I think that there's a hidden track.\" The song provides an upbeat coda to match his hopefulness, then the EP abruptly and unceremoniously ends.
