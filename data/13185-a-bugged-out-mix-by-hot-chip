{"label":" New State","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/14183/homepage_large.a1d8a264.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andrew Gaerig","artist":"Hot Chip","title":"A Bugged Out Mix","text":" Perhaps mimicking the structure of your average iTunes playlist, Hot Chip's entry in the Bugged Out mix series, commissioned by the UK dance party organization of the same name, offers one disc of ringing, shuffling techno (Bugged Out) and another, more varied \"summer mix\" (Bugged In). The package presumably offers something for both esoteric dancefloors and somewhat less exclusive Julytime vibe fests, though the disjointed nature and the varying quality of the mixes makes the Bugged Out package a bit of a headscratcher.Bugged Out plays more confrontational and pounding than might be expected from a group last seen translating Half Nelson/Willie Nelson gags into electrosoul balladry. It's tempting, too, to question the utility of the mix, which is only minimally (no pun intended) dancey, exhibits only sporadic interest in proper transitions, and features plenty of knuckledover faves. Gas smoothes the opening minutes; Preverlist's \"Junktion\" strangles a middle section; Gabriel Ananda and Dominik Eulberg's \"Eucalypse Now!\" pounds near the end (there's also a track here by Pitchfork contributor Philip Sherburne). Three minutes of an exclusive Hot Chip track, \"Take It In\", offers a minor incentive. The track rumbles darkly, Alexis Taylor's easy vocals skinning over its carving bass; a nice treat, but rightly exiled in compilation/Bside/mix territory.The mix does pick up some steam, climaxing with the wordless, hazy house of Ican's \"Chiclet's Theme\" before starting slowly, steamily downhill. Closing the set at more than eight minutes, Max Cooper's \"I (Long Version)\" is a bit of a trek (most tracks clock in between two and four minutes), but the hints of optimism buried in its ruby synths are a fine note to close on. Ultimately, Bugged Out camps in the purgatory between \"actual tastemaking dance mix\" and \"an interesting mix by artists you enjoy,\" though any indierockin' Hot Chip fans looking to explore the engine that propelled \"Ready for the Floor\" might find something to explore here.The wildcard second mix (Bugged In), on the other hand, isn't as concerned with form or function, earning its seasonal peg with a nearschizophrenic but always warming mix of balmy techno, smooth rock, and fluttery other. The set begins abstractly, with the curators' remix of the Pictish Trail's \"Winter Home Disco\" (hell, just ignore the title) but quickly burns through calypso (the Andrews Sisters' unskippable \"Rum & Coca Cola\"), hammering techno (GrecoRoman Soundsytem's \"Party Rhythm\"), and utter oddity (the Esso Trinidad Steel Band's take on the Kinks' \"Apeman\") before settling into the windchime lull of Osborne's \"16th Stage\". From there Bugged In rolls Man Like Me's \"London Town\" into Fleetwood Mac's \"Love in Store\", whose 8thnote thrum seems like a natural continuation of \"16th Stage\".There are some hokey choices we probably don't need the Doobie Brothers' \"What a Fool Believes\", and Dub Narcotic Sound System's \"Shake a Puddin'\" mucks up the momentum but even 1980s standards like Hall & Oates' \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\" and Luther Vandross' \"Never Too Much\" feel like natural, lightfunk choices (also, reexplore \"Just a Friend\" outside of a beer commercial). Sparks' \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" is such a natural antecedent to Hot Chip's dorkdisco that its inclusion feels obvious in hindsight.Bugged In's mix work is still a tad uneven, but no one on your rooftop, or in your Volkswagen, or between your ears will notice, because it plays well anywhere, a slick reminder of Hot Chip's charm and quirk. That it is, however slightly, weighed down by the darker clubroom thump of Bugged Out is responsible for the somewhat depressed score you see above. Make no mistake: Bugged In is worth your poolside July, and doubly so if you're likely to get anything more than \"oh, another decent mix\" out of Bugged Out. "}
