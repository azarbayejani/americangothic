Not that Super Furry Animals were the ones who needed to get theirs back, exactly. I mean, sure, 2007's Hey Venus! wasn't so much \"speaker blowing\" lead singer Gruff Rhys' advertisement as \"hey, SFA still don't suck yet.\" But before that, 2005's Love Kraft was a multilayered psychfunkfolksamba epic about love, war, and \"no more romantic comedies.\" Since then, the Welsh quintet's offbeat side projects such as Rhys's Deloreanthemed Neon Neon partnership with Boom Bip, or keyboardist Cian Ciárán's electronicleaning Acid Casuals have kept the Super Furry faithful wellsupplied.Dark days? Uhh, have you picked up a newspaper lately? Me neither, which I assume is part of the problem. \"People that go out and murder people don't read The Wall Street Journal,\" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the other day, on whether the shitty economy added to gun violence. And yet all of a sudden a lot of liberalartsdamaged hipsters seem to know a hell of a lot about the financial sector. Call it a capital infusion: SFA's ninth album in almost two decades as a band, Dark Days/Light Years, is also their most playful since 2001's Rings Around the World. Full of paradoxes and loving parodies, honeyed psychpop harmonies and shaggy vamps, it's just the scifi grooverock mindfuck to shake us out of our nofun times.First, the grooves: SFA assembled Dark Days/Light Years nine years in the making, 40 days in the recording largely out of riffs and ideas that for one reason or another had gone unused. The results are as freewheeling and inspired as the group has sounded in years Superer and Furrier. Heavy blooz schoolgirlballers from Grand Funk Railroad to Eric Burdon can keep their puds and their guts squeezed tight into their bellbottoms after opener \"Crazy Naked Girls\", a threepart song that reclaims wah wah and a whole lotta lovin'. Groove turns to stomp on Ciáránfronted \"Mt.\", which places Donovan folk mysticism over glamrock schaffel.Then, when the machines groove, it's motorik. The Super Furries meet the ensuing depression with... more wryness. \"Let us make the best of a difficult situation,\" Rhys intones on first single \"Inaugural Trams\", the album's top standalone track. In a utopian universe where it would've been politically feasible for President Obama to announce, upon his inauguration, a plan to reduce emissions (\"by 75!\") and restore the economy through a publictransportation moon race, \"Inaugural Trams\" with Franz Ferdinand's Nick McCarthy rapping some of the only German words I know that aren't \"Kraftwerk\" or \"hefeweizen\" would be the summer jam. If \"Inaugural Trams\" is \"the definitive krautrock song about railcars,\" as New York magazine's Vulture blog wondered recently, it's only in the way Rings Around the World's \"Juxtaposed With U\" was the definitive Philly soul sexx jam. In other words, it's something else.And it's not alone. Lester Bangs once recommended a young punk band call their album The Monkees' Greatest Hits; the biggest disappointment here is that the Super Furries didn't make \"The Very Best of Neil Diamond\" the title track. The song's ancient licks and sweaty percussion might suggest early 00s R&B, or some kind of Eastern thing, but far from it: The chorus of \"trust but verify\" swipes a favorite Cold War catchphrase of Ronald Reagan. Somewhere before the guitargnashing bridge, I guess there's also this narrative about a Neil Diamond tape playing in the aftermath of an apocalypse. (And I'm told you can hear quotes from Vivaldi and Beethoven in Metal Machine Music, too...) Right after \"The Very Best of Neil Diamond\" takes us to \"Sweet Caroline\" and back, \"Helium Hearts\" drops us off in Eden. With perfect hippiedippie non sequiturs about wedding rings, togetherness, and vegemite, it's probably the closest SFA's latest comes to the swooning, ELOlite psychpop of past highlights like 1996's \"Something 4 the Weekend\".Just because a band sticks to the oldfashioned idea of an album as a cohesive piece of work doesn't mean it has to get all stuffy about it: Dark Days/Light Years begins with casual chatter and ends, after the \"Beat It\" meets \"Livin' on a Prayer\" bass lines and burbling vocal nonsense of Ciáránpenned quasiinstrumental \"Pric\", with three minutes of droning electronic tones. (SFA have played this kind of prank before, burying career highlights on hidden tracks or nonalbum singles.) Guitarist Huw Bunford's \"White Socks/Flip Flops\" makes up in wet synths, blistering guitars, and taut rhythms what it lacks in fashion sense; fuzzed bassguitar duel \"Inconvenience\" not an Au Pairs cover goes from \"what the fuck?\" to jihad and pirate ships (timely!). Even the least exceptional tracks here, twinned songs \"Where Do You Wanna Go?\" and \"Lliwiau Llachar\", still offer raucous drumming and catchy Welshlanguage vocals.Remember when columnists predicted the death of irony after 9/11? Didn't happen, but between the whole everybodylosingtheirjobs thing and having an actual wellmeaning grownup in the White House, deadly seriousness is more of a threat now than ever. At least there's Glenn Beck. In the meantime, Dark Days/Light Years brings some good vibes for everyone \"from middleaged sophisticates to stoneaged reprobates,\" to borrow a line from the rhythmically restrained, Spoonlike \"Moped Eyes\". It used to be called \"Hot Nuts\". "}
