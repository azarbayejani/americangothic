{"label":" Slumberland","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/16970/homepage_large.2b21148d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Big Troubles","title":"Romantic Comedy","text":" There's a great bit in Patton Oswalt's latest special that begins with him auditioning for the role of \"gay best friend\" and ends with a monkey explosively defecating on camera. Obviously, he got from Point A to Point B explaining how romantic comedy isn't even really an artistic genre so much as a strict format whose monetary success is predicated on telling people what they're getting and then giving them exactly what they want. While Romantic Comedy is too scrappy and bummedout for usage in cute montages anytime soon, Big Troubles' sophomore LP and first for Slumberland is still every bit as beholden to an overt sense of values: If 1990s indie revivalism gets you going like seeing Jennifer Aniston and some other dude find true love does, it's easy to imagine a tagline saying \"from the people who brought you the Pains of Being Pure at Heart and the producers from Brighten the Cornersâ€¦\" doing its riskfree aspirations justice. Those familiar with last year's superlofi Worry will certainly be taken aback by Big Troubles' sprucedup presentation, but it's hardly surprising: It's not like they could go much further into the red than they did on their selfproduced fuzzbomb of a debut. For the most part, they err on the bookish side of the Slumberland sound, dabbling in both U.S. and UK varietals of mopepop while producer Mitch Easter (Murmur, Let's Active) shows a steady hand letting the ringing guitar leads and Alex Craig and Ian Drennan's hushed vocals exist in a soft and appealing glow. But while I don't blame Big Troubles for reaching out to Easter, together they overshoot the mark and ultimately Romantic Comedy often feels like it's uncomfortable using language and volume more suitable for the library. Single \"Misery\" is certainly the pluckiest of the bunch and has inspired a few mentions of the Smashing Pumpkins, which is on point if you can find me the preAdore singles without the searing guitar work, cathartic lyrics, studio polish, or Jimmy Chamberlin on the drums. A nice majorthirds riff complementing a boyish, breathy vocal only gets you to the point of Silversun Pickups. It's a rare record of this sort that makes you think, \"If only they raged as hard as Belong does,\" but Romantic Comedy innocuously charms instead of breaking hearts or breaking anything really even the feedbacklaced, vaguely glammy \"Time Bomb\" can't achieve the kind of escape velocity required to get them out of sounding like a rock band that doesn't actually rock. Still, they're precocious songwriters who know from a good hook: If you can get past its title rhyming with \"bad world,\" \"Sad Girls\" is a exceedingly catchy Britpop genre exercise, though the big key change sounds like them pressing too hard for extra credit. Likewise, \"Softer Than Science\" and \"Never Mine\" have a gorgeous shimmer and propulsion that similarly gets over some remarkably rudimentary \"mine\"/\"mind\" rhyme schemes. I suppose you can find the economy of the lyrics to be endearing, but it makes their awkward attempt at purple social critique on \"Make It Work\" \"such little relevance in the perfumes of high culture\" sound like they might be making fun of the National or something. More typically, Romantic Comedy earns its title from Craig and Drennan's narrators mostly dealing with relationships that are ultimately doomed if they even get past the point of premature negation. It's perfectly fine for a half hour of commiseration or wish fulfillment for romantics who take their loneliness as evidence of their humanity: a treatise on the utter futility of heterosexual relations stems from a glossy magazine ad on \"She Smiles for Pictures\" (sort of a simplified, nonacademic version of Jawbox's \"Savory\"), \"Engine\" wistfully reminisces of afterschool heavy petting (sort of a simplified version of Death Cab's \"We Looked Like Giants\"), and \"Minor Keys\" goes metacritical in its study of pop's emotional manipulation (very much a simplified version of the Smiths' \"Rubber Ring\"). Of course, it's a bouncy piece of jangle pop referencing something other than itself, and that's Romantic Comedy writ small, appealing and in tune with admirable influences but ultimately lacking the sort of unpredictability or drama that can make these the songs that saved your life rather than reminiscent of ones that can.
