Imagine deconstructed Essential Logic aerosol burns (stuff that barely hung together in the first place!) with kazoo instead of horns or Beefheart played by Nautical Almanac. Midset with the aforementioned Nautical Almanac in 2005, a friend leaned over and said: \"Too free for me, man.\" Live at No Fun, I had the same thought for Fat Worm: no forward momentum, not much to grab. Only when I turned and started doing something else (drinking? talking?) could I start to follow. Same with the record in the background, Pregnant Babies Pregnant With Pregnant Babies sounds its addled best, like on \"Cicadas\", light on the pointless snare work and heavy on feedback insect calls and crunchy leaves under foot. Front and center, odds are your roommates will start yelling at you: \"Dude, what the fuck is that?\" or \"Yeah, I actually lived with one of those guys. Stuff is terrible.\"Pregnant Babies spends most of its time in between songs, but when they deign to appear they're sticky thirdeye narrative thrillers: \"Red Melting Plastic Box\", for instance, is a story about a picnic gone wrong, honey and ants everywhere; they take over a lunch box and live there. That transitions into \"LaissezFaire Is for the Birds\", in which pigeons come in, ruin the party, kill the ants, eat all the bread, and ride nature's chaos (gurgles, bird chirps, chords and choruses, the odd harmony) into triumph over mankind.  \"Brown\" and \"Hand of God\" make some sense, too: The former basically is a class rant (\"she's so sophisticated, get it?\"), and the latter's your standard antiChrist or whoever (\"the skin of God is dry and flaking\") song, set to pick and string drags. Fat Worm of Error have a couple people who used to play in Deerhoof, and they've developed their own version of that band's unpredictability and kiddiemoan, except here set in Western Massachusetts and devoid of the presumption of an audience. Like kids, their alternate universe is addictive when you're in it. But mostly you're out of it, it's threerowsback noise on a plane, and you can't sleep. "}
