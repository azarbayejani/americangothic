{"label":" Dicristina","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13341/homepage_large.19e42822.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Matthew Murphy","artist":"Matteah Baim","title":"Death of the Sun","text":" Since most artists are understandably reluctant to have their work labeled and/or categorized, it seems natural to be skeptical when Matteah Baim preemptively dubs her debut solo album \"new age grunge.\" What's more discouraging is the slow realization that the music on Death of the Sun isn't even quite as intriguing as Baim's descriptive red herring implies. Instead, the first album from the nonCocoRosie half of Metallic Falcons continues with some of that project's more spacious and atmospheric lullabies, but relies too often on wispy songs and melodies that appear to evaporate before reaching the ground.CocoRosie's Sierra CasadyBaim's befeathered cohort in Metallic Falconsmakes no appearance here, but several other artists from the duo's shared orbit make contributions, including Devendra Banhart, Jana Hunter, and Pit Er Pat's Rob Doran. As with the Falcons' mesmeric 2006 debut Desert Doughnuts, however, Death of the Sun seems to have far fewer fingerprints on it than it actually does. On these nine tracks, Baim frequently sets her rich, transfixing vocals adrift into an uncertain nearsilence, with the assembled musicians playing their instruments so lightly it can seem as though they're attempting to not startle a skittish herd of antelope. Despite the album's brief 30minute running length, this ethereal production and somnambulant performance leaves the listener with the unshakable impression that Baim simply didn't have enough topshelf material to yet sustain a fulllength album.As it stands, Death of the Sun is two songs and nearly ten minutes finished before Baim conjures her first truly memorable melodic turn on \"Wounded Whale\", a hushed (natch) ecological lament that empties into the restrained psychfolk of the title track. Before the album can build upon this cautious momentum, Baim then digresses into a narcoleptic and completely superfluous version of the traditional \"Michael Row the Boat Ashore\", which is the type of performance that might work magic when actually gathered around the fire at a desert campsite maybe but almost certainly nowhere else. Baim recovers nicely with the spooky, flittering vocal harmonies of \"Seven Stars\" and \"Who Loves\", yet even these lovely pieces can seem halffinished and almost weightlessly ephemeral, their gauzy melodies always tantalizingly out of reach.Baim and her group finally take the shackles off and turn the volume up slightly on the album closing \"Up is North\". Though it's still a far cry from grunge of any variant, the drums do at last provide a satisfying punch while reverberant acid guitar figures encircle Baim's wraithlike vocals, punctuating the album's submerged themes of loss and recovery. And while the moment lasts, Death of the Sun seems a valuable new refraction of the Metallic Falcons' \"soft metal\" soundscapes, one that perhaps can eventually inspire Matteah Baim to truly develop new genres worth naming.
