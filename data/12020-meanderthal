{"label":" Hydra Head","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/12139/homepage_large.ded7fcdf.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"Torche","title":"Meanderthal","text":" After establishing themselves as fine purveyors of metallic sludge over the course of an album and an EP, Torche's second fulllength, Meanderthal, refines their penchant for volume and proves that there's more in their bag of tricks than Melvinslike metal. The record kicks off at a breakneck pace with a halfdozen tarthick tracks. The fleetfingered math of \"Triumph of Venus\" gives way to the triumphant bombast of \"Grenades\", a track that's barely finished before \"Pirha√±a\"'s stop/start stomp kicks into gear. Through these six songs including \"Sandstorm\", \"Speed of the Nail\", and \"Healer\" nothing necessarily feels out of the ordinary when compared to what Torche have done in the past.The hard left turn and perhaps the breaking point with \"true\" metal dudes comes with \"Across the Shields\", a tune that could find a nice home on modern rock radio. Musically, the group finds a comfortable middle ground between their speed trials and more turgid pace, allowing Steve Brooks' militant holler usually more reminiscent of Helmet's Page Hamilton to take on a melodic bent that could bring to mind anyone from Dave Grohl to Jawbox's J. Robbins. There's even an honesttogoodness hook: \"I am your armor,\" Brooks sings as the guitars descend. The moment stands out due to producer (and Converge guitarist) Kurt Ballou; the crisp sheen he lends to Torche's sound makes everything stand out and shimmer.Torche follow that breakthrough with a second half that contains a quick and clean 30second instrumental (\"Little Champion\"), more catchy hitandrun slabs (\"Sundown\", \"Without a Sound\"), and a thunderous onetwo punch (\"Amnesian\", \"Meanderthal\") to finish an album that shows Torche spreading their wings and exploring new territory while still creating their heaviest music yet. It's a fitting sendoff to an absolutely killer rock record one that's likely to appeal to listeners into any stripe of heavy music from the past 20 years. "}
