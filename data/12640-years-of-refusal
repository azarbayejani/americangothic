{"label":" Lost Highway","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13152/homepage_large.717b66a5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tom Ewing","artist":"Morrissey","title":"Years of Refusal","text":" Last time we saw Morrissey, on a rather slapdash Greatest Hits compilation, he was singing a song called \"All You Need Is Me\" and promising \"You'll miss me when I'm gone.\" Neither proposition seemed watertight: His 2000s return to action had been welcome but rarely spectacular, and the man looked set on a twilit career of gently diminishing returns. So Years of Refusal comes as a gratifying shock: It's his most vital, entertaining, and savage record since 1994's Vauxhall and I. What's surprising is that so little seems different. The personnel are largely unchanged: backing band the Tormentors and cowriters including old hands Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte. The approach is unchanged: muscular rock with plenty of room for Morrissey to roam and gesture and half an ear on live performance. Even some of the songs are unchanged: the new tracks from Greatest Hits show up again, though \"All You Need Is Me\" is transformed by context surrounded by fine new songs, you notice its snarl, flamboyance, and garage rock grind. Rather than try and reinvent himself, Morrissey has rediscovered himself, finding new potency in his familiar arsenal. Morrissey's rejuvenation's most obvious in the renewed strength of his vocals. On the barnstorming opener, \"Something Is Squeezing My Skull\", he switches from fruity to fierce with impeccable timing the ringing leaps up the scale on \"skull,\" the matteroffact checklist of drugs and mental treatments, and then the break into anger and desperation: \"How long must I stay on this stuff?\" On his old album sleeves, Morrissey would sometimes capitalize stray phrases for particular emphasis these days, when he wants to make a point, you hear those capitals. By \"Skull\"'s ferocious closing he should have won stray fans back, and he keeps the energy levels high across most of the record. Much of the album was tracked live in the studio, and their leader's vigor seems to have rubbed off on the band. Not only do the songs have a snappy ferocity, they're full of unexpected touches in the arrangement the discordant keyboards on \"Mama Lay Softly on the Riverbed\", or the codmariachi flourishes on \"One Day Goodbye Will Be Farewell\". This makes Years of Refusal a rarity a Morrissey record you can dig into without caring much about the man's lyrics. When you do pay attention to the words, Morrissey is on typically quotable form. He long ago got into the habit of paring his lyrics down into aphorisms \"You don't like me but you love me/ Either way you're wrong\" which run the risk of sounding too pat and polished: The source of much of the \"selfparody\" flak that flies his way. There's plenty of sigfile fodder here, but it's balanced by more startling imagery: \"I've hammered a smile across this pasty face of mine\"; \"I was a small fat child in a welfare house\"; and perhaps his most eyebrowraising couplet ever: \"The motion of taxis excites me when you peel it back and bite me.\" For much of Years of Refusal Morrissey is turning his fire outwards taking on lovers, enemies, wannabes, or some combination of all three. On \"The Last Time I Saw Carol\", his younger admirer winds up dead and Morrissey responds with detached regret. On \"You Were Good in Your Time\" he paints a mournful and wandering picture of a dwindled hero he knows and you know he's selfaware enough to be singing partly about himself. But only partly: This is Morrissey's most venomous, scoresettling album, and in a perverse way that makes it his most engaging. Fitting then that Years of Refusal's peak is its angriest track: \"It's Not Your Birthday Anymore\" starts tender, but something callous is stewing beneath its padding drums and gentle croon. \"Did you really think we meant all those syrupy sentimental things that we said?\" sings Morrissey, before the song takes a still darker turn into grudgeful, violent sexuality. In its cruelty and intensity, it's a cousin to Pulp's \"This Is Hardcore\", and it's the most disturbing, gripping Morrissey track since 1994's \"Speedway\". Even though the album dies away after \"Birthday\", it and its more raucous predecessors suggest an artist as pugnacious, confident, and necessary as he's ever been. "}
