You've just spent anywhere from $15$30 U.S. on Com Lag. You cradled it all the way home, flipping the exquisitely designed creamandink digipak end on end until you were completely certain it was real. You held it up to your nose as you slit the shrinkwrap, breathing deep the vacuumsealed polystyrene fumes, as close to the band as you'll ever get. Awed by ambitious packaging to rival The Soul Cages, you tenderly loosed the liner booklet from its pocket, fumbling with the pages as if sudden movement would reduce them to carbon. Gingerly, you rocked the disc back and forth to wrest it from its clear tray, trembling, breathless, in the event that, for the first time in recorded history, the CD's plastic center would pop out on your index finger, the most unholy wedding band imaginable. After dustblasting your player with compressed air, you slowly set Com Lag into the drawer on a perfect horizontal plane, ensuring zero impact. Positioning yourself at the triangulated stereo center of your equidistant speakers, you hear... *FFFFFFFFFFFFFT* *SSSSSSSSSSSHHHKKKKK* I can see the look on your face, and it is priceless. True to published reports, there's an appalling digital glitch on Com Lag, and as of press time, EMI Toshiba's position is that they will not recall this flawed limited edition EP. Our rating disregards the failing, since the butchered track in question Four Tet's otherwise palatable downtempo remix of \"Scatterbrain\" is available on the UK \"2 + 2 = 5\" single, and since the newly released Australian version of Com Lag is said to rectify the situation. But you can't ignore the humor behind 10,000 people shelling out $20 for what's basically a bad burn.Com Lag splits down the middle, a tentrack collection of demos, remixes and DSP experiments often less deserving of running time than meager Amnesiac leftovers like \"Fast Track\" and \"TransAtlantic Drawl\". Oddly, one of that era's most ornate Bsides, \"Fog\", is a highlight here, reprised in solo piano form for a television audience as per Yorke's justly lauded, widely booted sets for the 2002 Bridge School Benefit. Simplicity is this EP's virtue, as its pairing of \"Fog\" with a onetrack, acoustic recording of \"Gagging Order\" make for Com Lag's most valuable five minutes. Originally titled \"Move Along\", \"Gagging Order\" is a leftover from the aftermath of OK Computer; like many cherished and endlessly auditioned tracks from the unreleased Radiohead archives, the band never quite got this one right, and opted to punt. The steelwork is clearly influenced by the late John Fahey's selfdescribed \"American primitive guitar,\" and, coupled with primitive watercolor lyrics, lends as emotionally honest a view of Yorke and company since \"Exit Music\". I've got no prejudice against DSP or glitchpop, but Radiohead only seem to make it work half the time. When they do, though, the results are stunning enough to render the entire IDM landscape sterile which is why they continue to push these buttons. But as they built Hail to the Thief's robots, failed halfmachines like \"I Am Citizen Insane\" and \"Where Bluebirds Fly\" were thrown into the scrap heap, and for good reason. Both, however, are included here. \"Where Bluebirds Fly\", which served as intro music for Radiohead's 2003 tour dates, is a ponderous 4\\xBD minutes of drum machine stuttering and muted mumbling you may or may not remember as an anxious call to ears; \"I Am Citizen Insane\" churns in much the same way, a more monotonous and ambient loop song in which Thom's moans are replaced by Boards of Canadian children talking (in the background, natch). The three most traditional cuts here are sequenced upfront. An early, drumbacked demo of Hail to the Thief's solo guitar piece \"I Will\" offers very little to improve on the song's inherently thin premise, and the straightahead \"I Am a Wicked Child\" bears unfortunate resemblance to the Meat Puppets' \"Plateau\" (made worldfamous by Kurt Cobain a decade ago). For their bland aftertaste, neither can match the stolid \"Paperbag Writer\", which is, unbelievably, as artistically void as its title. A disjointed series of samples laid over the same stop/start glitch drums we're accustomed to, the tune's string hits and Tom Tom Club bassline never mesh with the familiarly cavernous reverb on Yorke's vocals. You'd expect more from ideas that Radiohead fleshed out as a unit, but the stolentime experiments and solo performances on this EP's tail end far outshine its exhausting first half. From Radiohead's great height, Com Lag is an addedvalue item for concert audiences and collectors, and as such, they're not cheating anyone; the EP tidily repackages Bsides spread across multiple UK singles with a ridiculous combined asking price, and adds a solid live rendition of \"2 + 2 = 5\". On the other hand, the disc is a limited Pacificrim import, and as such, is worthwhile only to Radiohead's wealthiest fans. A beautifully packaged ribbon tying up 2003's loose ends, Com Lag will most commonly endure as an infrequently accessed file folder on unscrupulous hard drives. "}
