Let's just say that Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen's sloppy vocals are a far cry from harmonious. The real standout in Rancid's half of the record is \"Sticking in My Eye,\" which they play very true to the original.\\xA0 Matt Freeman funks up the bassline in typical toomanynotesintoolittletime fashion, proving once again that he's far too good a bassist to be in Rancid.\\xA0 The track is full of catchy melodies and infectious harmonies, and is the only time on the record where Rancid doesn't come sounding like a drunken garage band. \\v\\vIt's a steady downhill decline from there.\\xA0 Specifically, \"Don't Call Me White\" is borderline unlistenable.\\xA0 Lars Frederiksen's barfbag vocals are so offkey it makes you wonder how the rest of the band lets him get away with it.\\xA0 They slowed this one down quite a bit to give it more of an \"Oi!\" feel, and yet, it just turns into a boring, sludgy mess. Sorry, fellas, the joke ain't funny when a white guy sings it.\\xA0 It is, however, funny when Fat Mike sings it he's Jewish! The same problem prevails on \"The Brews\" (as in 'Hebrews', not a 30pack of Stroh's), the other side of the \"Don't Call Me White\" coin.\\xA0 It's also about being Jewish, but this time they sped up the tempo. The original was slow, with fuzzdrenched guitars mixing well with the poppier vocals, whereas Rancid's version is a generic upbeat rocker. It's still relatively effective, but far inferior compared to the original.\\v\\vRancid's final offering comes with \"Vanilla Sex,\" a midtempo campfire protest song about censorship.\\xA0 Lyrics like, \"Don't ever take away from me my pornography\" may've sounded fresh to 2 Live Crew back in 1989, but it just doesn't cut it in these fast and furious times. Note to protestors: if you're fighting against censorship, don't use porn as your main prop.\\xA0 No senator is gonna get behind a proporn bill. NOFX's half is stronger, thanks in no small part to the fact that NOFX actually have some personality.\\xA0 They're as tight as ever here, adding an interesting flair to the Rancid songs.\\xA0 They kick it off with \"I Am the One,\" which is either about suicide, or god, or both.\\xA0 Beats me.\\xA0 It's a pretty generic punk rocker (and I don't even necessarily mean that in a bad way), with the group yelling, \"Hey! Hey! Hey!\" NOFX adds some much needed humor to plenty of these Rancid tracks, like here when guitarist El Hefe pulls off a perfect Fat Albert.\\xA0 Hilarious. Fat Mike admitted that he made no attempt to imitate Freeman's bass style, but he holds his own in \"Tenderloin.\"\\xA0 This is a typical Rancid song, combining gutter punk and rock and roll.\\xA0 It's pretty weak, really.\\xA0 But it's short, so that makes it okay. Then there's \"Olympia, WA,\" which has an intro guitar lead that's catchier than the clap.\\xA0 The breakdown towards the end practically dares you to not get fired up when it kicks back in. The whole thing closes with another classic NOFX stunt.\\xA0 They took one of Rancid's bigger hits, \"Radio,\" and transformed it from a punkrock anthem into a laidback reggae jam.\\xA0 El Hefe takes the lead vocals on this one with an odd combination of Jamaican and Hispanic accents.\\xA0 The result is really pretty funny similar to NOFX's own staple \"Kill All the White Man.\" When Screeching Weasel and Born Against teamed up back in 93 to perform songs written by each other, the results were great.\\xA0 A big part of their success with that project, however, stems from the fact that each band only did two songs.\\xA0 With the NOFX/Rancid CD clocking in at 12 tracks, it's just too much.\\xA0 I'm sure they had fun with it, and I'm sure they love listening to each others' contributions, but for us, the recordbuying public, a lot of it just seems unnecessary.
