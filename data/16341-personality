{"label":" Hotflush","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/17504/homepage_large.9e0ff1a3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andrew Ryce","artist":"Scuba","title":"Personality","text":" At some point in the past year or so, appropriating the signifiers of big, dumb, and derided dance music became the thing to do. Overdriven riffs, snare rolls, embarrassingly huge climaxes, and even lusher comedowns: Trance, prog, and electro are seeping through the pores of underground dance music. Berlinbased UK expat Paul Rose has been leading the charge with this sort of stuff, stirring controversy with his overtly trancey \"Adrenalin\" and crafting a hypnotic sugar rush with \"Loss\". Long split between the worlds of 4/4 and bass music, I proposed that last year's DJKicks mix spelled the end of the divide between his bassoriented Scuba alias and the technodriven SCB, and his third Scuba album, Personality, meshes well enough with this idea. A Mutual Antipathy had Scuba excavating dubstep structures, and Triangulation showed him sending out feelers in all sorts of directions, but Personality is essentially a techno album. It's a dayglo, plasticine sort of techno, and it's loaded with way more vocals, hooks, and tuneful melodies than the past output from a producer whose allencompassing dourness seemed to encroach on even the prettiest moments of his catalog (see Triangulation's heartbreaking \"Before\"). I've always thought that Triangulation's album cover an empty and bare concrete walkway was the best visual encapsulation possible for an artist whose music sounded completely devoid of humanity, all computer click, industrial clank, manipulated ciphers, and hollow drums. But look at Personality's cover art: There's a real piece of a human on there. Don't let the arm and the sun fool you: opener \"Ignition Key\", even with its wafting breezes of ecstatic \"ooohs,\" is every bit as cold and steely as the rest of his output. It's just reflecting more light, underpinned with the same rubbery bass sounds that defined last year's \"Adrenalin\" 12\". It's followed by the heaving Shedesque techno of \"Underbelly\", which uses Triangulation's array of manufacturing sounds: Maybe this new Scuba isn't so unfamiliar after all? Then we hit \"The Hope\". If you thought \"Adrenalin\" was divisive, well, \"The Hope\" feels like internet trolling. With a lumbering somersault of a beat that combusts into obnoxious blasts of distorted synth, \"The Hope\" is a transparent Big Beat homage, a mid1990s Chemical Brothers leftover right down to the cheesy and slightly uncomfortable vocal (\"Got the camera/ Got the zinc/ Teenage girls/ Stop to think\"). It feels defiant and irreverent coming from Scuba, but it works because it's so much fun \"big room\" in pretty much every way you can imagine. If you aren't swept up in the serotonin rushes, you're gonna be battered and bruised by its bulldozing path anyway. From then on, Personality sticks to a fairly consistent template: metallic drums, detached synths, and cheeky vocal samples, all largely sounding deliriously cheery and upbeat. The only thing more surprising than the \"never seen ya break it down like this!\" chipmunk squeak on \"Ne1butu\" is the way the track explodes into a rollicking piano riff. \"July\" deals in the \"Miami Vice\" synth pop of Hyetal, \"Tulips\" is sickly sweet garage full of feminine pressure only weighed down with Scuba's usual leaden lowend and even the fairly tepid drum'n'bass exercise \"Cognitive Dissonance\" features a dog bark as one its rhythmic devices. Almost every track features some kind of luxurious, decadent breakdown; songs dissolving into gorgeous vapor trails and glowstick reveries halfway through before coming back up for air the same device that made \"Adrenalin\" such a monster and one that doesn't show any signs of diminishing returns. That's not to say the album is all skittles and sunbursts: \"Action\" is highoctane twitch techno that coasts on snowballing momentum until it sounds like its going to explode from its own energy, and \"Gekko\" sounds a bit like he got lost in his own personal vision of Involver, all writhing basslines and indefatigably chugging chords. Scuba saves the most explosive for the closer: \"If U Want\" takes all of the album's hysteria teases and genre flirtations and bundles them into one convenient package, a fourtothefloor stormer that recalls the most maximalist extremes of 1990s techno into a sleek, powerful vehicle. Brushed by swirls of synth that hint at climax, triumphantly euphoric chords, and a bassline that sounds like a malfunctioning engine, it's unapologetically enormous, leaving anything close to subtlety in the dust trails behind it. It's a fitting end to Personality: Perhaps the most goforthejugular thing Scuba's produced, \"If U Want\" still fits into his overarching discography like the rest of the album. Even at its most novel and there are a lot of firsts here for Scuba you can still hear the same grumbly, bearded guy behind the beats. Where he once used dubstep as the foundation for his distinctive productions, this time he's taking prog house, trance, big beat, rave, old techno, and synth pop, and packaging it up in something stylishly retro, all coated in a futuristic 2012 sheen. It's bound to ruffle feathers and turn off old fans, and in a way, going so outright \"pop\" is one of the gutsiest, risky things a pillar of the scene like Scuba could have done. Thankfully, his Midas touch extends to this stuff as well. "}
