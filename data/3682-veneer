{"label":" Mute / Imperial","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/3644/homepage_large.e0ba6965.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Jose Gonzalez","title":"Veneer","text":" It's taken two years for the debut album by singer/songwriter José González (Swedish, obv.) to reach these shores, and it's easy to see what nudged it here. González's sparse recordings showcase hushed, doubletracked vocals, haunted imagery, and a clearly gifted classical guitarist. His gripping acoustic cover of countryfolk the Knife's electropop \"Heartbeats\" was even a minor hit in his homeland. An ethereal, sometimesaloof troubadour, González will sing you to sleep and then dash off under cover of night, leaving only coldsweat nightmares and an unopened bottle of sweet vermouth. Yup, two years, and on Veneer, González suggests he'd kinda like to stick around for a few more. Permanence is a pressing concern: With bongos and a hint of bossa nova, \"Remain\" emphasizes perseverance, while the scant lyrics of handclapenhanced \"Lovestain\" complain of the marks you can't just shout out of you heart, maaan. The arrangements are full of Nick Drakestyle open tunings (\"Stay in the Shade\", in particular, can't escape the shadow of that introvertfolk patron saint) and only a forlorn trumpet on closer \"Broken Arrow\" disrupting the guit/vox/maybetastefulpercussion train to Starbuckscomp paydirt. As with likeminded songstress Emiliana Torrini, González is at his best when he forces a personality onto his faceless raw materials. The distinctive fingerpicking on \"Crosses\", the best original song on the disc, rises like the spires of a Gothic cathedral, giving form to lyrics about a redemptive light in the darkness (any religious inferences, meanwhile, are left entirely to the listener). By comparison, sotto voce opener \"Slow Moves\" tries a little too hard to sound like its quietisthenewloud forebears, with a metachorus too wispy to hold tight 'til morning: \"My moves are slow/ But soon they'll know\". González's aforementioned \"Heartbeats\" cover is nearly as spinetingling as the original, if not its frenetic Rex the Dog remix. Echoing M. Ward's \"Let's Dance\", Iron & Wine's \"Such Great Heights\", and Frente!'s \"Bizarre Love Triangle\", González strips the electropop down to an acoustic lullaby, laying bare a powerful melody and deceptively evocative lyrics about love, regret and nostalgia. González has also covered Kylie Minogue's \"Hand on Your Heart\", and the gulf that remains between these musthears and his selfcomposed material is significant. González knows a great song when he hears it, and he plays a mean guitar, but in 2003 he was still more raw than the overseas buzz suggested; Veneer is nice, but it may just scratch the surface. "}
