I think not!\" \"But Master Holmes, the note!\" Watson clutched the document apparently left on the mantelpiece by the newly deceased Lord BarringtonEssex III, whose body lay on the parlor floor of his winter estate. He read the words again:I cannot bear it anymore. Blink 182 and their countless ilk have reduced the esteemed form of punk rock, ultimately, into a cheap novelty act, devoid of purpose or soul. Alien Ant Farm's \"Smooth Criminal\" cover was the nail in my coffin. The only option, for me, was suicide. Goodbye, uncool world. Lord BarringtonEssex III Holmes dismissed the note with a wave of his oversized hand. \"Watson, you will observe that the signature on that note does not precisely match the one on this crude painting Lord BarringtonEssex created before he was fiendishly murdered! Also, it is clear that the victim was not disenchanted with the state of punk music he was, in fact, just discovering it. Note what was in his stereo unit, which, I deduce from the lack of dust, was played extremely recently. It's Thee Headcoats' debut album, Headcoats Down! \"But Holmes,\" Watson blurted, \"that record is from 1989. He could have been waxing nostalgic for what once was...\" \"Not so, my dear Watson. The original release of this album on Thee Headcoats songwriter Billy Childish's own label, Hangman Records, was vinylonly. This is a CD reissue from Damaged Goods. A fresh purchase. No doubt Lord BarringtonEssex was just getting excited about music again. Listen!\" Holmes pressed play. The first song, \"Smile Now,\" blasted out at high volume. It contained all the simple trademarks of Thee Headcoats: bluesinfused punk with buzzing guitar; Billy Childish's compressed vocals laughingly bleating out simple lyrics of loveloss and retribution. Somehow it made the \"Louie, Louie\" chord progression sound fresh. \"Please Little Baby\" followed, with a fast surf beat propelling a rolling organ. Watson perused the liner notes but couldn't find a keyboardist listed. He did note that the three gentlemen mugging on the cover had equipped very familiar headgear. \"Watson, notice how he says 'Oh pleeeaase.' How a rocker says 'please' is of paramount importance. Rock is the music of begging, a prayer that turns women from mere mortals into gods. I deduce that Billy Childish is the real thing by the way he intones the word.\" \"You're correct as usual, detective,\" Watson agreed. \"Even when he's putting us on, it's not with some snotty joke, but with a warm winsome manner.\" Indeed, this music, in all its simplicity, ran from quite sober to downright silly. \"Child's Death Letter\" detailed Mr. Childish's last wishes and funereal philosophy. \"When I die, I don't want no mark on my grave,\" he howled on the almostfolk number, as an unsteady slide guitar ascended like a departing soul. On \"John the Revelator,\" a song performed a cappella, save for a handclap, Childish was so ensconced in his message that he practically gargled with passion. Then, on \"I'll Make You Mine,\" he laughed a great laugh as he sang, \"I'll put my brand on you.\" And, in perhaps the best song Watson had ever heard on the subject, Thee Headcoats waxed eloquent on \"Wily Coyote\":I got a stack of dynamite and a hundredton weight I got TNT birdseed to use as my bait I got a blunderbuss contraption and a Sherman tank I got cannonball fuel injected rollerskates So little Road Runner, let me put you straight This blues stomper left the impression that the Road Runner would soon be caught. It was a message of hope for Watson. \"No, Watson, no one listening to this record could kill himself. It's too full of laughter, and the simple bluesy lines with punk's raw vitality are an unbeatable formula that a prolific master like Billy Childish would repeatedly use to generate hundreds of whimsical, wonderful songs. And I've just deduced that, despite the recent breakup of Thee Headcoats, they're coming out with another album later this year. Billy Childish has even assembled a new band called the Buff Medways. \"So Lord BarringtonEssex III would have something to live for.\" \"Yes. Note also how he's been sawed in half and preserved in an aquarium of formaldehyde. A strange method of suicide.\" \"It's like the work of that installation artist Damien Hirst with his Stuckist Art movement. Do you think Hirst could be the culprit?\" \"No, dear Watson, I'm afraid this is the work of my archrival, Professor Moriarty.\" \"Really! It seems he's been responsible for the last seven murders we've investigated.\" \"Yes, he's been on quite a roll.\" Holmes pocketed his magnifying glass and donned his overcoat. Watson grabbed his bag and made ready to leave. Then he paused. \"Holmes?\" \"Yes, Watson?\" \"Do you think you'll ever get sick of punk rock?\" Holmes sighed. \"I swear I'll quit it someday, old man, but I say the same thing about my sevenpercent solution, and just look at these tracks.\" The End "}
