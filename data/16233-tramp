That album's tracks, and those of the home recordings she also released that year, were sparse, Van Etten's voice sometimes barely above a murmur, as if she were trying to figure out how to make music at the lowest functional volume. Her next record, 2010's Epic, was almost more of an EP just seven songs but it was a leap forward in sound and spirit. Epic pulled in little bits of kickdrum and pedal steel and electric guitar, and ended with \"Love More\", on which she proclaimed, over a doubled harmonium and wavering synth, \"You chained me like a dog in our room/ …It made me love, it made me love, it made me love more.\" Van Etten first recorded \"Love More\" for WXPN and Weathervane Music's Shaking Through web series, which captured the session on video. It was one of her first inearnest collaborations with other musicians, and can almost see new synapses firing behind her eyes: this is what music can be, this is what I can be. It's fitting that the same song grabbed the attention of the National's Aaron Dessner, who wound up producing Tramp, her first album for Jagjaguwar. The new tracks come from a year and a half of sessions wedged in whenever Dessner and Van Etten were both off tour. It includes appearances by Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, Julianna Barwick, Dessner's brother/bandmate Bryce, and other friends of the sort that apparently tend to \"just drop by\" when you're a celebrated musician/producer with a studio in your Brooklyn garage. That Van Etten has been given the time and space and resources to feel out her path, unhurried by the tyrannous buzz cycle, is both a total luxury, and totally vital. It's the default assumption that a female songwriter, performing under her own name, is \"confessional,\" that she's serving up some dark part of her soul for the world's consumption. And maybe one day Van Etten will slip into the voices of strangers just as easily as she inhabits her own. But for now, confession is still very much the thing. \"It's selftherapy,\" Van Etten has said to nearly every interviewer who has asked, and more and more that seems to refer to both the writing and the production of her songs; that she can draw out the words, bring them into a room with other human beings, and together with them lay something beautiful on tape is both transformative and redemptive. Matters of mistrust, isolation, and uncomfortable togetherness dominate Tramp, rolling through every track like a sick, creeping fog. Maybe Van Etten is still nursing the psychic wounds carved into her by that one Tennessee boyfriend, or maybe it's something else; either way, she sounds, at last, good and angry and ready to put up a fight. First comes the dark jangle of \"Warsaw\", then the calculated frankness of \"Give Out\" (\"You're the reason why I'll move to the city/ Or why I'll need to leave”). On \"Serpents\", the album's lead single, she scoffs, \"I had a thought you would take me seriously.\" As guitars strain at their tethers and Walkmen drummer Matt Barrick pounds out marching orders, the plea she issued three years ago on \"Much More Than That\" \"please don’t take me lightly\" quavers, crumples, turns to ash. After the torching comes the slow, steady burn. \"Kevin's\" sounds like an Epic latecomer welcomed into Tramp's fold, Van Etten’s voice, falling somewhere between Cass Elliot's range and Cat Power's emotional register, turns darker and resigned, the whole song one long smoky exhale. \"Leonard\" is a dreamy, abashed waltz; tickled by ukuleles and kicked along by a big bass drum; it reveals the album's lone confession that seems to stem from anything close to guilt. It's an admission that takes three gorounds of the chorus to make itself fully known, Van Etten shuffling around the hard truth: \"I am bad\" \"I am bad at loving\" \"I am bad at loving you.\" The album's brightest spot comes with the steady, strummy \"We Are Fine\", in which Van Etten talks through a panic attack with a friend (\"Take my hand and help me not to shake/ Say I'm all right, I'm all right\"). Beirut's Zach Condon sings harmonies and a verse of his own, the song written with him in mind, Van Etten says, not just because she first plucked it out on a ukulele, but because they both do battle with the gnarly beast of social anxiety. There's often no clear balm for Van Etten's laments, but \"We Are Fine\" is both the means and the end, the sickness and the cure in one. Tramp is maybe best thought of in terms of having a Side A and a Side B; otherwise, the middle section falls into a weird midalbum slough that doesn't quite jibe with Van Etten and Dessner's generally excellent sense of timing and space. Imagine a click, a pause and a careful flip between the fractured, meandering \"In Line\" and \"All I Can\", which starts with a mewling organ hum and gradually wills itself into blistering hugeness. That song might have worked, too, as a big closer; the seething \"Joke or a Lie\" serves better as a feint than a final attack. As it is, the album doesn't end so much as infinitely loop on itself (serpents, indeed), the last track's final scrape threading back into \"Warsaw\"'s opening thump and clank. \"I want my scars to help and heal,\" Van Etten sings on \"All I Can\". That healing comes, in part, from the making of the music that act of physically locating the pain in some way that can be accessed and then shelved as life tumbles on. But it comes, too, from being pushed out into the world, to people who now say, \"Yes, we are here, and we are listening.\" "}
