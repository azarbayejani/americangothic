The neighborhooded nonheroics were typical: Major Stars should play the band next door, even if their publicist sort of apologized in an email to me for them sounding like a \"generic bar band.\" He likes the record, too; I think he figured I'd need glamour to get with it, though I didn't. But I can empathize: One time (in these pages, matter of fact), I also tried to sell Major Stars on a bigger ticket \"rock reclamation\" or something like that and had to wait six months (and see 'em in two different bars) before realizing they were a bar band, and thank God for it. Like lots of bar bands, Major Stars know an awful lot of music (Wayne Rogers and Kate Village run one of the most insanely specialized music shops in the country), and they also enjoy a good fiery solo (try \"Syntoptikon\"). Their band has just enough members to be awkward on any stage (three guitarists, a bassist, designated vocalist, flailing drummer), and when they play, they seem to outdrink half of the audience. They also have barband stagemoves down: Rogers thrusts his hips when he lights up his guitar; Village does a good guitarasdick; and Sandra Barrett kinda runwaywalks across the stage when she sings. Unlike a lot of bar bands, Major Stars are also a fullon psych group, albeit not dull or abstruse. They have groove, thanks to Dave Dougan's bass and Casey Keenan's ability to keep time across fiveminute stringimprovs, and almost every vocal part is melodic beyond the standard psych wail/drug mumble. After the release of last summer's \"Black Road\" b/w \"Pocket\" single my favorite of 2005 I wrote that Major Stars' songs \"worship the guitar without worshipping the inflated package it sometimes hides,\" a critique that turned out to be more about my hangups than theirs. Those two songs are included here and they are nothing but monolithic packageswinging (though half the time, at least, the package is femaleappended): Syntoptikon dreams big. Who cares about access to a band playing rock music (even I've been in a band!)? It's no fun unless they still want to change somebody by doing it, or get laid by doing it two things that are surely the same.  \"Collapsing\" makes indelible a mere 1:25 of Barrett, with two slashing chords and setforththearmy snares; she's all octaves and nostalgia, then stands back as Rogers & co. chorus in circles around her wayback dream. \"Fake Date\" comes on more noncommittal (as did \"Pocket\" and \"Black Road\", and as \"Cinnamon and Lightning\" is here, though it's catchy as fuck), but then the rhythm drops out and the nonchalance is just a front: There's even an avenging riff to make you forget the lapse. This is also, presumably, why they've got \"The Ravager\" and \"Syntoptikon\" around, to bury the bleeding soft parts. It doesn't work Syntoptikon will be a record that leaves a mark, it's too raw to do otherwise but that's rock for you: The guitar always has something behind it, and sometimes above it, too. "}
