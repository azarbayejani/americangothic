I had that pleasant misfortune when I spent my junior prom night hanging outside a neighbor's Pontiac that blared Ministry's \"Everyday Is Halloween\". The song seemed about right for good times at home when your friends, acquaintances, and enemies are living fairy tales.Ministry fused the American teenage wasteland with industrial music taking the noise out of the galleries, basements, and bridge underpasses and onto the sunmelted, thirdgeneration tapes on so many metalheads' dashboards. Yet, their 1984 gothdisco hit, \"Everyday\" is decadence of a difference sort. The music plods along like a 45 of Bananarama's \"Venus\" spun by a worn turntable belt, while our man Al Jourgensen yowls, \"Well I live with snakes and lizards/ And other things that go bump in the night/ Cos to me everyday is Halloween,\" in a faux Aussie accent like an undead Peter Garrett. Good times, good times.Last year saw a Ministry renaissance. After hangups with Bugs Bunny Records, comastermind Paul Barker's departure, and skag abuse, the Chicagoans finally regained their dues or at least revived 1992. Their 2004 album, Houses of the Mol√© returned to the glorious horrorshow of Psalm 69, namely the robotized street carnival riot of \"NWO\" (built on Bush Sr.'s declaration of a \"New World Order\"). During the same year that saw Bush Jr. stay in power, up came reissues of Jourgensen's trailertrash funk unit, Revolting Cocks, plus a director's cut of Ministry's landmark entry into Industrial with a capital \"I,\" Twitched. However, the most interesting releases to emerge are Early Trax and Side Trax episodes of Ministry's virginity and the venereal diseases it then spread to others.Early is like reading a second grade book report. Actually, the synthpop that defined Ministry during the early 80s is decent. Hearing electroclash for the past few years somehow immunized me from both the Miami Sound Machine attack on the hexagon drums and Tronage synths. Early is essentially Twelve Inch Singles repackaged with a few extra remixes and bsides. The main additions are the fey, Costelloid impression in \"Overkill\" and the passable Sisters of Mercy raveup of \"I'm Falling\". However, the distant factory din can be heard on the previously unreleased oldie, \"He's Angry\", as the percussions echo like clockwork loosely akin to the fascistfunk of their later \"Land of Rape and Honey\".Side offers some of the best ideas that Ministry never used during their late80s heyday, a time when thrashmetal made sense as mechanized blues for the Information Age. Chief among them went to Pailhead, Jorgensen's 1988 oneoff with Ian MacKaye, and the curious 1000 Homo DJs, who released a Black Sabbath tribute EP where an uncredited Trent Reznor and Jello Biafra figured in.Urban legends of Ian \"I've gotta Straight Edge\" MacKaye dropping LSD during the Pailhead sessions aside, the songs from their Trait EP offer a deft marriage of postpunk guitar harmonics and conveyorbelt rhythms. \"Don't Stand in Line\" could be industrial's own \"Eye of the Tiger\" (sans the camp), while \"I Will Refuse\" pits MacKaye against the din of a TV his lone voice of defiance fading in and out of the ether.1000 Homo DJs' lone 1991 EP is best remembered for its gutbucketmetal cover of the Sabs' \"Supernaut\" where Mr. Reznor screams in his sleep. It's the happiest I've heard the boy, although Biafra does make a great actor in playing a good ole boy cop harassing a car full of metalheads in \"Hey Asshole\". However, Jorgensen gives a convincing barfly's afterschool lecture in the leafblower groove of \"Better Ways\".The rest of Side sounds like scifi soundtracks for the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones and the Van Dammes; where commentaries on the human condition and destiny are articulated by M60 gunfire. PTP (Ministry with longtime collaborator Chris Connelly) delivers ESPN grooves that the Everquest and Quake burnouts might enjoy. Their standout is \"Show Me Your Spine\" from the Robocop soundtrack, which features the priceless orchestrastab and Skinny Puppy Nivek Ogre's forkedtongue. Much stronger is Acid Horse (the crew versus industrial pioneers Cabaret Voltaire) and the Chicagoan electrofunk of their lone single, \"No Name, No Slogan\".Some purists argue that Ministry ruined industrial music, converting the genre's multimedia terrorism and rawness into mere metal fodder. Perhaps we could have been saved from the mid90s dreck of bands that major label sold to Hot Topic shoppers if Ministry still aped to be the next Thompson Twins. Nonetheless, Side Trax has a few fresh ideas still worth returning to. "}
