Nothing would thrill me more than to tell you these sons of Montreal play calypso or spin Goa trance, but the dismal truth has, in essence, already been spoken. Of course they're a fucking garage band. Sheesh.Star Witness, out on Oh! Tonito a newish Michigan label that appears to be a Le Grand Magistery offshoot is that saddest of things: a perfunctory run through a waning fad. Which, in a review, usually calls for an equally lazy round of unflattering similes, commencing...now! The Snitches are like the Hives without the evil wit, Mooney Suzuki without the electric sweat, the Raveonettes without the elegance, the Strokes without the entitlement. In fact, the only compliment I can pay this band, and the reason I find myself straining to say anything nice at all, is that their mediocrity never seems calculated. It's not a ploy or a gambit the Snitches make genuinely, honestly shitty music. The album's opener, \"December 21\", is a rote fourchorder with a remarkably honest opening statement: \"I tried to get it right/ But I'm a lazy boy.\" Things pick up somewhat by the third track, \"Right Before My Eyes\", wherein the lead Snitch works up a glammy sneer a la Bowie bywayof Spacehog bywayof the Interpreters. All hope is then promptly dashed with the arrival of towering twin embarrassments: \"Willie\", a slick bore that sounds like all the other Canadians rockers pogoing across MTV2, and the dread \"Perfect Gentleman\". This one starts with lonesomeseagull sounds (a class A felony in itself), segues into a pseudoLatin centerpiece, then throws it away, suffering a brief attack of fuzzy chorus before bringing the fucking seagulls back. The band fares a tad better on \"Sugar Mommy\", a straightup appeal for female sponsorship with a nice vintage whiff to it. In fact, it might generally behoove the Snitches to go fullon retro: the bluesy \"Gets Me Down\" and \"Swallow\" are the best tracks on Star Witness, and not coincidentally the least faddish. The blues might also break the Snitches of their abstract poetry habit, which at one point sent me to the liner notes to make sure these guys are not Quebecois. Lines like \"This must be cool/ I can pretend that we are one and that we laugh,\" and \"Slut Shark oozes wax across the dance floor\" scan like lobotomized Robert Pollard prose translated to French and back. The Snitches' final damnation is their overreaching metaconcept of ratting people out. Their name figures in at least two songs, and a murky promotion on the band's web site invites you to \"finger a Snitch.\" Thanks but no thanks, I'm keeping my nose well clean of this baby powder. "}
