Further singles and chart appearances culminated in 2007's Think Before You Speak, a charmingly heartfelt album somewhere between a less insular Arctic Monkeys and a less caffeinated Futureheads romantic insecurities you could dance to in your trainers. When sharply accented singer/guitarist Rhys Jones sang, \"Things were better when we were young,\" the future still sounded bright.Now No Hope, No Future. The world has changed a whole lot since the mid2000s, musically and geopolitically, and Good Shoes are probably being at least halfserious about their sophomore album's title. The London fourpiece are confronting the same boring bummer as so many others in this \"new 'normal'\" economy. Success isn't as successful it used to be, you start growing old before you stop growing up, papa don't preach. What results is an album that sounds like the 00s even as its themes are solidly turnof2010. A darker album, a slightly clumsier album, but an album with a strong unifying themes and a few songs worth stepping away from the bar for.\"Time may change me,\" sang Bowie, \"but I can't trace time.\" Guess who was taking notes. Good Shoes are obsessed with permanence and flux, what's innate in a person and what might eventually turn sour: relationships, careers. No Hope, No Future's first single, \"That's the Way My Heart Beats\", bouncily blames the narrator's ongoing girl problems on something in his nature. By contrast, evocative finale \"City by the Sea\" as close as UK indie gets to power ballads is right there with Death Cab for Cutie's \"Meet Me on the Equinox\": \"All I want's a little more time/ To feel your heart beat next to mine.\" Everything everything ends.After a debut record wrapped up in girls and going to shows, Good Shoes deserve credit for continuing to sing about what they know even as that gets darker. \"Times Change\", an assault on cranky oldsters, has guitars neatly uptight enough for Field Music, and it's refreshingly difficult to figure out where to put the air quotes on tense relationshipender \"Then She Walks Away\": \"I know I should be the one to say those words/ Like, 'Times change, but I want you to stay.'\" But gloomy quarterlife crisis songs leave less room for error, and even on the latter track, Jones sings contrivedsounding words about how his words sound \"contrived.\"When No Hope, No Future isn't staring glumly into the void, Good Shoes could be a whole other band the band of their debut, only more seasoned. There's the Chicchic discofunk of \"Under Control\", which would resemble Art Brut if Eddie Argos sang about sex addiction rather than impotence. There's also the sprinting release of \"Thousand Miles an Hour\", which functions almost like a surfrock instrumental. On \"I Know\", Jones attacks zealots of all stripes with a preachy certitude that would make Billy Bragg sound like Ghostface Killah if not for the halfwinking title. It's been said the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. Yeah, but it's also been said, \"Know thyself.\" "}
