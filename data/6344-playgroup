{"label":" Astralwerks","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/6252/homepage_large.ce7cbd96.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Paul Cooper","artist":"Playgroup","title":"Playgroup","text":" If Pitchfork handed out awards for how lush an album sounds, how crispily hifi a release is, then Playgroup's selftitled debut would easily scoop up such an accolade. However, the majority of Pitchfork's readership isn't concerned with albums that give their vacuumtube stereo systems a thorough workout. The majority of you care if an album has something to say if it speaks to you in some way. Playgroup, regrettably, talks loud and fast, but says nothing substantial. The face behind the Playgroup facade is Trevor Jackson. Not a household name, but you've likely encountered his production skills if you've investigated leftfieldleaning hiphop and dub funk. Assuming the alias Underdog, Jackson remixed several Massive Attack singles (\"Sly,\" \"Protection,\" and \"Risingson\") as well as Death in Vegas' \"Aisha,\" Cornershop's \"Sleep on the Left Side,\" and Sabres of Paradise's \"The Theme,\" to name a few of his many treatments. When not tweaking paying clients' work, Jackson runs the Output label. It was Output that gave Fridge their break when they released Sevens and Twelves, Ceefax, and Semaphore, as well as Kieren Hebden's first Four Tet album, Dialogue. In addition to making cuttingedge UK postrock available, Output released fullon aggro disco/notdisco cuts by Sonovac, Gramme, and 7 Hurtz. Jackson compiled the roughest, most thrilling cuts these bands had created on the essential Channel 1 collection. Jackson's Skull project fomented some brokensound illbience and vies with Kevin Martin's Techno Animal project to formulate some of the illest industrial dub ever produced. Jackson faultlessly summarizes the disco/notdisco sound with \"Make It Happen\" a barebones masterpiece of mimicry that repairs the damage caused by Dave \"Sessomatto\" Lee's clusterfuck reworking of ESG's \"Moody.\" With \"Make It Happen,\" Jackson appears to understand the sublimated aggression that Martin Hannant coaxed from the three South Bronx ladies who comprised ESG in a way that Lee completely ignored for his own financial gain. I first heard \"Make It Happen\" on the London Xpress rarities compilation Nuphonic released last year. Since then, I've longed to hear the Playgroup fulllength and to hear how Jackson would recast a golden era of dance music for a 21st century audience.Playgroup, however, is all about cashing in on the current vogue for the 80s. Rather than joining the synthpop crowd (Felix da Housecat, Ladytron, Fischerspooner, et al.), Playgroup looks to downtown punkdisco and the loft agitdance of early 80s Manhattan and seeks to awaken the departed spirits of Larry Levan, Liquid Liquid, and JeanMichel Basquiat. Opener \"Number One\" perfectly pastiches Larry Levan's lysergic remixes. Jackson gets Levan down so precisely that he even incorporates a variant of the analog synth squiggle that is the signature of Levan's reworking of \"Seventh Heaven\" by Gwen Guthrie. Instead of building on the success of \"Make It Happen\" and expanding beyond theoryintopraxis slogans, Playgroup is a childish game of 'let's pretend to be revolutionaries.' But most often, Playgroup doesn't even engage on that level. For instance, in his commitment to stripmine every 80s dance style, Jackson even resurrects 'hiphouse' that excruciating amalgam of house music and rap. I'm grateful that Jackson doesn't try to convince me that hiphouse was anything but utter crap \"Front 2 Back\" features the lamest rhymes since Technotronic and Ya Kid K: \"Hip house and jazz, percussion and bass/ It's razzmatazz/ Just feel the flavor/ And jump right in/ 'Cuz it's a lifesaver/ No special behavior/ Is ever required/ Do it until you're tired.\" As if that's not torture enough, Jackson recasts Paul Simon's \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\" as the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\" complete with \"Bring da hook! Yo! Sing it again, dog!\" interjections from his peeps in the studio. Elsewhere, Le Tigre's Kathleen Hanna goes through the riotgrrl motions on the Slitssampling \"Bring It On\" without ever really believing that her hectoring will roust anyone from their Ethan Allen sofas. Edward Collins does a passable turn during \"Medicine Man,\" but only succeeds in making me go digging for my Orange Juice CD's and wishing I wasn't broke so that I could afford the recent Josef K reissues. For a couple of minutes Jackson covers the dialectic funk of Scritti Politti's \"Sex\" well, actually just the incendiary bass line; Jackson forgoes the indebttoDerrida lyrics. Beyond displaying his own flashy production skills, Jackson's only goal here (as throughout this album) is to grab someone else's groove, while ignoring their often provocative message. Since Jackson has been promoting this gaudy album by appearing at swank SoHo parties at Emporio Armani and at Jane magazine's inviteonly do's, he does nothing to escape my very low opinion of this deceitful album. By coopting and debasing punkdisco's vitality and sincerity and thereby rendering the style accessible to the botoxandbulimia set, Jackson betrays the visions of those whose ecstatically powerful music he lavishly degrades. Playgroup is far from being people power in the disco hour. "}
