{"label":" Fader","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/18515/homepage_large.5478b290.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Steven Hyden","artist":"Matt & Kim","title":"Lightning","text":" The hysterically peppy Brooklyn duo Matt & Kim started with a dubiously clever idea: Take the sound of maximalist Top 40 pop, and apply a lowbudget, DIY aesthetic to it. Four albums later, Matt & Kim still have exactly one idea, and it's barely expounded upon on Lightning. Matt Johnson still sticks to the cheesiest synth sounds and sings in a cloying whine that is the height of indie twerpiness. Kim Schifino is tasked with supplying the group's \"punk\" energy, but her drumming remains shackled within the confines of Matt & Kim's stultifying song structures.  Lightning is a regressive record even by Matt & Kim's standards, marking a retreat from the slickedup advances of 2010's Sidewalks. With the able assistance of producer Ben Allen, Matt & Kim appeared to be making an honest effort to compete in the pop marketplace on Sidewalks, engaging with hiphop while buffing up the melodies to a radioready gloss and generally desmirking the dance grooves. Probably not coincidentally, Sidewalks ended up being Matt & Kim's highest charting record to date. While it's not quite accurate to suggest that Matt & Kim were pushing forward musically, the group did seem to be on the verge of becoming a real pop band without the quote marks. Lightning on the other hand is a backtobasics album, which in Matt & Kim's case is very basic indeed. \"Now\" is typical of the simplicity of Matt & Kim’s songwriting, with its monotonous keyboard squiggle, stiff rhythm, and repetitive chorus. Like \"Now\", \"It's Alright\" repeats its title refrain what feels like 142 times in the space of three minutes. Ditto that for the interminable \"I Said\", a fourminute pop song that feels much longer. By comparison, \"Let's Go\" is relatively musically diverse, changing tempos and moving from the requisite lame synth sounds to spare piano chords. But it's still twice as long as it needs to be; as is Matt & Kim's custom, it takes a marginally charming concept and forcibly beats out every last remnant of freshness, and then beats it some more. Perhaps the caralarm blaring of \"Overexposed\" and the limp hiphop homage \"I Wonder\" translate better in a live setting, where Matt & Kim have long been celebrated as energetic purveyors of bodymoving meathead jams. But on record, these songs sound like parodies of unsophisticated \"fun\" pop music made by people who don't have a clue what makes unsophisticated pop truly enjoyable. In the context of Matt & Kim's discography, Lightning is inconsequential. Like an echo of an echo, there's nothing here that Matt & Kim haven't already done over and over again. "}
