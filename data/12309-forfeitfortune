{"label":" Constant Artists","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/12606/homepage_large.9dccd26d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amy Granzin","artist":"Crooked Fingers","title":"Forfeit/Fortune","text":" Selfreleasing may be a viable revenue model for already massive sellers like Radiohead and Trent Reznor, but the jury's still out on whether forgoing record label patronage can keep smaller artists in subsistence rations, let alone support a rock'n'roll lifestyle. Last we heard from Eric Bachmann in 2006, when he released the lyrically grim (even by his miseryloving standards) solo record To the Races the guy was living out of his van. By choice, according to the musician, but still. So despite culling a decent following over the course of four solid Crooked Fingers fulllengths and a superlative covers EP and shoredup by a road warrior work ethic Bachmann's decision to hawk this one himself is somewhat risky.He's made Fortfeit/Fortune available in four formats via his website and also through iTunes and two dozen handpicked independent brick & mortars. So fans who only spend their dollars at the Walton family company store and other momandpopcrushing big boxes are out of luck. (Buy independent, y'all!) There are no hard feelings between Bachmann and recent Crooked Fingers label Merge (a relief, because if you can't count on Merge to do right by artists, hardened skeptics and rabid new paradigm types are right, and labels really are obsolete). Though even a savvy indie with a battalion of crack publicists might not know how to sell this oversalted stew. Typically corralled into the Americana pen, Crooked Fingers has for some time owed more to Iberian (and more recently, Eastern European) folk, contemporary AngloAmerican singer/songwriter conventions, and punk rock, than Appalachian ballads, Nashville, or Neil Young. And on previous album, 2005's Dignity and Shame, the loosely cobbled band's strange brew went down reasonably well.Now, imagine that concoction several shots stronger and a whiff past its consumeby date. Bombastic, Bossbaiting opener \"What Never Comes\" has Bachmann emitting a teethgrinding burr while the track's airless mix is smothered with sax solos. Not a promising start to an album but hey, if it's ever filmed, St. Elmo's Fire II has its theme! Next, \"Luisa's Bones\" imposes flamenco fancy dress on an otherwise charming drummachined pop song winsomely sung by Elin Palmer, and Spanish motifs reassert themselves on \"Phony Revolutions\", \"No Me Lo Des!\", and the unfortunate \"Sinisteria\", which I can only guess is about Lou Reed chatting up Tom Waits in an Andalusian karaoke bar. Devotchka's Tom Hagerman lends his gypsy strings to \"Let's Not Pretend (To Be New Men)\"'s funereal drone and \"Modern Dislocation\" pays tepid tribute to commercial alternative radio. Just running down the tracklist is exhausting.    Bachmann's a good songwriter and musician with some exceptional credits \"New Drink for the Old Drunk\", \"Devil's Train\", \"Angelina\", and \"Andalucia\", to name a few postArchers highlights. And downer that it is, To the Races is a beautiful record: thoughtful, patient, spacious, and sparingly embellished. So among Forfeit/Fortune's many misses, Bachmann can't help but hit a few. Neko Case guests on the synthswamped new wave duet \"Your Control\", her cognac alto leavening Bachmann’s saltandvinegar baritone. And \"Cannibals\", the kind of weary, latenight, lastcall rocker that could get your drunk, lazy ass moving, is also decent (even if it recycles bits of Dignity and Shame's \"Call to Love\").Here's where record reviewers usually say something about transition albums, and from a practical, economic standpoint, Forfeit/Fortune is certainly that. But considering Bachmann's always been a restless soul and every Crooked Fingers release is arguably a travelogue dispatched from the road to a radically different followup, transition talk would only be making lame excuses for a disappointing record.
