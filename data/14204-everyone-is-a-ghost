Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell formed the nowonhiatus Mojave 3, and Halstead himself has made a few quiet acoustic albums on his own. Guitarist Christian Savill, when working with friend and former Eternal bandmate Sean Hewson in Monster Movie (a project that predates his involvement in Slowdive), hews more closely to Slowdive's later aesthetic.Up to this point, however, the duo's albums have been spotty at best, with momentumdraining tempos and a weakness for maudlin melodies. The timid pallor obscured prime slices of buzzy altrock like \"1950da\", from 2004's To the Moon, or \"Winter Is Coming\", from 2002's Last Night Something Happened. Both were tacked onto the end of their respective albums, as if not to disrupt the otherwise downcast mood.On Monster Movie's first album in four years, Everyone Is a Ghost, the obligatory altrock cut, \"Bored Beyond Oblivion\", is right in the center of the 10track collection. The programming changeup comes with a shift in focus. The songs here feel brighter and more energized, at times recalling jagged pop of Brian Eno's early songoriented records. The sharply melodic guitar lines of opener \"The World Collapsed\" and \"Fall\", for example, recall Robert Fripp's contributions to Here Come the Warm Jets. The bulk of the record is split between moderately fuzzy shoegaze and blearyeyed folkpop, and the former fares slightly better, especially during the anthemic burn of \"Silver Knife\" and \"Fall\" and \"Bored Beyond Oblivion\"'s sugary distortion. Even midtempo songs like \"How the Dead Live\" and \"In the Morning\" carry a certain shine.There are a few clunkers here the wornout, blaring beats of the title track and the overproduced \"Help Me Make It Right\", specifically but Everyone Is a Ghost is, ironically, more full of life than Monster Movie's previous output. It suggests a revitalization within the duo's songwriting, if not simply a necessary change in outlook. It's as if after two decades together, Savill and Hewson are finally enjoying themselves. "}
