It could've just as easily been a decade or a couple of days. That 2006 album's boozily psychedelic dancerock showed an affinity for such previous Manchester groups as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, with blockrockin' beats that might've belonged to the Chemical Brothers, plus Teutonic grooves that aligned the band with the motorikminded likes of Caribou, Fujiya & Miyagi, and 120 Days. And it wasn't \"nu rave.\" Even as electronic acts keep appropriating rock tropes, and guitar bands go on revisiting the postpunk disco, WfaNFC's debut still sounds distinctive. There's an anthemic grandeur unknown to your average Justice or !!!wannabes. Also setting WfaNFC apart is their pastoral side, which on this year's Rocket EP brings to mind the woolly, interstellar indiewithbeats of the Beta Band. WfaNFC's debut and half of their EP come together with a mixed bag of previously unreleased tracks on double album Businessmen & Ghosts, their first American release. What made Working for a Nuclear Free City and the Rocket EP so enticing makes Businessmen & Ghosts a worthwhile acquisition, too. The band's best bassdriven dancefloor bangers and stately, textured landscapes are all here, and there are a couple of fresh surprises, too. At nearly one hour and 45 minutes, WfaNFC's latest release is their closest to comprehensive. This isn't an ideal introduction it's a bit overwhelming all at once, and the track order has been unnecessarily, incoherently reshuffled but at least it's not import price.  Though a few extra bucks wouldn't have been too much to pay to have checked out WfaNFC in time for your last New Year's party. When these dudes lean on their rhythm section, their feet don't stray far from their effects pedals. \"Troubled Son\" and \"Dead Fingers Talking\" are as focused on Gary McLure's rumbling guitar distortion and Phil Kay's scifi electronic pulses as they are on Ed Hulme's hiplocked bass and softly deadpanned vocals or Jon Kay's drumming (McLure and Kay cofounded the group). New tracks like \"Donkey\" and \"Eighty Eight\" follow suit, while \"All American Taste\" adds echoey strums to another grooveheavy burst of bleating shoegazer guitar noise.  When they're not strobelighting the dancefloor, WfaNFC weave woozy atmospheres for an intoxicated ride home bathed in subway fluorescent or headlight halogen. \"Rocket\", from the eponymous EP, counts down (and builds up) to an unheard ignition with campfire strums, lilting leadguitar plucks, refracting keyboards, chugging bass, and Airy synths. From the debut fulllength, \"Over\" templates this approach with bleary harmonicas and a cosmic groove. Tracks like \"The Tree\" or \"Quiet Place\" carve a nostalgic ache out of cracked indiepop jangle, while \"The Tape\" sets handclaps and spokenword vocals atop glistening guitar arpeggios. New song \"Asleep at the Wheel\" is WfaNFC at their most surging, with the Edgelike guitar repetitions holding up a sustained plateau. (If you downloaded the album, this track is probably mislabeled.)  WfaNFC had displayed plenty of range prior to Businessmen & Ghosts, though they still haven't broken much new ground. Their most startling turn here is the previously unreleased \"Sarah Dreams of Summer\", which opts for maracas, handclaps, and peppy guitars in a song that's halfway between Britpop and Sarah Records, as melodic as it is deceptively melancholic. \"When I look at her/ it feels like I've never been born,\" comes a Revolver allusion wrapped in Beach Boys harmonies.  Sure, a few of the latest tunes \"Apron Strings\", say, or fleetfingered \"Nancy Adam Susan (Shatter)\" tend to drift. As a whole, though, Businessmen & Ghosts is a longoverdue U.S. document of a band that might just be getting really interesting. And no, they don't much care either way about nukes.  "}
