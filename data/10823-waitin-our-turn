Really? Just coffee? Coming from Devin the Dude and his massive band of friends, colleagues, and former Odd Squad comrades? Coded language 101. A fun, lowbudget companion piece to Devin's last solo piece, this year's Waitin' to Inhale, the Coughee Brothaz (say it like java) posse albums sticks to unhurried, sniffling postGfunk roaches, and, without even knowing it, tosses together a skillet of pleasant, congealed, unambitious toasting. Sometimes the beats nose out in front of the lyrics, (\"On The Road\", \"Cockhounds\"), sometimes the lyrics (smoking, drinking, smiling, slipping the dick in that order) get up off the couch a step ahead of the catatonic basslines and halfasleep claps. It's not a knock against it to say nothing grand is at stake here. The credits in the liner notes don't have individual names next to the tracks. The bulk of the songs were already available on an obscure prelease mixtape available at your nearest shadyass torrent site. While a Scarface cameo on albumopening \"Rise & Shine\" is nice, accessible touch, and secondincommand Jugg Mugg is a loose, uncluttered MC, the voices, on the whole, break down to either Devin or some other dude. The other dudes are fine some angry, some queasy, some fluttering spit fires, some bass chompers. When everyone is trying to save the game, it is great to hear people just going through the day with themselves \"You might find me at the crib makin' some pizza!\"  Shunning almost every vestige of contemporary hiphop identity, the huddled (in a circle around the lighter) masses of the Coughee Brothaz are satisfied delighted, even to turn out a few lines about crawling to the parking lot, keeping their fingernails untrimmed to break up weed better, and trying to get a piece of the pie. It goes without saying, but THC ain't the only thing Waitin' Our Turn is drenched with most (and by most I mean a healthy 75%) of the MC's have got a sweaty sleaze, totally aped from Devin, somewhere between woodtrim minivan owner and airport bar lothario.  Devin himself is a fantastic narrative MC a little Raymond Carver, a little Boomhauer, a little Slick Rick and almost worth the price of admission alone. He doesn't contribute anything on Our Turn as riotous as the \"Boom\" skits on Exhale or as detailed and warm as, say, the dazzling \"Lacville '79\" from 2002's Just Tryin' Ta Live, but he composes his durable tales and spits out common man comeons (\"I usually don't dance/ But I'll make an exception\") and narrative asides (\"Somehow we touched on the subject of weed/ Somehow she also smoked, I said 'Follow me'\") as well as anyone postBiggie. Devin raps on seven of the album's fifteen tracks, and when he doesn't divvy up a verse he's unspooling a chorus and hook, using that gassy, enunciated croon to push the album cuts along.  While lowkey drum machines are the backbone of Our Turn, there's plenty of appropriately rural effects and instrumental touches. \"The More I Spoke\" sounds like a threeminute bridge of paperthin 808s. If you could play Scruggsstyle acoustic guitar, it'd sound like \"On The Hunt For A Lady\". \"Don't Get Me Wrong\" has dashes of those decaying Pfunk whistles Dr. Dre loved to abuse, and \"Fresh Rims & Vogues\", the album's deftest gem, dishes up swaying, purple rhythms and soft, quittingtime sonar moans.  The album doesn't shy away from sideways humor either. \"YeeHaw\" gets the Southern pride twisted into tongueincheek, and \"Rise & Shine\" plays with the chronic/caffeine metaphor over a piano sample so cheap and twisted it should score budget children's carnivals, a crowing rooster, and fauxBritish accents.  In a fall that feels like one endless slowroasted August, there are far worse ways to spend the wee hours of the hazy afternoon or murmuring, windowsopen afterparty AMs than grabbing a beatup spot on the couch and letting Waitin' Our Turn pass between friends in a room. Just keep it in your cipher. "}
