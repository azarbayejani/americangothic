Cyann & Ben the Locusthijacked spacefolk space folks from Paris used to wear buttondown shirts, smoke Dunhills, and keep their mobiles in leather cases; now their drummer is trouncing around in a onesie shouting about how far he can stand from the urinal and still \"make it.\" Now come on, that's just impossible. Hans & Frans they're not, but Cyann & Ben did have a noble air to them on their 2003 debut Spring. On that album, the band took small steps but the kingly weight of those moves shook the earth. Cyann & Ben left most notes unheard and the rest hushed and whispered, extending folk minimalism well beyond the clouds. \"Siren Song\" is the closest we earthlings get to martian transmissions. Space is still the place on Happy Like an Autumn Tree, but Cyann & Ben are less subtle and perhaps even a little boisterous about their prerogative this time. The band plays as if it has an idea what it sounds like (or what it's \"supposed\" to sound like, whatever that means), and sometimes it feels as if Cyann & Ben get caught up in making songs \"spacey\" instead of letting their flying saucers attack at will. The massive whirling synth/piano/drum figures that blast open \"Circle\" could very well appear in the orchestra score for a theater version of \"Galaxy Quest\" I'm not convinced that's a good thing. But Cyann & Ben have higher expectations of themselves, and soon settle into a stately etude for piano, guitar, and voice that leaves implicit the song's early bombast. It's a terrible case of BLOTS Bad LeadOff Track Syndrome because on the rest of Autumn Tree the band steers clear of such stonethrown hubris. \"Silence and Little Melodies For...\" is OK Computer's \"Fitter, Happier\" without the Macintalking; \"Gone to Waste\" and \"Close to Discovery\" brood like sumptuous dark side epics the latter madly bowed and Charalambidean. This is good theater. As it progresses, Autumn Tree becomes increasingly ambitious, and we're rewarded with \"A Moment Nowhere\" by far Cyann & Ben's most masterful song to date. The beat's a little too pronounced but that hardly matters once the band begins unraveling Cyann's wrenched melody (\"How many words will I rhyme?/ Does it get me closer to you?\") into louder and louder electric guitar solos, racks and racks of distortion, and a frightening Orff chorus at the end. The beautiful \"Summer\" falls cleanly between Spring's Sparta and Autumn Tree's Neronian Rome, filling the space with unexpected harmonies and synth flourishes when appropriate. \"Summer\" would have been a great place for Cyann & Ben to end their album, as the song touches upon their past and present sounds with plenty of good omen to boot. Instead, the commonplace and somewhat affected \"Obsessing and Screaming Voice in a Shell\" calls Cyann & Ben to the curtain with offbroadway slide guitars and trite RPG melodies. Which is not to say Autumn Tree runs short on good moments; what was great about Spring is often just as great here and in two instances way better. Aspiration comes with perspiration, though, and this gorgeous French quartet will smell a lot better after a shower. "}
