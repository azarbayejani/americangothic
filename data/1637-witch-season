Altcountry may be floundering especially since one of the movement's founding fathers, Jeff Tweedy, has delved into a noisier, decidedly urban jamrock derivative but this gifted San Francisco quintet have persisted, and it's paid off. The group's 2001 sophomore release, Bless You, was a weighty collection of lonesome Big Country swooners, by turns introspective and evocative of largerthanlife landscapes. A breezier and more refined The Court & Spark returned this summer with Dead Diamond River, a laconic fivesong EP that hinted at experimentation but still brought the twang in bales. If that record sowed any suspicion that The Court & Spark were drifting away from their altcountry roots and into more exploratory territory, those notions are quickly dispelled by \"Suffolk Down Upon the Night\", the opening cut on the band's new LP, Witch Season. In one fell swoop, The Court & Spark reconcile their latent experimental tendencies and penchant for downy textures with their everwinsome countrypop roots. The track's pedal steel inflections are a nice textural element. The track also highlights, better than anything the band have done, the skill and finesse of their arrangements, owing more aesthetically to orchestral pop than strippeddown country. \"Out on the Water\" is a slowburning, lateafternoon jam overflowing with organ drones and gilt trumpet accompaniment. It would be difficult to believe it's The Court & Spark playing were it not for M.C. Taylor's reliably tender vocals, at once blithe and melancholic. Taylor is a remarkably casual vocalist, effortlessly delivering his supple melodies rather than oversinging or trying to add gravity through feigned affliction or other contrivances. His band is a perfect accompaniment: musicians who answer subtlety with even more subtlety. These songs don't deviate from The Court & Spark's previous approach as much as show an increased stylistic breadth. \"Denver Annie\" and \"Hallelujah I\" with their meaty arrangements and strong melodies emphasize the \"pop\" in countrypop. The requisite tearjerkers are here, too: \"Steeplechasing\" opens with a huge, plodding bass drum beat before evolving into a somber piano ballad that actually grooves. \"Swimmingly Endless\" is similarly downcast, though hardly despondent. Even on their gloomiest numbers, The Court & Spark crack the door wide enough for the refulgent light of their charming melodies to pour inside. Unfortunately, many of the tracks dissolve into one another, blending into a mix of nondescript acoustic guitar melodies. At times, Witch Season is so sandeddown it could soundtrack a new season of \"This Old House\"; absent is the type of emotional impact they left on the expressive Bless You centerpiece \"National Lights\". But fans of that album won't be disappointed after the lengthy wait for Witch Season, which picks up where The Court & Spark left off three years ago making emotive, imagistic music. "}
