Formerly singer for the mid1990s Michigan band Marzuki (which also included Sufjan Stevens), Stephens struck out on her own at the end of that decade, only to become disillusioned by the machinations of record distribution and promotion. She subsequently went on a lengthy hiatus, and it wasn't until last year that she finally put out her second fulllength, The Breadwinner. It was exactly the kind of record a person makes when she's taken several years to concentrate on things like starting a family and finding stability, things that aren't usually in the offing for people who make their way as touring musicians. The Breadwinner was resolutely an album about hearth and home and the economic and emotional toil of family life, but it was also about the simple sustaining pleasures these things provide.In that light, this reissue of Stephens' debut lends it the feel of a prequel, and that's where bravery enters into the equation. Given what a different place Shannon Stephens is in today compared to when she made her solo bow, and especially considering the deeply personal nature of her work, it would have been understandable if she'd felt these decadeold confessionals were best left on the shelf. Fortunately, Stephens has the wisdom to grasp the value of songs written in relative immaturity, because her debut is a truetolife snapshot of a sensitive young person navigating the travails of falling in and out of love.Emphasis in that last sentence on \"out.\" There are a couple of moments here where Stephens seems achingly close to bliss, making pancakes for a lover on \"I Want to Be Your Friend\" or recognizing love's powers of redemption on \"Deliverance\". But even on the initially benign opener \"So Gentle Your Arms\", with its imagery of cream sodas and heads on shoulders, there's the suggestion of unhealthy temptation, leading Stephens to admit, \"I am a fruitless tree.\" It mostly gets more dysfunctional from there, and if Stephens' heartache sometimes gets dulled by overused metaphors (trains, arrows), she makes up for it with frequent bouts of refreshing frankness, admitting she's \"weirded out\" (\"Panic\") and \"talking aloud in the city park\" (\"Months\"), outing a troubled boyfriend who \"told Helen Keller jokes\" (\"Catch the Morning Line\") and then outing herself for a Morrisseyapproved compulsion to drive into a tree while her lover's asleep in the passenger seat (\"The Way Relationships End Up\").Musically the album is mostly very spare while occasionally displaying a countryish bent, particularly on the pedal steelaugmented \"Panic\" as well as on \"I Want to Be Your Friend\" and \"Catch the Morning Line\". There's also a tantalizing gospeltinged red herring in the form of \"I'll Be Glad\", which was covered by Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy on his 2008 album, Lie Down in the Light. Jauntier efforts like the banjo and accordionblessed \"Air So Thick\" stick out probably more than they ought to, which means there's entirely too much sonically inert coffeehouse fare here. So maybe Shannon Stephens' debut is something less than revelatory, but pairing it with The Breadwinner still creates an interesting set of bookends to the past decade and provides an intriguing glimpse at the emotional maturation of one earnest, perceptive woman.
