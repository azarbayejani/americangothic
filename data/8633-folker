Back in the fabled early days of The Replacements, his abundant songwriting skills always shone brightest whenever his audience was most justified in expecting a fullfledged drunken implosion. However, things went south for Paul once listeners began to recognize his genius and demand that he fulfill it by delivering unto us a tour de force, or at the very least a big record with hit singles. Record companies got into the act and threw him huge recording budgets and trips to the studio with the likes of Don Was, and our man buckled and began to poop out lifeless mediocrities like Don't Tell a Soul or Eventually. So in a way it was only too predictable what would happen after the commercial and artistic nadir of 1999's Suicaine Gratifaction chased off the remnants of his audience. With nobody listening and all pressure lifted, he went down to his basement and reclaimed his mojo on 2002's unvarnished double Stereo/Mono release and hasn't looked back since. Perhaps in part to further minimize the demands put on each individual album, Westerberg is now following one of Bob Pollard's most cherished songwriting axioms: If you can't always dazzle them with brilliance, stupefy them with productivity. (The idea being that it's a lot easier to forgive the occasional \"Silver Naked Ladies\" if you haven't waited three years to hear it.) Folker is Paul's fifth album of new material in the last two years, which is more output than he managed in the preceding 10.  Adhering closely to the formula established on Stereo, the album again finds Westerberg all alone down in the rec room, muffing lyrics, gloriously airmailing guitar solos, playing the drums like he's doing the dishes, and generally having a fine time. In fact, there are moments when Folker reaches Vampire on Titus depths of fidelity, which probably qualifies it as his sloppiest recording yet, Grandpaboy or no. By now, though, we've all learned that if a Westerberg tune can't cut it in this environment, there's no amount of studio polish that'd have been able to fix it anyway.  Things get off to an inauspicious start, with the banal onenote joke \"Jingle\" (\"Buy it now, buy it now/ This is my single/ This is my jingle\") lasting at least twice as long as necessary despite its oneminute runtime. Thankfully, Westerberg recovers to settle into a nice hitting streak, bashing through effortlessly catchy songs like \"Looking Up in Heaven\" and the very GBVish \"As Far as I Know\" with an ease seldom heard since \"Waitress in the Sky\".  There's a disarming simplicity and artlessness to these and other highlights like \"23 Years Ago\" and \"Gun Shy\", with an increased emphasis on persistent pop melody over crafty wordplay. This is fortunate since Folker is not Paul's strongest effort lyrically, with the quotable gems (\"Bring a thimble and I'll pour my thoughts out\") just barely outnumbering the groaners (\"I promise not to bug you/ Only just to hug you.\")  That's not to say the album is entirely without thematic heft. On the contrary, the album's emotional centerpiece is \"My Dad\", a tribute to Westerberg's recently deceased father that stands among the most nakedly heartfelt he's ever written. In hands less deft, a number like this could've become unbearably maudlin, but Westerberg's wry humor and painterly eye for detail (\"He's never seen me play/ But he gets a kick from the newspaper/ When he sees the family name\") make it a stirring and poignant elegy, and when it closes with him repeating, \"My dad I love,\" it should bring a lump to the throat of even the most jaded ironyhound.  Not even Westerberg's classic albums have been free of filler (unless you can honestly say you still get a kick out of \"Gary's Got a Boner\") and Folker has its fair allotment of pointless misfires like \"$100 Bride\", with its unfortunate chorus of, \"I promise not to leave the room/ Even if I've gotta vomit.\" It's tracks like this one that'll drive you insane if you're deluded enough to think that Paul still has that flawless masterpiece in him somewhere. But if you've resigned yourself to the fact that we're always going to have to accept his periodic pearls of brilliance with a healthy side portion of flies in the sherbet, Folker should meet and possibly even exceed your expectations.
