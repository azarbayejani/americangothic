Because the Stooges heard on Raw Power were not the same band that produced 1969's selftitled debut or 1970's Funhouse, but rather some mutant, zombie version. With the Stooges dropped from Elektra, Iggy exploited a soloartist deal with David Bowie's management to reassemble his band around new guitarist James Williamson, pushing Ron Asheton to bass and rebranding the Stooges as \"Iggy & the Stooges\". And in accordance with those changes, Bowie's infamously trebleheavy Raw Power mix thrust Iggy's vocals and Williamson's searing solos miles out in front of the rhythm section, to the point of practically writing Ron and drummer/brother Scott Asheton out of the set.All of which has made Raw Power the most contentious release in the Stooges catalog, a fact that Iggy himself effectively owned up to in 1997 when he issued an exponentially louder and beefier new mix that took the album's title to literal extremes (and, in the process, horrified audiophiles with a distaste for digital distortion). It speaks volumes about the songs' pure immediacy and charisma that, even in its original mix, Raw Power became the album most responsible for giving the Stooges a life after death. Where the primordial caveman blues of The Stooges and the protometallic grind of Funhouse made them touchstones for future grunge, stonerrock, and noise artists, Raw Power provided a mainline for firstgeneration punks and the 80s hardrockers that followed in their wake. (Case in point: When J Mascis and Mike Watt hooked up with Ron Asheton for some 2001 dates, they only performed songs from the first two Stooges albums; when Guns N' Roses and the Red Hot Chili Peppers covered the Stooges, they did songs from Raw Power.)There's no denying that the Raw Power era was the band's most prolific: the album's eight songs account for just a fraction of the music Iggy & the Stooges produced between their 1972 reformation and their unceremonious 1974 dissolution. Over the past three decades, the number of bootlegs that have attempted to collect all the unreleased material from this period from the Rough Power comp of deBowiefied mixes to the notorious lastgig document Metallic K.O. have amounted to a minicottage industry that's been as vital to sustaining the band's legend as their four official releases.So, for an album that runs a mere 33 minutes, Raw Power should provide ample fodder for deluxereissue treatment and an opportunity to streamline all that bootlegged ephemera into an official storehouse of all the songs the Stooges produced between 197274. However, this reissue available in a 2xCD, budgetpriced Legacy Edtion set and as a more elaborate $60 4xCD Deluxe Edition doesn't attempt anything quite so ambitious. Instead, the main impetus is bringing a remastered version of the original Bowie mix back to market. This is understandable from an historicalpreservation perspective, but then why not also include the '97 mix and allow fans to compare and contrast?The new remaster certainly enhances the ambient details in the mix like the tense acoustic underpinning of \"Gimme Danger\", or the echoing beat in \"I Need Somebody\" that illustrates Bowie's intention of making Scott Asheton's drums sound like a lumberjack chopping wood. But, personally, after spending the past 13 years having my ears ravaged by the '97 Iggy mix, I find it difficult readjusting to the leaner, original version even with the remastering, the '97 version far outstrips it in fidelity and sheer brute force, and remains a better entry point for younger listeners seeking to understand the album's impact.Still, even if you've already bought this album twice, the Legacy Edition's second disc offers a compelling reason to shell out again: an immensely entertaining, wellpreserved 1973 Atlanta club set that was intended for a radio broadcast but later aborted. Recorded months after Raw Power had been released, ignored, and consigned to cutout bins, the set sees the Stooges in another transitory state, further asserting Raw Power's 50srock roots with the addition of jaunty pianist Scott Thurston, but also patiently stretching out new songs like \"Head On\" and \"Heavy Liquid\" into loose, exploratory, Whostyle workouts. It also unintentionally redresses Raw Power's initial imbalance by smothering Williamson's leads in the Ashetons' thick lowend. Naturally, the combination of Iggy and a crowd of southerners results in some colorful exchanges (\"You wanna get your little fucking face punched out, little cracker boy?\"), and it's fun to revisit a moment when the Stooges' audience was sparse enough to make out individual conversations (says one spectator: \"I don't think he likes us!\"). But more than a document of Iggy in his audiencebaiting element, the set serves as a great tribute to the late Ron Asheton, whose bassplaying is finally revealed to be every bit as fierce and inventive as his guitarplaying.The live disc is appended with two Raw Power outtakes a more compact, studio version of \"Head On\" and the silly rumbleinthejungle jam \"Doojiman\" but anyone hoping for more vaultclearing revelations on the expanded 4xCD Deluxe Edition (available exclusively through www.iggyandthestoogesmusic.com) will be disappointed. The \"Rarities, Outtakes and Alternates\" disc seems especially illconceived, padding out its few genuine finds (an amusing, embryonic version of \"Penetration\" dubbed \"I'm Hungry\", and the VelvetsviaHendrix goof \"Hey Peter\") with a random assemblage of alternate mixes (including a pair of 1997 representatives) and an incomplete sampling of the era's wellknown outtakes (\"I Got a Right\" and \"I'm Sick of You\" are accounted for, so where the hell's \"Gimme Some Skin\"?).Easy Action's 2005 bootleg boxset, Heavy Liquid, did a far more thorough job of compiling the Raw Powerera castaways, so Stooges completists investing in this Deluxe Edition will need to be satiated by the nonmusical extras: a replica Japanese \"Search and Destroy\" b/w \"Raw Power\" seveninch, 48page book (filled with celebrity testimonials and Mick Rock's iconic period photography), five 5x7\" photographic prints, and, most valuably, a DVD documentary about the album's creation by Morgan Neville. Comprising recent interviews with the surviving Stooges and famous fans like Johnny Marr, Chrissie Hynde, and Henry Rollins, the doc covers all the main album talking points and offers a memorable moment of candor when Iggy admits to feeling vindicated that the Stooges still have such vitality and relevance today. There was certainly no lack of irony and cheek when Iggy first sung \"we're going down in history\" on Raw Power's kamikaze closer \"Death Trip\", but watching the closing shots of Iggy & the Stooges performing for a Brazilian festival crowd last year, with Mike Watt inheriting Ron Asheton's mantle, those words now sound more assuredly prophetic than ever.
