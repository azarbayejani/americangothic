In the tradition of many posthardcore bands, there are winding time signatures, grinding guitars, and strained, often obtuse lyrics \"Prince Squid\" starts with a theatrical bellow over fast and heavy drum rolls, \"He wants to be the big shot in your eyes/ But he's in FLUX MEMORANDUM.\" You know, your typical boymeetsgirl confusion. But there's no reason to get down on TAAS for the trappings of their subgenre (or for not picking a name that makes a catchier acronym). While they're continuing in a tradition, it's clear from Tail Swallower & Dove that their ears have remained open.Swallower may feel familiar at first, but it's a record with many left turns. Some of them are more subtle than others. Opener \"Woolen Heirs\" starts out surging and swinging, with acrobatic guitar lines and punishing rhythms, but has a cooldown that includes fauxtribal chanting and some keyboard effects that'd be more at home on a Steve Miller record. And then there's repetition and patience in the closing minutes of nearepic \"Ethric Double\", marrying sparse, ominous jangle and a nearmartial backbeat to a more traditional metal sound by the end. The second half of the record has the band stumbling and sputtering around foreboding electronic landscapes, growing more coldly mechanical with the end of \"Long and Lonely Step\" before the jagged lurch of \"Lead Beater\" and pitchshifted vocals of \"Cavity Carousel\". The rhythm section bludgeons and swings with authority throughout all of it, with a surprising (and welcome) amount of the latter.While the keyboards and chanting in \"Woolen Heirs\" might illicit a giggle and the 8bit electric piano groove on \"Lucifer\" is a little close to latecareer Blood Brothers for comfort, for all the band's stylistic wavering and kitchensink compositions, they usually seem to land squarely on their feet. There's a lot of balance on Swallower the songs are diverse without losing their taut and tortured center, and they even balance progrock indulgences with songs that prize catharsis and big riffs above all. But in that diversity, they never fully inhabit one mode or the other. These guys are capable of a lot more than you might first assume, and yet, it'd be interesting to hear what they could pull off if they focused in just one direction. "}
