In those days, the wispy Glaswegian septet numbered merely six, and local boywitharabstrapmadegood Stuart Murdoch produced an early single (\"Eighties Fan\") and arranged strings for them but wasn't yet shooting their album covers. Upon its release, U.S. listeners could only find this fine indie pop outing while exchanging shy glances in particularly wellstocked imports aisle. Thankfully, Merge has finally dusted off the group's UK breakthrough for American release, and although the record is narrower in scope than its followup which hopscotches from Leonard Cohen to The Supremes it still sparkles. On their charmingly understated first date, Camera Obscura hew more closely to their contemporaries than their 1960s influences. Winsome, acousticdriven songs such as \"Swimming Pool\" and \"The Sun on His Back\" fit comfortably alongside fellow bedsit pop acts like The Guild League, The Fairways, and of course, Belle & Sebastian. Tracyanne Campbell's stifflipped vocals even evoke those of The Softies' Rose Melberg, particularly on \"Let's Go Bowling\" (one of the reissue's two bonus tracks, along with \"Shine Like a New Pin\"). Here, Camera Obscura play their teenromance cards close to their hope chests; the line between earnestness and artfulness is indeed thin. Like B&S;'s best (there I go again!), the sprightly \"I Don't Do Crowds\" could be an anthem for Victorian Lit majors or an ironic pleasure for disaffected hipsters just finding \"I'm a Cuckoo\" via its Avalanches remix. But more likely, it's both. Campbell, who shares vocal duties with John Henderson, adds to those delicious double layers on opener \"Happy New Year\", offering this oneofakind couplet: \"Did you know I could be a lot of fun?/ I'm aware that friendship can die young.\" Elsewhere, \"Double Feature\" waxes precious about Catherine Deneuve and winter, and \"Houseboat\" takes an outsider's look at the fun lovin' found in Christine McViepenned Fleetwood Mac. A dispute over Nancy Sinatra provides the chorus to \"AntiWestern\" (\"I'm taking your boots off,\" Campbell retorts), and \"Pen and Notebook\" works in a winning Johnny Marr namedrop over halting piano, which is later joined by swirling orchestration that runs the risk of boring any chamberpop Philistines still in the audience (their loss). \"Eighties Fan\" the single that brought Camera Obscura to the notice of John Peel has a drum opening that could have played over the Lost in Translation credits. Because of its connection to Murdoch, it's the bestknown of these early tracks but there are a halfdozen songs on Biggest Bluest HiFi that are just as good. Very few of them, however, capture the band's songwriting strengths placing a modern lyrical twist on the 1960s arrangements of Bacharach, Webb, and Hazlewood as well as \"Eighties Fan\" does. Come to think of it, very few tracks on Underachievers do either. "}
