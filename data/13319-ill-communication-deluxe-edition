Where Check Your Head was a jam session turned venting process turned crossover success, Ill Communication is the album that let them infuse their turn towards sincerity with a renewed sense of playfulness, solidifying their transition from the gleefully exaggerated badboy anarchists of their first two albums to a trio of (slightly) more mature, trendsetting enthusiasts. It's as if they took stock in their history, realized they were past the point of having to prove anything, said what the hell, and decided to throw their whole repertoire into the album. Considering the record was assembled over a comparatively brief sixmonth span, it's an ideal, condensed snapshot of the Boys' genuine interests and cultural obsessions, whether they were spiritual (Buddhism), musical (late60s/early70s souljazz) or recreational (no less than three members of the 199394 Knicks get shoutouts). It's the Beasties at their most lifestylesavvy, though they came across less like opportunistic youth marketers and more like the idiosyncratic hipsters they'd always been. (Remember, this was in 1994, before \"hipster\" was a pejorative.)Their lyrical personalities are a bit more distinct, too, even as they keep up their traditional micpassing backandforth rapport: MCA's the pistolsmashing, antimisogynist, spiritual one, who gets a couple of solo joints to mull over the decaying state of the world (\"The Update\") and espouse upon his Buddhism (\"Bodhisattva Vow\"). Mike D's the instigator of analog throwbacks (\"I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD\"), workingclass style (\"I'm shopping at Sears 'cause I don't buy at the Gap\") and bboy golf chic (\"Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot/ Then you throw me off the green 'cause I'm strictly hiphop\"). And AdRock's the irreverent namedropper who compares himself to everyone from underground cartoonist Vaughn Bode to Moog pioneer Dick Hyman in the process of bigupping his microphone technique. But even amidst all the GenX coolhunting and socialconscience soulsearching the Beasties were undertaking at the time, Ill Communication rings true because it stands as one of their most dedicated engagements with hiphop culture. They're game as far as actual lyricism goes; even if they're a halfstep behind the dizzying, rapidfire linguistic freeforall of Paul's Boutique, there's enough quotables and inspired moments of limber beatriding in tracks like \"Sure Shot\", \"Root Down\", and \"Do It\" to hold up.It helps the cause that the Caldatoabetted beats have a close affinity with the classic postPremier/Pete Rock early90s NYC production sound, to the extent that it sounds a bit like the work of a Native Tongues auxiliary and not just because of QTip's great, offthecuffsounding guest spot on \"Get It Together\". It's an influence the Beasties wear on their sleeves, focusing \"Root Down\" around the reverentlyacknowledged 1972 Jimmy Smith jazzfunk classic of the same name, infusing cuts like \"Alright Hear This\" and \"Flute Loop\" with Village Vanguard atmosphere, and throwing around a cratedigger's shopping list of names Les McCann, Yusef Lateef, Archie Shepp, Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie in \"Alright Hear This\". Throw those moments alongside anything off Buhloone Mindstate or Midnight Marauders and they stand up strong, plus you've got yourself a hell of a pool party mixtape.A whole album full of that caliber of straightup hiphop would've been a pretty safe bet for borderlineclassic status, but the fact that Ill Communication frequently switches between that and their more sprawling liveband stuff actually adds to its kitchensink charm a bit largely because so much of it's cut from a similar cloth as the souljazz records they sampled for their lyrical cuts. Sure, the big axeswinging titan at the center of this album is the fuckyeah highlight \"Sabotage\", the meatiest slab of moshpit raprock aggression the Beasties ever put to tape, and it stomps around a bit conspicuously between the funkbop grooves of \"Root Down\" and \"Get It Together\". It's a classic case of the album's biggest single being its leastrepresentative track, though I ain't complaining about its inclusion in the least; I think the one time I listened to that song and didn't get all amped, I was in a bronchitisfighting NyQuil stupor.But the instrumentals that they'd started experimenting with on Check Your Head are a bit more at home here, and they benefit from some additional polish and a tighter structure. The growly, earlyFunkadelicmeetsEl Chicano doomfunk jam \"Futterman's Rule\", the violindriven shtetldub of \"Eugene's Lament\" and Money Mark's sleek electric piano vibeout showcases \"Ricky's Theme\" and \"Transitions\" reveal a band that's busted their asses in the process of honing a relatively new aspect of their craft. They also wisely relegate their hardcore tendencies to the realm of absurd intermissioncaliber comedy tracks; they might not be the most indispensable songs, but there's something inherently hilarious about using Minor Threat aesthetics to rail against a \"Bill Laimbeer motherfucker\" pickupgame nemesis.Like Check Your Head, this reissue of Ill Communication comes with a bonus disc of Bsides and remixes; unlike Check Your Head, the Bsides and remixes are mostly goodtogreat, though a bit redundant if you already own 1995's Root Down EP and/or are uninterested in listening to 87 seconds of the Beasties playing basketball. Still, it's worth it to hear the Prunes' Free Zone Mix of \"Root Down\" and the live performance of \"The Maestro\" where AdRock goes fantastically apeshit on the \"yeah, you motherfuckers, I'm all that\" bit. In any case, the best thing about this reissue is that it's a good excuse to reassess an album that isn't quite as derivative and tossedoff as you might remember.Since it shared some of their previous album's stylistic tendencies, a few listeners were left trying to pinpoint where the groove ended and the rut began when the album first came out. It's still regarded in some circles as a watertreading attempt to continue drawing off the aggropunk/garagefunk blueprint of Check Your Head, and lord knows I'll probably draw some whatthefucks for opining that Ill Communication's actually a fair bit better. But once the Beasties got a steady grip on their liveband sound, the fact that they found a way to reincorporate the gleefully adolescent goofiness of Licensed to Ill and the retrofunk style and popculture obsessions of Paul's Boutique is what really let them put together their ideal heretostay mission statement.
