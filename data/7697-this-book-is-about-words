I had read the backstory from the liner notes: an Atlanta bike messenger with an acute sensitivity to air takes a roadtrip one fall, brings along some guitars and a borrowed laptop. \\x93You have roots and wings,\\x94 he says, \\x93but now is the time for roots.\\x94 Just another guy using Scott Herrex92s name to issue a private experiment on Eastern Developments, I thought. Twenty long minutes of abstract snoozeout. Accessible, but inscrutable. Unreviewable. From the dry perch of reviewery, the nonverbal cuts a slim profile. Sometimes it just vanishes. This is no great loss for literature, but music is a different story: often the more wordy (like most rap) or wordish (like Prefuse 73) an album is, the easier it is to describe and evoke in words. Music writers regularly dodge this problem by talking about people, or scenes, instead of the music itself, but that's not a solution. Oddly, This Book is About Words is the least verbal music I've heard in a long time. Only after a monthlong train trip through India, a weeklong silence at my computer, and a daylong blackout did I start to wander away from the thought of talking about this music. I saw something there, and I want to tell you about it.  Each track unfolds in a meandering line, like a bike messenger who's forgotten his destination but not the urgency of the message; or, as the liner notes suggest, an \\x93unmanned vehicle.\\x94 The feel of acoustic guitar sets up a lot of the figures, kind of like Villa Lobos meets Nick Drake as seen through a variety of prisms and filters. The textures that result are alternately fuzzy and airy, open and clean undemanding, and sincere. Music that's almost richer when you forget to listen. \\x93Para Eva\\x94 abandons a driving ticktrack early on for some aimless noodling, but the harmonic logic starts to drop back in, slowly, as the track becomes its own autopilot, pushing into a simple vamp that hides a little system of twangs and skips. The basis of a real beat fashioned from sampled taps and cracks even drops for a few seconds in \\x93Tobacco Path\\x94 before the guitar licks pan out in a ticcish fit of selfinterruption.  \\x93Goodbye Beautifuls\\x94 stuttersprays its opening sallies, then voids itself in diphthongs and cracklings, but \\x93Cadaques\\x94 proves a real song, with the kind of aimless inertia that few but Evan Mast have mastered. The only track whose unplugged version might stand on its own is \\x9385 Into Night\\x94; muffled plucks and greasy squeaks confirm that this music is digital after all: music for fingers. Perusing its own flat domain, barrelling down a road leading to more road, This Book is About Words is scattering in a fit of skips and purrs. And panning out. "}
