His status, his profile, and his output all coincided with a lateaughts surge in this new universal club music concept, fusing the commonalities of Southern bounce, classic house, nuelectro, oldschool presampling hiphop, and West Coast gfunk into an allencompassing new urban dance music. And his patronage of that scene defined it flatteringly if you want to remember the late 00s fondly for some reason yet to be understood, ATrak's first Dirty South Dance and his mix Infinity +1 should be enough to make you believe the end of the decade was actually great.So why does Fool's Gold, Vol. 1, a stateofthelabel comp showcasing the imprint he started with likeminded DJ Nick Catchdubs, feel like a debilitating hangover? As solid as the label's been in its threeplus years of releases, too much of this collection of recent material feels weirdly retrograde and a bit crass, a mushy assemblage of the obvious that feels a lot more backwardlooking than the best the label has to offer. It might be too early to go ahead and say that electrorap is on its way out, but if it is, the synthpop affectations of Trackademicks' \"The Best Stroke\" and Kid Sister's warmedover jerk slog \"Don't Stop Movin'\" are hollow epitaphs. There's also a Lil B track, \"Freeze\", that exhibits zero of whatever makes Lil B exciting; I've never heard casual gimmehead misogyny sound so bored. And if you thought CyHi da Prynce's verse on \"So Appalled\" was a work of sabotage, check out ATrak's \"Ray Ban Vision\", an otherwisechoice piece of engagingly woozy bounce that the rapper ruins by yammering about how he fucks women with his sunglasses on.Things sharpen up a bit when you get closer to standard house turf though you have to wade through a few throwbacks to get there. Some are cringeworthy: the synthdrums from Tears for Fears' \"Mad World\", a Stepford version of Teena Marie, and a vocoder? Try harder, Treasure Fingers featuring Haley Small. And some are crowdpleasing: Tensnake's always good for some earnestly joyous beardo disco, and even though his remix of Vega's \"No Reasons\" feels like preservationist house à la 1995, that piano riff is a hell of a reason to consider that a good year to visit. A few tracks are a bit more forwardlooking Flosstradamus' \"Cape Town Get Down\" and Riton's remix of Congorock's \"Babylon\" incorporate shreds of contemporary South African house and electro into their structures but you'll probably be more satisfied if you come in expecting slightly postmodern tweaks on familiar vintage sounds from Detroit (Jokers of the Scene's \"Power Slave\") or Chicago (LA Riots' \"Control Your Tuba\").Fool's Gold has put out some quality stuff lately just this year, we got stylehybridizing advancements like Kingdom's blistering garage/electro crossover \"Mind Reader\", the superior original mix of Congorock's \"Babylon\" firing a 21laser salute at UK funky, and the manic, equatorial house of Greenmoney's Gold Ru$h EP. That's more than enough to give you a sense of what this label's really capable of, and it feels like a more tenable direction than the nostalgic, somewhat ossified vision of dance music laid out in Vol. 1. File this under When Bad Comps Happen to Good Labels, and keep your fingers crossed. "}
