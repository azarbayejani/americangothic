Here's the scoop: Bing Ji Ling is a guy's name. Bing Ji Ling also translates to \"ice cream\" in Mandarin. Bing Ji, the man, wants you to believe ice cream is an aphrodisiac. Bing Ji, the band, appears in concert with the dudes from No Doubt drummer Adrian Young and guitarist Tom Dumont dressed in 1950s Good Humor Man outfits. Bing Ji Ling also employs former pro skater Tommy Guerrero on bass, but on his debut album, Doodle Loot Doodle a Doo, he plays just about every instrument by himself; crisp, Cool Whip production is provided by the very interrogative Merkley???. Bing Ji Ling is actually S.F. white boy/soul man/sundae fanatic Quinn Luke, and Bing is funkier than Fudgie the Whale with a blunt in his blowhole. If Sly was a oneman family or if Beck and Prince took a double dip, it would taste something like this. All good humor aside, Luke and Merkley??? clearly understand that the fundamentals of funk come down to hooks, texture and innuendo, and there are good 'n\" plenty of all three here. The album starts off with the filtered wahwah guitar and Casiotone percussion of \"Do What I Gotta Do\". A partystarting screamer, the song climaxes with a looped oneman choir delivering quivering background vocals alongside swaggering horn splashes that erupt in an orgiastic PFunky eargasm. The song sets the bar damn high in terms of production quality and giddy, goony charm, and though there's diversity throughout the rest of the album's 46 minutes, the cookie never crumbles. \"Put Your Hand in Mine' is a midtempo organ grind as Luke wails like his Rhodes, \"I've been through some sticky clover/ But now my picking is over.\" The robotic handclaps on \"Can't Say Much\" crack over the layered, pitchshifted vocals, while \"So Natural\" brings Steely Dan together with Prince in a cokeheads 'n' cream wet dream. Weighing in at the halfway mark is the anthemic \"Money in the Meter\". Up to this point, lyrically speaking, there's a common theme of goforbroke, wetsheets sexual abandon, and \"Meter\" follows suit. No Doubt's Young makes his only album appearance here, keeping a real time beat snapping under a rubbery guitar lick and the chantworthy chorus. It's easy to imagine this song killing it live, as it offers not only the repeated lyrics (\"Put your money in the meter/ Stay for a while\") but a scathingly sexy, shimmering melodic swing. After these six minutes of unfettered flirtatiousness there's no way you won't go back to Doodle Loot for at least a second lick. From the rambunctious \"Meter\", the album smoothes into denouement with a blissful postcoital melt. Despite the focus on sugary melody, these last five songs are about unanswered booty calls; somehow, after all his carousing, Luke (or rather, alterego Bing Ji Ling) hits a rocky road with the ladies and can't find the right flavor. \"Where Is Your Love\" is a bittersweet psychedelic soul ballad buttered by ambient synths and lush vocals, and the almostacoustic \"You\" is a doowop lament of lost love and failed reconciliation skipping along over a chunky funkhop rhythm. It all comes to a surprisingly tender finale with \"Time to Breathe\", as Luke/Ling woos, \"Time to breathe has taught me/ I can never get enough of your love.\" When the music comes to a swooning stop, check out the ridiculously clever CD packaging: the inside features five separate makeout scenes a pint of empty \"Bing Ji Ling Ice Cream\" in the foreground of each while the outside is a fivepanel spread of a longlocked, customairbrushsuited Luke doing the disco at his favorite scoop shop. Mixing Ben & Jerry's instrumental density with snowcone sweet lyrics, Doodle Loot balances the chocolate with the vanilla and makes for one delicious swirl. "}
