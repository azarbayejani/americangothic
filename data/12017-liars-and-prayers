However, the reemergence of Bostonbased Thalia Zedek who, in her twodecade career, has shared stages and/or collaborated with all those mentioned above does not trigger the same feelings of nostalgia that greet her recently resurrected peers. And it's not just because she never enjoyed the same, fleeting bouts of MTVabetted crossover success, but also because her music most notably, with underrated 90s bluespunk grinders Come was too stridently unsentimental to soundtrack any wooltoqued teen's brand new love. Rather, Zedek's songs documented a struggle to avoid sinking into the same ol' shit: lies, betrayals, and redemption that never comes.In the wake of Come's turnofthedecade dissolution, Zedek's first three solo albums 2001's Been Here and Gone, 2002's You're a Big Girl Now and 2004's Trust Not Those in Whom Without Some Touch Of Madness retained her former band's drifty, openended approach to composition, but greatly tempered their scabrous, twinguitar attack into a more subdued guitar/viola/drums trio setup (a la The Dirty Three) to better illuminate the wistfulness that always underpinned her dirtyashtray voice. But after years of strippingdown, Zedek is ready to power up again, her latest album appending the word \"Band\" to her name and supplementing her usual cast of David Curry (viola) and Daniel Coughlin (drums) with bassist Winston Braman and, most crucially, pianist Mel Lederman.Liars and Prayers' hefty sevenminute opener \"Next Exit\" provides an instant compare/contrast between Zedek's old and new aesthetics, the band providing an ominously quiet, instrumental preview of the song's verse/chorus cycle, before crashing in at the 80second mark in full, stormy Bad Seeds swing and setting the stage for Zedek's blackcloud lyrics (allegedly inspired, like the album title, by life during Dubya's wartime, following in the tradition of Come's oblique Clintonera critique Don't Ask, Don't Tell). However, the newly acquired \"Band\" mantle reflects not just the weightier sound, but also Zedek's generosity of spirit: Liars and Prayers is Zedek's heaviest, most tumultuous album since her Come tenure, but she rarely leans on her guitar for cathartic effect, instead summoning Curry's dissonant string swirls, Lederman's forceful keystrokes, and her bolstered rhythm section to drive setpieces like \"Do You Remember\" and \"Body Memory\" into torrential midsong jams that break down and cohere at just the right moments.The band can't always make epics out of Zedek's matteroffact narratives \"Wind\" is interspersed with foreboding builds that don't quite jibe with the song's cowpoke pace and placid, pastoral imagery but like her old friend J Mascis, Zedek's sandpapered vocal cords can make plainspoken, seemingly throwaway lines sound deeply affecting: when she cries, \"And I know that I tried to call you/ But it was very haaaaarrrrd,\" (\"Do You Remember\") you can practically see her in some rainbeaten phone booth, scrambling for a spare quarter. But there's also the growing sense on Liars and Prayers that Zedek is getting tired of apologizing for past mistakes, and it's only a matter of time before resignation turns to rage: on the searing closer \"Begin to Exhume\", Zedek's contorted guitar screech and raspy wail assume complete control tellingly, she sounds most alive when railing against the Iraq war's wasted dead before her last spiteful words stop the song on a dime just shy of the sixminute mark. Liars and Prayers' success is owed as much to the band as its leader, but in the end, there's still no doubt about who's working on whose watch.
