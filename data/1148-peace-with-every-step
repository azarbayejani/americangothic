New Year's Eve 2004: I skittered down to Elk Grove, Calif., on Highway 99 with rain boiling my windshield; obscuring my view save for suburban neons, crimson taillights, and scant highlights of freeway signs only legible from 10 feet away. I was concentrating not on the road but on an office door that I forgot to lock before I left for the weekend; my mind was so focused that I felt I was standing by that door waiting for myself to show up. During that drive, Build an Ark's mantra of \"You gotta have peace and love\" seemed poetic and meaningful not that it was ever shallow before. The Ark recorded their antiwar opus, Peace with Every Step, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The L.A. collective boasts 20 Latinfolk and Afrogroove musicians and singers, all rotating duties on songs that range from duets to drumcircles to allhandsondeck jams. Among the ranks are 1970s Black Liberationjazz vets like percussionist Derf Reklaw (the Pharaohs), exMotown trombonist Phil Ranelin (Tribe), and vocalist Dwight Trible (Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra). Together, Build an Ark emulate the pantheistic awe of Sun Ra and John Coltrane. Leftfield hiphop producer Carlos Nino (Ammoncontact) helms the street fair that only ends when the National Guardsman come. The music mainly dwells on the psychgroove tip: Rhodes chords bathe the skies in indigos and golds, brass sections introduce the gospel in veteran's hospitals, and congas and trapkits keep the dancecircle going through dawn and dusk. Hell, they made my New Year's predicament of facing certain death seem like a swinging time. Opener \"You've Gotta Have Freedom\" would make any agrophobe shake hands with everyone who enters a subway station. The tune grooves in a steady bebop cadence with Nate Morgan's Rhodes telling everyone that better days are ahead, ecstatic chants of \"You gotta have peace and love,\" and Joshua Spiegelman's bass clarinet stands in a corner, sees the Light, and then speaks in tongues. \"Vibes From the Tribe\" paints a Latingroove in pure Technicolor with Ranelin and Spiegelman quipping \"you outta know something\" phrases on trombone and flute. \"Conversations\" and \"Precious, Priceless\" perform a fine, wartime blues as Morgan shimmers his Rhodes like twosecond newsclips of butcher's bills in Iraq. \"Don't you feel our wailing?/ Can't you see our cries?/ Our glass is empty/ Oh, please be wise,\" Trible croons to the selfproclaimed guardians of the Free World. \"Love Is Our Nationality\" could be the Ark's most polarizing trac: Peter Harris delivers a pacifist proclamation, ordering soldiers to \"strip off your uniform/ Salute your equal...put down your gun and pick up your baby.\" He then declares, \"We are sweettalking freedom fighters/ We are literary to curious children.\" Many people could dismiss Harris and the rest of the Ark as hippies who'd answer an enemy attack by blowing bubbles at them. But there is strength in his voice that cannot be denied it's a conviction that can cause warrior societies to fear for their children as their parents view peacetime as deadtime. Baba Alade then picks up a guitar to give a soulful rendition of Willy Wonka's \"Pure Imagination\" where utopia now goes beyond all edible materialism. It's a great power. "}
