The Tour\" trotted Providence heroes Lightning Bolt and Arab on Radar around the country, sparking a wave of jawgaping press coverage. But if that was The Year Noise Broke, it was also the year Arab on Radar Broke squabbling, disbanding, and eventually dispersing into two neighboring camps sharing only the old 'Graft home. The Chinese Stars, which combined AOR vocalist Eric Paul and drummer Craig Kureck with former Six Finger Satellite guy Richard Ivan Pelletier, dropped first with Turbo Mattress in 2003, and struck again over the summer with another EP,  T.V. Grows Arms; now Made in Mexico, featuring Radar refugee guitarist Jeff Schneider, get their crack at the postpostrock spoils. In their heyday, Arab on Radar looked a strong Devo influence in the eye and said, \"Yes, but we are still men.\" A semenobsession followed, detouring only for sodomy (and hardons). While they irked some with misogyny and scatology, worse was nihilism so thick it denied \"Satisfaction\" no matter where it came from. Undoing what Devo had already undone, they ended in a gimmick bind so thick that their constricted and jerky onstage shtick read as metaphor. The Chinese Stars, last checked, were digging deeper into this kind of nothingness; on Zodiac Zoo, Made in Mexico have only begun to Uturn out of the dirt. Arab on Radar walked the walk but backed down like schoolyard bullies; their website, circa 9/12, read, \"In light of the events now taking place at this point in history Arab on Radar feel that it is important that we address the issues surrounding our band's name.\" Made in Mexico, another nominal provocation, here stuck to its guns. \"Clockwork\" deadpans on Erase Errata basslines, but brakes for the breakdown: \"We're keeping the rich and fat/ Rich and fat/ And the ones more meek/ And the ones misused/ Are the trash.\" Singer Rebecca Mitchell stutters halfway between the raw enunciation of Lydia Lunch and something more sweet maybe 'cause she knows it helps. \"Farewell Myth\" puts it like, \"They don't need words/ They have voice/ Through their terms they organised/ By their terms they rise so high;\" this is why she screams one half and sings the other.  But the other three dudes (in true Radar fashion) still shuck and jive in and out of Schneider's trademark aluminumnecked, metal on metal on metal screech. The chaos, with its pingponging bass and snare doubling every guitar hit, wears out what's worn out: \"Infrared Eye\" rips on a lowchugged bass, \"Occams Razor\" rides shotgun on the same idea, \"Solanas\" buries it. Only once do they lose the straightjacket for solos and free association, on \"Face of the Earth\", which unchains the highend from the poor carthorse 1 2 3 4 repetition it's been stuck to since Schneider learned guitar from whatever factory machine taught him. Big up noise that remains loyal to rock's two or threeminute mark. But constantly just fucking sound jeopardizes what they look to save (songs, about stuff, I think). \"Black Rabbit\", according to Schneider, means to be \"the 21st Century answer to 'White Rabbit' now that we are sure the world is not going to survive much longer\": Dudes, stop trashing what taught you to trash.
