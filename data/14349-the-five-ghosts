{"label":" Vagrant / Soft Revolution","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/15404/homepage_large.480d8ff4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Stars","title":"The Five Ghosts","text":" Stars have never done \"small\" very well hell, I don't think they've ever done it at all. The Toronto act, now entering their second decade, have built a reputation on filtering tragedies of the heart through a widescreen lens, most excellently on 2004's Set Yourself on Fire. Even 2007's theatrical In Our Bedroom After the War exquisitely mired itself in misery, sounding more like 13 takes on the Smiths' \"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\" than the original cast recording of Gypsy.Simply put, then: They know bombast and melodrama, which makes a decent amount of their latest effort, The Five Ghosts, all the more offputting. For the first time in the band's career, they sound defeated. There's not much urgency, or even a range of emotion, for that matter; rather, much of the record blurs together, forming a single streak of gray. Telling, too, that the more upbeat cuts are the highlights. \"I Died So I Could Haunt You\" and \"How Much More\" both deserve a place among Stars' best work, with the latter working itself into a serene build that sounds like a thousand rockets taking off all at once.Otherwise, this is a sluggish record, and a good deal of the blame rests on the production. The mix seems so muddy and poorly executed that you have to wonder who signed off on this stuff. \"Fixed\" may sound like it's intended to be this album's \"Ageless Beauty\", but where that song's shoegazed guitars burned brightly, here the buzzy melody ends up sounding as neutered as the song title suggests. The more dynamic instrumental lines are frequently buried in the mix at the expense of bringing out Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan's voices. Campbell aims for an overdue cathartic wail near the end of \"He Dreams He's Awake\" but slams into a mess of tangled vocals and drums. At his best, Campbell's always been a charmingly corny vocalist; not allowing him his hammy release here takes away his greatest strength as a performer.Surprisingly, though, the middling sound ends up benefitting Millan's vocal performances greatly, affording her breathy coo the bright glow that it's been missing throughout the band's career. On previous releases, her voice has acted as not much more than a prettysounding foil for Campbell's, but on this record's best cuts, she sounds like a true frontwoman. She hugs the midtempo melodies of \"Wasted Daylight\" and \"How Much More\" tightly. Millan also is featured on the album's finest moment, \"Changes\". Her voice burns with patient regret, as the rest of the band finds their shimmering sweet spot and turns what, in another act's hands, could've been a dull, drummachined shuffler into the Canadian indiepop equivalent of Fleetwood Mac's \"Storms\". Stars may spend most of The Five Ghosts resembling sonic equivalents of the album title, but \"Changes\" is all flesh and blood, as well as a suggestion that, even after 10 years, this band ain't quite dead yet.
