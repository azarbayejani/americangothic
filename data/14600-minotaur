On 2005's Strange Geometry, they shifted focus for real, looking to the rich analog sound of the 1960s rather than the scrappy 1980s indie pop that reared them (which was of course already pretty 60sindebted).The Clientele are too idiosyncratic to be a straight retro act one listen to Alasdair MacLean's sighing delivery and you know he's not out to imitate Lennon, McCartney, anyone but that same strong stamp of personality means it's hard to say anything new about the band. So yes, on Minotaur they continue draw deeply from 60s softpop; if you've enjoyed the Clientele's last few albums, you're guaranteed to enjoy at least 6/8ths of this mini LP. It's the same gorgeous, heartsicksounding, consciously nostalgic, folkish rock you can imagine jangling from some shy bookworm's transistor radio in the brief period between Rubber Soul and the Summer of Love. On the plus side, the band has ditched the ersatz Brit Invasion touches that marred 2009's Bonfires on the Heath. The Clientele, despite their unfair reputation as a onetrick band, can do many things well, but they just sound off when they go uptempo.But Minotaur also includes the first Clientele song you could actually describe as \"creepy.\" There's a brief piano instrumental somewhere between Vangelis doing a slowmo Chariots of Fire and Komeda's Rosemary's Baby incidentals that hints at said creepiness. But it's \"The Green Man\" a spokenword track, MacLean's twist on the \"Green Man\" tradition of classic Brit ghost stories, that takes off from the far sunnier \"Losing Haringey\" on Geometry that sounds very little like anything the Clientele have released so far. The backing track is almost musique concrète, a wash of eerie drones, distant footfalls, and industrial sounds, as if it were recorded from a subway platform at 3 a.m. Musically, \"The Green Man\" is more akin to lateperiod Coil than anything you'd find on a Time Life \"sounds of the 60s\" collection, and while it's probably a oneoff experiment for the band, it also suggests that a little darkness might add a new (if not really necessary) dimension to the Clientele's sound.
