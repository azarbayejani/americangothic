{"label":" Columbia","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/1051/homepage_large.2cca703a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"The Byrds","title":"The Essential Byrds","text":" Someday, some enterprising soul will establish a code of etiquette for naming these career retrospective collections. Essential, Greatest Hits, Best of, Classics and several less common but no less boastful titles are used largely interchangeably as it stands, and record companies are especially loose about throwing these terms around in hopes of snagging a few stray dollars from consumers who don't see any inherent value in the artists' original albums.Essential is the title that gives me the most pause, though, considering how vaguely the term is used. You can take it to mean that all of the material that made the compilation is essential, or you can take it to be more absolute, meaning \"here's the essential stuff buy it and you're set.\" By the first standard, this latest in a string of dozens of Byrds retrospectives is mostly a success; by the second standard, it's a complete failure. Nearly every song on this twodisc set warrants inclusion on some basis, though disc two is somewhat weighted down by Columbia's insistence on including at least two tracks from every one of the band's albums for the label, including the hideously overproduced Byrdmaniax and the scattered Farther Along, the albums which precipitated the band's ultimate collapse. The band's final albums, to put it lightly, are for hardcore fans of the band's second, more countryinspired phase, and not territory for curiosityseekers to be wandering onto. When you consider this set as a whole, that loss of momentum is especially problematic, as it leaves you with the aftertaste of the songs most lacking in luster. Perhaps a better title would have been Overview, or at least Anthology. Really, I could sit here and complain for paragraphs about the fact that they missed \"You're Still on my Mind\", \"I Know My Rider\", \"One Hundred Years from Now\", and \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", among dozens of other fantastic songs hiding in the band's catalog. But gripes aside, there's more than enough amazing material here to serve as proof that The Byrds were one of the greatest bands of their era. The first disc doesn't slip at all bookended by the band's definitive versions of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"My Back Pages\", it's sixteen undeniable classics parked right next to each other; you can almost hear the roots of every band that ever jangled spreading the through the soil of rock. In just three selections, this compilation makes the case for Gene Clark as a colossal songwriter, and his \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\" and \"She Don't Care About Time\" are enough to make me wish he'd written a thousand more. The band's exhilarating turn into psychedelia, \"Eight Miles High\", still sounds just as towering today as it must have back then, standing next to The Who's \"I Can See for Miles\" as rock's best early flirtation with openended improvisation within an otherwise conventional song form. Roger McGuinn's stunning twelvestring solos echo the exploratory sax of Coleman and Coltrane and blow the doors off anything else I can think of that was happening in mainstream rock in 1966. The goofy pop of \"Mr. Spaceman\" and \"So You Want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" is excellent, though the songs sound a little slight in comparison to bassist Chris Hillman's gloriously Beatlesque \"Have You Seen Her Face\" and the dark, beguiling Crosby/McGuinn tune \"Renaissance Fair\". The second disc kicks off with perhaps the most inspired, unexpected choice on the set, the fantastic Crosbypenned single \"Lady Friend\", a tune that truly warrants the \"essential\" label, even if the band never saw fit to put it on an album. But from there, things get a bit less even, as the band became more erratic with each lineup shift that followed Crosby's departure. Certainly, their first postCrosby album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, was every bit as good as their earlier records, highlighted by a pair of Goffin/King covers (\"Goin' Back\" and \"Wasn't Born to Follow\", both included here) that marked a flirtation with Spectorish Wall of Sound sonics. The following year, the arrival of Gram Parsons in the band's ranks sparked a shift into country that lingered even after his departure to found The Flying Burrito Brothers with Hillman. Opinions vary widely on the direction the band took following the dissolution of the original lineup, but it's hard to deny that Sweetheart of the Rodeo is one of the best country albums ever recorded, which is why it's curious that only two songs from it show up here. Parsons' \"Hickory Wind\" and their cover of Dylan's \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" are estimable songs, but it's a meager offering from such a rich album at the very least, \"One Hundred Years from Now\" should have made the cut. The stinginess of the Sweetheart offerings would be forgivable if there was much that followed that feels right taking its place. As it happens, \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" is the band's best lateperiod song, but... \"Jesus Is Just Alright\"? Their version is okay, but and how often can you say this? The Doobie Brothers did it better. Otherwise, \"Chestnut Mare\" (from 1970's Untitled) is fun, and \"Tiffany Queen\" (from their 1971 swan song Farther Along) is a fine last gasp, but in the harsh light of what's come before it, it can't help but sound slightly dull. I don't know that I can recommend against picking up this set, but I'd say that if you can do it, buying the remastered, augmented versions of the band's first six albums is a much better investment. The Byrds were hugely important for all kinds of reasons, from their simultaneous embrace of folk and electric instruments, to their psychedelic experimentalism, to their mastery of countryrock, and a good sampling of the songs that made them important is available here. Whether or not it makes it to your shelf depends mostly on your appetite for The Byrds if one release is all you're ever going to get, this one would be hard to beat. "}
