It's a community of musicians popularly known to be directed by a twoheaded beast, the madman and the sober prophet, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Osbourne \"King Tubby\" Ruddock. \"Digital music\" is shunned as artificial by fetishists. \"These Fetishists are nothing more than pallid traditionalists\" is the secret message delivered by these 15 tracks, a message encoded in bass. This compilation comes at a terribly appropriate time. The collective consciousness of the electronic music scene has advanced to a point where they can finally recognize the contribution of reggae music to their own production techniques. These producers are looking for something else: a \"Now Thing.\" The artists represented on this collection come forth as serious innovators of the dub music style. They've managed to incorporate the heaviest aspects of dance music into crashing anthems and psychedout battle cries. It seems almost impossible, listening to these tracks, that this kind of music could be released in this day and age without anyone knowing about it. The joy of hearing something new is accompanied by a sense that you're getting a gift. \"Z2010\" by Lenky impresses such a sense of urgency on the listener. With its distorted melodies and a vocoded voice chanting \"madness... madness... madness...\" throughout the length of the song, it's easy to imagine the type of scene that could accompany this music, which sounds like Timbaland creating propaganda music for the Government. Similarly, \"Grass Cyaat\" by Richard Browne has a repetitive chant of \"fever,\" which has an even closer apparent relationship to hiphop music, thumping with spedup synthlines and sloweddown bass. \"Jigga\" by Slam Productions samples JayZ's rendition of Scarface: \"OK!\" These affirmations are beautiful reminders of the grinding desire by these producers to move people physically. The organ and synthesizer sounds pervasive on these songs demonstrate the amazing ability of present technology to effectively reference tone and melody in an interesting manner. These artists, like Steely & Cleevie, fucking kill it on \"Nightcrawler,\" a death walk track with a shouted \"hey\" and unintelligible echoing garbles, bassheavy and menacing. The synth sounds evoke high danger. The connections to the original Holy Dub Music which brought this all about is apparent throughout the song selections: the rhythms are constant reminders of the genre's roots. Now Thing is Perry and Tubby through a digital guise, a literal transformation of time. The beauty of the music lies in the intersections between its stark originality in beat construction and precise melodic and bass constructions, and its ability to properly reference its nascence in Jamaican ska and reggae. Perhaps it's the inability of most contemporary producers to properly achieve the latter. In any event, this document will prove influential to all those who hear it. May the gospel of the Now Thing be spread amongst all willing participants. The tools are all present and reliable: vocoders, reverb, echo, bass, drums and uncompromising rhythm. Do not let these cries go unheard. "}
