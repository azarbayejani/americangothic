While news of their reunion in 1989 had critics and old crusties on the edge of their seats, the general public wasn't quick to respond with similar adulation they were easily overshadowed by the rise of disciples Green Day, the dubious return of the Sex Pistols, and the corporatized copyists that would send punk tunneling back underground. Of course, the Buzzcocks, in its current incarnation, continues to release solid albums and tour every few years, regardless of critical or public opinion, and if few fans were clamoring for it to see wider rerelease, perhaps their first reunion LP, 1993's Trade Test Transmissions, will gain more attention in retrospect. Songwriters Pete Shelley and Steve Diggle had been recording experimental music in their time away from the Buzzcocks, but TTT was a return to the overdriven chords and campy melodies of their bestloved work. TTT does show Shelley and Diggle (a new rhythm section was in place by the time of recording) nearly as capable as performers as they were in their heyday, but it doesn't show much more than that. By no means is it a bad album: Tight tracks like \"Do It\" and \"TTT\" balance melody and bite. But Diggle gets much more time in front of the microphone here than before notably on \"Isolation\", with strong vocals and one of TTT's best melodies but Shelley always was the superior showman. Songs like those and \"Innocent\" echo some of the kick of the band's older work, and \"Palm of Your Hand\" makes for a particularly spirited retread (the best topics never age). Unfortunately, in playing it loud but safe, Trade Test Transmissions says little more than, \"We're back\": More than a decade on from their peak, the Buzzcocks weren't taking the creative chances of songs like \"Why Can't I Touch It?\", nor packing the wallop of early triumphs like \"Orgasm Addict\", \"What Do I Get\", \"Ever Fallen in Love\", or any of the countless others. This reissue adds material from the album's accompanying singles as bonus tracks, giving new listeners a glimpse of the Buzzcocks' stillhungry performances at the time. Along with Shelley's \"All Over You\" (available on the earlier American release), new inclusions like \"Trash Away\" prove their live chops, and hardrockers \"Libertine Angel\" and \"Roll It Over\" add a dash of keyboards and loads more guitars, with hooks that improve on most of the original album. In that respect, this edition deserves credit for further documenting the band's sincerity and veracious performances after years outside the limelight. Still, the album remains a strictly diehardsonly affair. "}
