{"label":" Merok","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/17185/homepage_large.e4f5b79d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Emilie Friedlander","artist":"Deptford Goth","title":"Youth II EP","text":" Deptford Goth is the solo electronic project of Daniel Woolhouse, a 27yearold, British art school graduate who made his debut last year after uploading a single track, \"Real Love Fastasy\", to his MySpace. Up until a few months ago, when he began work on his debut LP for Merok, Woolhouse was working as a teacher's assistant in a primary school in South London widely recognized as the birthplace of dubstep, and home to a few, betterknown singerproducers like James Blake and Jamie Woon, who offer a similar hybrid of sluggish club beats, expressive samplecutting, manual key work, and processed vocals. The project's name is deceptive. Woolhouse doesn't live in the Deptford district of London but in nearby Peckham, and he's no more of a \"goth\" than fellow bedroom producers like Holy Other, oOoOO, and Balam Acab although they do share an affinity for melancholy glamour and chintzy romance. At a time when cultivating an air of mystery has become one of the most transparent PR moves in the business, we can read Deptford Goth's selfbranding attempts in one of two ways. Either he is being halfhearted about it, offering up a few easy signifiers for \"dark\" and \"dubsteppy\" in an effort to bait fans of the Tri Angle/Merok contingent, or he is being overly selfconscious and trying to make a statement about how easy it is to get a certain group of people to pay attention these days. The good news is that Woolhouse seems to have put a lot more thought into the four, quietly actionpacked synthpop numbers on Youth II, his first EP. For someone whose stated roots are in acoustic music, his use of crooked drum programming, buttery synths, and soulful background crooning shows economy and restraint. These qualities are especially evident on downtempo opener \"No Man\", which is full of pregnant pauses. This is music that builds through the addition and subtraction of small details, such as a melismatic glitch in Deptford's de facto AutoTune voice, or the zippy, melody that kicks in midway through album single \"Real Love Fantasy\" a chirpy trance homage to Mariah Carey's \"Fantasy\". \"Time\", by far the EP's standout, contrasts rocky beats and bass wobble with a very largesounding synth melody. Vague existential musings about a deadend relationship (\"I don't know where I'm going/ Guess I'm leaving/ Time keeps pushing me\") trade off with an almost celebratory refrain: \"I'm a believer.\" As with the similarly worded mantra at the close of John Maus' recent We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves, the song's poignance hinges on the impossibility of taking it completely seriously, as the words come from a processed voice that is midway between human and machine. EP closer \"Youth II\" offers another tragicomic slice of technologically mediated emotion, contrasting his clipped vocalizations with oceanic synth chords that ultimately say so much more. Like electronic soul stylists to whom he is compared (writing for the The Guardian, for example, Paul Lester invokes the \"spectral R&B\" of How to Dress Well and Holy Other and \"the dubstep pop\" of Messrs. Blake and Woon\"), Deptford Goth's music is partly about making music and selfexpression in general in the digital age, yet another soundtrack for lonely BitTorrent downloading and emoticonflecked sentimentality. If you're unfamiliar with this sphere, it's a stirring listen; if you know it well, it's less so. "}
