Their sound is, quite simply, rock. The Bay Area trio evokes the bluster of early Melvins, the poppiness of later Melvins, the loose limbs of Black Sabbath, and the dry tones of garage rock. Despite their formidable live reputation, Totimoshi sound somewhat measured on record. This is partially due to production. Helmet's Page Hamilton helmed 2006's Ladrón, which was bonedry to the point of sterility. Still, colors shone through: blues, pop, twang, acoustic guitar, blasts of fuzz.  Milagrosa paints more vividly with this palette. Hamilton again produced, this time with the help of engineer Tosh Kasai. Although the ingredients remain discrete, they spread out more dynamically here. In \"Milagroso\", a Jew's harp saucily tiptoes in the background like a whisper. Organ subtly backlights \"Little Bee\". Although the record never truly combusts, it beautifully balances guitars and drums, as Tony Aguilar's singing sits clearly front and center. The drum sound is a work of art. Snares snap, toms rumble, and the cymbal shimmer in \"Last Refrain\" is practically iridescent.  The performances are also richer than before. New drummer Chris Fugitt adds precision and taste; he punctuates the funky groove of \"El Emplazado\" with playful rimshots. Fugitt's grasp of space allows Meg Castellanos' bass to converse more fluidly with Aguilar's guitar. At first, his attack seems startlingly plain. His power chords, R&B flavored stabs, and bluesy solos are standard rock fare. Sometimes, as in \"Fall and Bound\", the songs are in fact vanilla. But Aguilar's timing is mostly perfect, laying back during verses, then accelerating into leads. The magic is in such subtleties tart singlecoil flourishes, ebb and flow of distortion, bittersweet backing vocals from Castellanos.  This newfound suppleness extends to the lyrics. The theme of compassion versus violence runs throughout: \"Sound the horn, for the light it has come to me/ With give you get, but with want you are never free.\" Images in the liner notes are likewise gentle: palm trees, a sunlit cemetery, a shrine to a deceased loved one. Album closer \"Dear\" wraps itself in strings, resignation, and hope: \"In the end I will lose you/ That I do know/ Perhaps our bodies as refuse/ Will feed a flower to grow.\" It reaches the luminous place that Charlie Sexton's Under the Wishing Tree occupied, the union of \"roots\" and \"rock.\" "}
