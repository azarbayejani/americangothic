Nothing fancy: just three prepolyphonic chirps, like a car alarm arming. Rhys, rather than castigate the hapless technology victim, merely quipped: \"That's a good song!\" Such is the aesthetic of the Super Furry Animals' selfdeprecating chief prankster, a grinning Wonka for absurdist pop candy and whizbang noisemaking. The title track to Yr Atal Genhedlaeth (an untranslatable pppun that means \"The Stuttering Generation\") is just nine seconds that, y'know, stutter as if to teach iPod Nation how scratched CDs used to sound. From there follow 10 songs about the Euro, rival MCs who drown their Corn Flakes in beer, and a dying lover endearingly nicknamed \"Pwdin Wy\", which means \"Egg Pudding\". All that, and it's less psychedelic than your average Super Furries' album, emphasizing songcraft and melody, and framed by Rhys' upsidedown lefthanded Velcroenhanced acoustic guitar and thriftstore Yamaha beats. De facto opener \"Gwyn Mi Wn\" eschews even the guitar, opting for airy overlapped vocals atop clanging cymbal 'n' drum samples. \"Ni Yw Y Byd\" flips through keys like your humble rock scribbler through Ffa Coffi Pawb 12inches he can't pay for, yet remains singsongy enough for its title (trans., \"We Are the World\"). Those demanding stillgreater quirkiness are directed to wistful \"Ambell Waith\", which rocks both carnoise synths and villagegreen trumpets. Then there's the straightforward powerpop of \"Pwdin Wy 1\", \"Epynt\", and \"Y Gwybodusion\", which guarantee uncomprehending elevatorride singalongs. I mentioned this is all in Welsh, right? The language barrier is easy to forget, despite Rhys's occasionally harsh Brithonic consonants, because much like the Super Furry Animals' 2000 Welshlanguage excursion, Mwng, this album strings together so much surfacelevel pop magnificence what Nietzsche called \" the whole Olympus of appearance\" that its lyrics are, to Englishspeaking listeners, beside the point. Thus Rhys can cover a Celine Dionworthy Welsh power ballad, \"Chwarae'n Troi'n Chwerw\" and we can raise our lighters none the wiser. All Yr Atal Genhedlaeth lacks is the unifying ambition of the great SFA records. That's understandable, given this album's casual nature. But the solo disc's offthecuff jollity befits Rhys's concert opener/closer: a preprogrammed elevatorsynth rendition of \"Just the Way You Are\". "}
