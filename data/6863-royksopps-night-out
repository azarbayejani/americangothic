The genre tag ubiquitously and properly applied to Röyksopp's brand of smooth, predawn electronicpop must forever endure overhyphenated allusions to its status as the turnoftheY2K highend retailshopping soundtrack of choice (uh, see?). Those who have heard Röyksopp's two albums, 2002's Melody A.M. and last year's The Understanding, won't be surprised to learn the Norwegian duo's live set is much better and more raucuous than hunching next to the speakers at yer local Crate & Barrel. And yet the live Röyksopp's Night Out EP isn't completely unlike that store's unnecessary baubles. Put it on your wedding registry: \"What Else Is There\", in which touring singer Anneli Drecker does a great impression of the Knife's Karin Dreijer's studioversion Björk impression, while Röyksoppers TorbjØrn Brundtland and Svein Berge lay out their template of clubthumping drum pads and Airy analogue synths. \"Only This Moment\" finds the frontmen coolly engaging in Depeche Mode mode with guest sighs/moans from the excellent Kate Havnevik. \"Poor Leno (Istanbul Forever Take)\" spreads open the original like a starless night sky, albeit dropping the vocals. An intense \"Remind Me\" rides fashionshow guitars, which work despite the replacement of Erlend Øye with a vocoder. And, yes, Röyksopp do perform Queens of the Stone Age's \"Go With the Flow\", the primary reason the Norwegian band's longtime fans will want this record. Its bleak deathwish lyrics and martial melody make surprising sense amid rocketpropelled synths and understated vocals, but the cover's still a curio when laid beside Röyksopp's superior, original compositions. Plus, the eightminute \"Alpha Male\" is the same lasersfiring space obelisk dropped on the What Else Is There? EP like, three months ago. Well, we already done reviewed that, and most people who wanted it probably already bought it. Like a $49.95 designer urn or a $79.95 lasagna pan, Röyksopp's Night Out EP is pretty but largely inessential. The uninitiated should pick up either of the fulllengths (or that stillgreat remix of the Streets' \"Weak Become Heroes\"). Nevertheless, the disc makes an argument for Röyksopp's downtempo even staunch rockists can appreciate: It sounds good live. OK, save your pity for another genre. Like maybe mainstream country. "}
