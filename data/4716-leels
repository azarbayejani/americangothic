{"label":" Emperor Jones","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/4659/homepage_large.2c68758c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Dahlen","artist":"Leels","title":"Leels","text":" The Leels have no edge. Even their name has no hard consonant sounds. Their music a mushy combination of folksy rock and avantpop squishes between your fingers as you dig for a clear hook or a percussive sound. The members of the band have obvious talent and a lot of ideas, but everything sinks into a pleasing ambience. It splats against your ears like the spineless sea creatures that crawl across its back cover. The members of the Leels Floridians Trey Connor of Meringue, and Home alumni Chris Sturgeon and Eric Morrison split the singing, songwriting and instrumental work. Each of the fourteen songs has its own, creative sound: the guitar and vocal effects on \"{{}}}{{},\" the lilting, lush melody of \"Arbor Day,\" or Sandra ShockleyLaden's gossamer flute backdrop on \"Throttle.\" \"Floridian Towel,\" with its strong chorus and guest Drew Blomquist's crisp drumwork, sounds like it could fit on the first Sea and Cake album, though the Leels don't reach that band's stealthy efficiency. Even though the ideas are impressive, it takes several listens to appreciate them. The album has an appealing sound slightly wistful, slightly ironic but it's not striking, and the instruments sound like they're wrapped in gauze: \"Throttle\" goes down so easily that you can overlook its best qualities. The production may appeal to people who like the carefully produced haze of, say, the Flaming Lips, but the Lips have more electricity. Maybe it's too easy nowadays to overlook nice moments like the clarinet solos on \"Be a Part of It,\" but the experimentation on this album almost seems de rigueur, and the inventiveness doesn't convey any excitement. The more straightforward songs are also a little limp: the breezy indie pop of \"Fortunesized\" and \"Mandatory Highsteppers\" has been done better elsewhere, and the classic rock material \"Odessa,\" which could have come straight off Workingman's Dead, or the cover of Van Morrison's \"Precious Time\" doesn't have the sharp vocals or crunchy guitar strumming that the style requires. The Leels let loose near the end, trying to milk a rock crescendo from the song \"Sailing Sister.\" But between the lethargic vocals and the somewhat muffled guitar line, it never takes off; listening to it is like watching a threelegged dog jump for a frisbee. The chorus of \"Sailing Sister\" also demonstrates the band's biggest weakness: the singing, and especially the harmonies. On songs like \"Odessa,\" the vocals are indistinct and whiny, and they warble out of pitch; the harmony parts are offkilter and painful. Many vocalists including the Lips' Wayne Coyne turn out great performances with (arguably) weak pipes, and the Leels have a resemblance to some other vocal antiheroes, such as Neil Young or Jerry Garcia. However, singers like these show more personality. The Leels aren't as expressive: sometimes they sound like they're singing from the living room couch, and other times they use too much ironic detachment. On \"Closer to Be,\" Morrison can't even get a rise out of the word \"piss,\" and the lyrics about his nonstatus as a rock star aren't as knowing or funny as they want to be: \"We know the star is someone that I'll call yours truly/ It's time to admit that I am the shit, or else Ima get unruly.\" Even a breezy, laid back album like this should sound like it could really put up a fight.
