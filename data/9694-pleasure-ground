{"label":" Load","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/9522/homepage_large.9f7ad3c1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Masters","artist":"Prurient","title":"Pleasure Ground","text":" Pleasure Ground is Dominick Fernow (aka Prurient) at his simplest and most powerful. Originally released on a double cassette by Fernow's Hospital Productions, the album contains four 11minute, hypnotically uncomplicated tracks. His black din and bruising screams continue to test ears, but Fernow's noise is never sloppy, hewing to repetitive patterns that build into trances. Calling this the most accessible Prurient album is like calling the Antarctic sun warm, but anyone who finds previous releases forbidding might be surprised by how much there is to latch onto here. Fernow begins with a piercing tone similar to the opening salvo on his last effort for Load, Black Vase. That record's siren rang for 15 minutes, but here crunching jolts quickly break up the dogwhistle spine of \"Military Road\". A lungstretching howl soon chimes in, extending a lone stanza (\"Will you miss the abuse/ The intimate violence/ The parade of bruises/ The badge of punishment?\") into a glacial mantra. Doling out his words in metered chunks, Fernow's singing mirrors the rhythmic lurch of his surrounding noise. \"Military Road\" sets a template that the rest of Pleasure Ground perfects: Long tones and extended screams sliced into simple patterns. These protracted pieces can be intense, but they're also surprisingly songlike, like threechord punk tunes stretched to painfully beautiful extremes. \"Earthworks/Buried in Secret\" follows with descending chords that bend and collapse under the weight of Fernow's firebreathing. Here he turns four words \"what of this destruction\" into a novel's worth of abstract vowels and consonants. His lyrics in the past have teetered between dark poetry and gothic cartoon, but on Pleasure Ground their simplicity is effective.  The album's final two pieces pull Fernow's approach into new territory. \"Outdoorsman/Indestructible\" is a Prurient first: A piece so quiet you actually have to turn it up. Over a distant rumble, Fernow moans a Haikulike description of burning paper falling to the ground. The music's restraint is similarly Zen even a final burst of singing sounds stoic, like an eerie calm after a storm. \"Apple Tree Victim\" is even better. Like a blacknoise version of Fennesz's \"A Year In a Minute,\" the piece loops distorted chords under Fernow's lyrics, which equate sexual climax with gory death. Prurient records can feel like footnotes to Fernow's engulfing live show, whose muscular workouts whittle arenasized metal to its purest core. But \"Apple Tree Victim\" captures his sweaty stage energy perfectly, and it's difficult to imagine Fernow topping it or the rest of Pleasure Ground anytime soon.  "}
