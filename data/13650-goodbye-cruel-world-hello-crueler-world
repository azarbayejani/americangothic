It's a lyric that perfectly sums up the band's place in a venerable tradition of countryrock hurtin' songs and their singular status within it.Sure, you've heard bands like Spider Bags before; on first contact, you'd swear they were some halfremembered mid1990s band that got lost in the collegeradio shuffle among the Silver Jews, the Grifters, and Ass Ponys. But it's been an awful long time since you've heard a band pull off this sort of southernfried sloppop with such charm, craftiness, and selfdeprecating wit. On their second album, Goodbye Cruel World, Hello Crueler World, Spider Bags reimagine Neil Young's Tonight's the Night as a Saturdaynight party album: They're bleary eyed and wobbly kneed, but they're going down on swinging (or, at least, swigging).Spider Bags' ragged but resilient spirit has made them heroes to Titus Andronicus, who have covered the Bags' signature song \"Waking Up Drunk\", though Bags don't share their New Jersey successors' penchant for burnitdown drama. But the songs on Goodbye Cruel World twist and turn more than you'd expect from a countryrock album, riffing on standard versechorusverse templates before introducing an even more rewarding, finalact changeup, whether it's the poignant pedalsteeled finale to the frontporch picker \"Swimmer on a String\" or the giddy stream of \"na na na na na\"s appended to the earlyReplacements trashpop of \"Dishrag\". Even the typical jukejoint raveup \"Long White Desert Rose\" upends the formula, revealing its chorus only during a sustained buildup in the final 90 seconds, and sending it aloft on a bed of \"ooh ooh ooh\" backing harmonies.Though Spider Bags have just two albums and a handful of 7\"s to the their name so far, the band's MySpace bio is quick to point out that its members have been playing in bands for 15 years, and Cruel World's best songs ruminate on their refusal to grow up, albeit with a wisdom and clarity that you acquire only in your mid30s: on the corroded janglepop of \"Hey Delinquents\", frontman Dan McGee plays an advisory bigbrother role to a younger generation of misfits, while \"Que Viva El Rocanroll\" is a sloshed, shouldertoshoulder lastcall waltz for those who really should know better than to stay out past 3 a.m. on a weeknight. And then there's the sevenminute colossus \"Trouble\", on which McGee owns up to a lifetime of deviancy before his mantric chorus line yields to a surprisingly nasty bout of wahwahpedal abuse. If there's a problem with Cruel World, it's that it never regains its proper footing after this monster jam; for an album that routinely inspires a certain raisedfist perseverance, the somber, Califoned pastorale \"Here Now\" is a bit of a bummer note to go out on. Sure, that album title sets you up for life's great letdowns, but Spider Bags' greatest attribute is making you believe you can rise above them. "}
