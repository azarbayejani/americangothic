{"label":" Modular","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/9713/homepage_large.2061aae2.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Softlightes","title":"Say No to Being Cool - Say Yes to Being Happy","text":"  My introduction to the Softlightes was the video for \"Heart Made of Sound\", the beaming title track of the SoCal quartet's 2006 EP. A stopmotion marvel directed by Kris Moyes, the threeminute clip spells out the song's childlike lyrics, Napoleon Dynamitestyle, with found household objects from PostIt Notes and paper clips to bananas, kitchen utensils, and shoelaces. It cleverly complements the gentle whimsy of a pianodappled acoustic number about, well, getting stuck in clouds and listening to trees. The Softlightes' debut fulllength extends that cutesy sensibility to other soft, light indie pop styles. Singer/songwriter Ron Fountenberry and bassist Kristian Dunn formed the group out of the pastelcolored ashes of previous project the Incredible Moses Leroy, which folded following 2003's somewhat more soulful The Incredible Moses Leroy Become the Soft.Lightes, helmed by Beck drummer Joey Waronker. On the selfproduced Say No to Being Cool  Say Yes to Being Happy, the Softlightes at times become rather too saccharine, belying their naïvepop formulation. For all their softhearted subject matter, the Softlightes sound more like former labelmate Ben Lee or recent Flaming Lips than, say, the Boy Least Likely To. Their style is a pristine amalgam of sleepy acoustic guitars, restrained electronics, and Foutenberry's boyish, feathery voice. \"Girlkillsbear\" settles for recreating the Postal Service's Give Up with more awkward lyrics (\"You're like an army, baby/ When you start to cry\"), while \"The Robots in My Bedroom Were Playing Arena Rock\" is a silly detour into playful riffrock led by nonsensical vocoder vox á la Daft Punk. More typical of the Softlightes is the shambling folkpop of \"A Town Named Blue\".  The group's noroughedges aesthetic can't airbrush away some uneven songwriting. Yeah, \"Heart Made of Sound\" remains an evocative exercise in innocent pop, though its chorus (\"They want you, but they don't believe to want you\") still leaves me scratching my head. But \"The Microwave Song\" pins its hopes on an overblown chorus based on the inane mantra, \"I am just a microwave.\" Meanwhile, the childhood reminiscences of \"Leanor and Me\" with a spare bassline that hints at Bobby Darin's \"Beyond the Sea\" come off a bit rosecolored, as Fountenberry recalls, \"We were there when Johnny Lemon died... I didn't know his music yet.\" Cute pop can be an antidote to much of recent rock's selfseriousness, but the Softlightes' neutered approach too frequently cloys. Anything else good on YouTube tonight?  "}
