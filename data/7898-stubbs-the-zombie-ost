Natalie Portman: \"I was proved fucking right!\" Stubbs the Zombie, the videogame, is a thirdperson cerebellumgobbler starring Edward \"Stubbs\" Stubblefield, a longslain traveling salesman hungry for revenge (and brains). Stubbs' tonguecheeked horrorshow comes realive in a newsreelgrainy 1959 \"city of the future\" called Punchbowl. Stubbs the Zombie, the soundtrack, reanimates innocent late1950s and early'60s pop classics with presentday noises from stillbreathing Pitchfork review victims. While video game music has grown increasingly vital spawning remixes, orchestral concert tours, and cover bands video game soundtrack albums have often stayed as stitchedtogether as the living dead. Discs might include instrumental suites (Stubbs progenitor Halo), \"inspiredby\" progmetal (Halo 2), or vast assortments of licensed songs (Grand Theft Auto). While Stubbs isn't the first game soundtrack consisting of original pop/rock recordings earlier this year, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland challenged West Coast skatepunkers to exhume (and then attempt to cover) their punk forefathers it pairs a witty concept with mostly decentorbetter execution. Undeath becomes the unfunny recordings best at least outside of a game setting. The Walkmen imbue the Drifters' \"There Goes My Baby\" with their nowfamiliar windswept chill, restrained elegance echoing into raw anguish. Sockhop pianos still kachink around the edges, but singer Hamilton Leithauser's soused rasp reaps greater pathos by omitting the dated \"whoaohohs\" of the heartbreaking original. Similarly, Death Cab for Cutie loses itself in the slowdance sumptuousness of oftcovered \"Earth Angel\", Ben Gibbard's schoolboy tenor expressing the song's simple sentiment of affection better than it did the more deathobsessed material on Plans. Perennially overlooked, perennially Shinscompared Rogue Wave refashions Buddy Holly's \"Everyday\" with sad, subtle acoustic guitars invoking said comparisons better than the James Taylor version, even! Still, Stubbs's Punchbowl is a darkly ironic place (\"Drink your fill of the future\"). A number of songs nail the kitsch level appropriate given the game's gory, \"retrofuturistic\" setting. Chief among: Cake's understated \"Strangers in the Night\", with shameless schmaltzing, trumpet flourishes and a cannedsounding rhythm section. Flaming Lips could have recorded this delightful, surprisingly faithful \"If I Only Had a Brain\" in their sleep; from the sound of this rendition's cinematic flourishes, weird luciddream honks and munchkin giggles, maybe they did. Stubbs's context makes the tune sinister despite Wayne Coyne's ignorant/blissful scarecrowing. Oranger has fun, too, with a crunchier version of \"Mr. Sandman\", bumbumbums included. The Raveonettes also did their sexedup \"My Boyfriend's Back\" for this year's Pretty in Black, which weakens the soundtrack's claims about alloriginal content while strengthening its lineup. Too bad about the Dandy Warhols' nosepinched underwater \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\", though. Hey, Punchbowl ain't perfect (dude's snarfing brainstem, remember?) and neither is this soundtrack. Rose Hill Drive's Hendrixedup, chopsflashing corpsedragging of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates' Whopopularized \"Shakin' All Over\" is probably the worst offender. Phantom Planet offers up the album's lone new composition, \"The Living Dead\", and it's a sludgy, sneering rocker that sounds like it was commissioned for a video game soundtrack. OK oneliners, though: \"Here's some advice: Don't lose your head.\" Plus on \"Lollipop\" you get to hear Ben Kweller do the oohlollylolly cheekpop. Almost a reason to live. Again. "}
