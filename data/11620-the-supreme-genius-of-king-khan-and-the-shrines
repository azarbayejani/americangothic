{"label":" Vice","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/11383/homepage_large.93a68f30.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"King Khan and the Shrines","title":"The Supreme Genius of King Khan and the Shrines","text":" The fantastical tale of King \"Bama Lama\" Khan begins in 1995, when the Montrealborn son of immigrants from India (and selfprofessed grandson of the opiumaddicted \"Johnny Thunders of the sitar\") left home to play bass for the Spaceshits, a Crampslinked garagerock group fronted by Mark Sultan, aka future King Khan partner BBQ Show. A few years later, while in Germany Khan formed \"psychedelic soul big band\" the Sensational Shrines. By 2004, King Khan and the Shrines had played shows across Europe, along the way releasing not just a handful of 7\" and 10\" records, but also two fulllength albums: 2001's Three Hairs & You're Mine, which was produced by White Stripes engineer Liam Watson, and 2004's Mr. Supernatural. Most people didn't hear about King Khan and the Shrines until last year, when What Is?!, their most recent LP for German label Hazelwood, seared the band's combustible combo Stax plus Nuggets plus hisscovered indierock screwiness onto listeners' collective noggins. It was as if they were the Dirtbombs on simultaneous James Brown and Sun Ra kicks, or Black Lips with less of the Viceready comedy and more underlying pathos. Now signed to Vice, King Khan and the Shrines present a few of the best tracks from What Is?!, along with some of their earlier cuts, on label debut The Supreme Genius of King Khan and the Shrines. Despite the appropriately overthetop title, it's not so much a Greatest Hits What Is?! has slightly better songs overall as a chronicle of how Khan became King. The strongest tracks, where the band's unhinged nostalgia meets not only squealing discord but also Khan's stupefying jester/soulman antics, appeared previously on What Is?!. Take nourishment from the Hammonddrenched soul foodstamps of \"Welfare Bread\". Hear Khan go howling mad and a step past girlcrazy amid the sitarlike guitar and wahwah pedals of \"I Wanna Be a Girl\". The stringtying absurdity of \"69 Faces of Love\", or the prickly dick jokes and \"Venus in Furs\" string drone of \"The Ballad of Lady Godiva\" are sadly absent, but the deafnessrepping James Brown of \"Land of the Freak\", the Stoogeian assault of \"No Regrets\", and the relatively sane redline retro of \"Outta Harm's Way\" are all present and accounted for, as they should be.  The seeds for that sound were sown long ago, as the older tracks on The Supreme Genius of show. The record opens where it oughta at a record store with the masochistic \"Torture\", originally from a 2000 7\". The \"she's fat, she's ugly\" chorus of 2001 10\" cut \"Took My Lady to Dinner\" loses its novelty sooner than some of the band's later ideas, and yet every time Khan sings about bringing home the bacon (or his special lady's Empire Statesized ass), well I just break down and laugh; queasy ballad \"Fool Like Me\", from the 2001 debut LP, finds similar redemption. \"Sweet Tooth\", off a 2004 split LP with the Dirtbombs, has the party ambiance of What's Going On, but it, like a few of the tracks on the second half of the album, shows a group not quite fully formed, lacking the selfawareness and depth of their best work. \"My heart is broke and I feel alone,\" Khan intones on 2003's \"Que Lindo Sueno\". Even at their worst, they're merely retro.  It probably bodes well for King Khan and the Shrines that their best days aren't already, uh, years behind them. If you're a newcomer to their cracked vintage universe, The Supreme Genius of should be an excellent introduction, the band as they currently want the world to see them. If you arrived with What Is?!, this one might not get as many spins, but it'll still provide important context and a couple of tracks you probably hadn't heard. And if you've been listening to these guys since the Spaceshits...why the hell didn't you tell anyone?!  "}
