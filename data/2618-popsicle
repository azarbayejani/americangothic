{"label":" Kemado","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/2595/homepage_large.2c6a493b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Adam Moerder","artist":"Diamond Nights","title":"Popsicle","text":" It seems a poor depth of quality touchstones hamstrings today's arena rock revivalists, or at least maybe those not named the Darkness. Unlike heady postpunk incarnates' expansive template, nu arena rockers cull their sound from an assortment of 70s singles rather than bands per se. We can compare Diamond Nights to Thin Lizzy, but in actuality, we're really just referencing \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" since the song practically encapsulates Lizzy's prolific yet standardized canon. Such emphasis on the feelgood anthemic hit can breed either disappointment or a monlithic sound over the course of an album, and likewise Popsicle tragically toils and troubles through almost 40 minutes of lusterless AOR for one \"hit,\" \"Destination Diamonds\", already exhausted on an earlier EP. I say tragic because Diamond Nights aren't the enemy here. Unlike Louis XIV, there's no dicksout chauvinism. Popsicle rarely even strives for anthem status, instead cruising on midtempo, digestible riffs and nicotineflavored vocals. However, Diamond Nights too often splurge on guitar shop showmanship, displacing hooks and originality with intrusive, unappealing features like fingertapped solos and Mixolydian modes. \"City of Love\" and \"Needle in the Rice\" sound like warmup exercises, tumultuously soaring through scales and vocal modulations with little onus on structure. The other half of Popsicle's tracks float in leatherstudded, ultracool pool hall exhaust. At best, the band drops the cock rock to dabble in more liminal genres, like on the skittish \"Drip Drip\". An almost Gang of Fourstyle staccato riff pecks through Morgan Phalen's volpine verses while Tim Traynor ssssputters on the skins, building to a pompous chorus \"ready for love.\" Once again, \"Destination Diamonds\", from the Once We Were Diamonds EP, makes a case for these guys as Cheap Trick torchbearers, but nothing else on the album makes good on the track's bashfully falsetto chorus hook \"Baby, do you like to mess around?\" Unfortunately, the more fetid leftovers from Diamond Nights's EP reek enough to overpower the newcomers. Amidst the rock numbskullery, acoustic numbers \"Ordinary Life\" and \"Snakey Ruth\" jumpstart Phalen's melodic side, though they're too little too late. Maybe I'm giving these guys too much credit, but babySabbath throwaways like \"It's a Shokka\" and \"City of Love\" dog what otherwise seems an intelligent (they use words like \"modicum\" for chrissakes!) although misguided group. Hopefully they'll soon realize most bands conjure up only one \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" a lifetime, and rather than waiting for that generationuniting, feelgood rocker, they'd best bend the arena rock aesthetic to its outer limits the band's real stomping ground.
