{"label":" Allegro Music","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/13137/homepage_large.7af2554b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Stephen Emmer","title":"Recitement","text":" On Recitement, the Dutch composer Stephen Emmer builds music around spoken literary texts. Because of that sentence alone, I'd wager that some of you are aiming for your browser's back arrow. Spoken word gets a bad rap in part because of a hoary yet persistent caricature: the fingersnapping, beretwearing, boho poet who declaims jive over noodly jazz or pofaced folk. This straw man is so pervasive in popular culture it gave us Maynard G. Krebs, Cool Cat, and Shaggy from \"ScoobyDoo\" that it's easy to forget the beatnik way isn't the only way.Recitement, which features Emmer's music supporting poems and stories of different eras, some of which are read by their original authors, does occasionally flirt with stereotype. Sometimes the results are enchanting anyway you can practically smell the clove smoke wafting through the smooth horns of \"Mondo Sparito\", which features Andrea Piovan reading from Alessandro Baricco's novel City and sometimes they're offputting. Emmer courts pigeonholing when he backs a reading by Beat archetype Allen Ginsberg with bombastic folkrock on \"Disconnected\", and Michael Parkinson hams up a lovely Thomas Hardy poem on \"Invergence of the Twain\".These few missteps emphasize how admirably Emmer succeeds in avoiding clich√© on most of the tracks, which are mainly arranged and played by the composer himself (with a bit of help from auxiliary musicians), and bolstered by Tony Visconti's limpid production. Emmer's miscellaneous musical career, which encompasses free jazz, rock, electronic noise (he was a member of the Factorysigned band Minny Pops), and points outlying, is reflected in the startlingly diverse music on Recitement. This breadth of capability allows him to achieve the most difficult trick of spoken word music: symmetry of form and content, with neither feeling subordinate to the other.So Yoko Ono's \"Listen, the Snow is Falling\" (sung by Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino) gets arctic dronerock that accentuates its stateliness; Lou Reed's humble rendition of an excerpt from Paul Theroux's travelogue The Great Railway Bazaar gets elegiac piano and strings that conjure stations streaming across train windows; Kurt Schwitters's seminal sound poem \"Ursonate\" gets syncopated avantjazz that draws out his nonsense language's decorative, expressive quality. Elsewhere, Emmer avails himself of hiphop, ambient, chamber music, and techno influences, always keeping his sights on the twin goals of sounding good and drawing out the resonance of his selected texts and voices.The best compositions create harmonious interplay between the various tiers that spoken word music contains: The sound of the voice, the sound of the words, the images the words embody, and the images the music embodies all dissolve into one boundless mass. On \"The Leaden Echo\", the late Welsh actor Richard Burton draws out the fleet rhythms of a stunning poem by the experimental Victorian poet Gerard Manley Hopkins; Burton's crisp, theatrical diction blends into a haze of swirling strings with a few subtle voice manipulations at certain enjambments. On \"Absolutely Grey\", jazz wordsmith Ken Nordine's rich baritone echoes itself in whispers amid camera whirs, sonar blips, and shifting percussion that helps him hover or surge without changing his inflection.The balance of poppy, purely musical tracks and esoteric, more sculptural ones keeps the record lively, and it has considerable archival value as well: For book lovers, the drowsy loungemusic strains of \"Everness\" are almost beside the point; to hear the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges reading in his native tongue is sufficient. Song lyrics are not poetry and poems are not songs, but that doesn't mean poetry and music can't agreeably coexist even, in the right hands, enhance each other as Emmer so convincingly asserts on Recitement.
