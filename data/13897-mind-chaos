Well, they sound like a mix of popular New York sounds from the last decade like the precise midpoint between the Strokes and LCD Soundsystem. Now, you could of course play \"spot the influence\" as easily with the Strokes and LCD Soundsystem, but they've both been so great at reshuffling the deck, it's hard to mind when the same card keeps coming up. Hockey, too, are pretty unabashed about whose notes they're cribbing from, but unlike so many selfserious Strokesalikes and partystarting miniMurphys, on their debut LP, Mind Chaos, Hockey seem to be having a little fun with it, keeping things casual, cracking jokes at their own expense. You'd be surprised how well it works.You need only make it to the chorus of opener \"Too Fake\" to see what I mean; it thumps and stutters to a start not unlike one of the talkier LCD tunes, \"North American Scum\" or \"Losing My Edge\", before sliding into a new wavey chorus that suggests the more sumptuoussounding stuff from the Strokes' First Impressions of Earth. There's just no getting around it; save a little It's Blitz!style disco sheen and some Hamilton Leithauser howl on a few of the vocals, Mind Chaos' first twothirds keeps things chatty but clearcut, precise but playful. Some tunes lean further to one side or the other, but until things get weird around \"Four Holy Photos\", you'd be forgiven if you thought iTunes was getting cute and snuck \"12:51\" over 45:33.Maybe it's criticproofing (it's certainly criticbaiting), but Ben Grubin's figured a way around any accusation that he's being derivative: He just comes right out and says it himself. The first song's called \"Too Fake\" (and even this approach is derivative, specifically of MGMT's bow \"Time to Pretend\"). But it's the knockout single \"Song Away\" that finds Rubin at his most egregiously selfeffacing; \"I stole my personality from an anonymous source,\" he claims on his \"truthful song over an 80s groove,\" and then, talking about himself, he's \"ahead of his time... if only he could prove it.\" All through the album, aside after amusing aside, Rubin paints himself as a clever kid with a knack for synthesizing smart ideas (mostly other people's) into something enjoyably breezy, well aware neither he nor his band are reinventing the wheel. It can feel impersonal and winking, having this guy defining himself against things rather than just expressing himself. But given the cloud of mope that surrounded so many Strokes acolytes in the earlier part of the last decade and the notasincisiveastheythink stance of most postLCD lyricsascommentary, Rubin's just seems to be having a laugh, and when he says stuff like, \"everybody's making dance music, true, but we started in 2002,\" on his debut record, you may well chuckle along.Of course, none of this would work without hooks to hang all the chatter on, and Hockey have quite a few; the blushing \"Work\" has shades of Phoenix at their more Strokeslike; \"Curse This City\" smacks of postfame the Rapture; and \"3AM Spanish\" comes across like Blondie at their most in tune to hiphop. It gets a bit dicey around gentle honkytalker \"Four Holy Photos\"; from then on, the sharp aesthetic on loan gets turned in, and we're treated to a mixed bag of notquitethere ideas that pales next to the bright lights of the big city chatterpop that precedes it. It feels like Hockey struggling a bit to carve out their own sound, as the songs around the back end do get more eclectic, a bit squigglier, a little harder to triangulate, cut with less humor, and a lot less good for it. They oughtn't have felt the need; the vintage threads of their forebears fit them so much better. "}
