{"label":" Merge","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/14364/homepage_large.10fdf6ab.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Paul Thompson","artist":"Destroyer","title":"Bay of Pigs EP","text":" \"So listen,\" Destroyer's Dan Bejar confides/boasts at the top of \"Bay of Pigs\", \"I've been drinking.\" It's a line you could affix to the front of just about any of Bejar's glamfolk tunes; he does, after all, tend to sing like he's trying to blow the last fleck of Chianti from his bottom lip. But here it is, leading off what's now Destroyer's longest track (by several minutes) in a catalog peppered with epics. The rumors were indeed true, as \"Bay of Pigs\" is in fact an \"ambient disco\" number, a couple of genres that even for the evereclectic Bejar seems oddly foreign on paper. I mean, Destroyer goes disco? The guy must've been under the goddamned table when he came up with that one.This sprawl, paired with that succinct, nearsummation of a first line oh yeah, and the dozenminute screed that follows makes \"Bay of Pigs\", if not the single best Destroyer song, certainly the ultimate. It's an exceptional work, a surrealistic epic rich in novelistic tone and texture and sometimes shockingly vivid in its imagery. But it's also a 13andhalfminute long Destroyer song in a spacey, eventually litedisco style, and it's rife with all the quirk and selfreference of your favorite Bejar song, and then some. An entry point for curious New Pornographers fans this ain't.The narrative is as troubled and prone to timelapse and footnotes as you'd expect from Bejar's longestever tome; the tune is ostensibly about the botched 1961 Cuban invasion, but for an aside or 12 our narrator cops to being 20 years old in 1992, throwing up in an English garden, his antlerwearing conquest all the while lost in the desert. And, hey, maybe there's Christine, stowing away from Destroyer's Rubies' \"Painter in Your Pocket\", to whom Bejar refers as the rageinducing object of his affections. Getting one's head around a tale this sinewy and sprawling is no easy task, and while Bejar's done exceptionally well in widescreen, the blowhard majesty of his compositions can wear one down after the third raveup. But \"Bay of Pigs\" feels about half as long as the actually halfaslong \"Shooting Rockets\" from last year's fine Trouble in Dreams, and, weirdly enough, it's the disco that keeps you from flagging out around minute nine.That said, don't go looking for your minimal dubstep Balearic whaddyacallit here; \"Bay of Pigs\" sounds like a synth rock band playing disco, and more specifically, like Destroyer playing disco, having never met a big build they didn't like. As such, the track burbles to a slow start, synths twinkling around Bejar as he explains away the booze on his breath. It's essentially one synth wash after another for a spell, swarming around Bejar's words before settling into a stuttery New Ordery synth pattern, a wet slap of a beat, and a little Spanish guitar. You'd look awfully funny trying to dance to the largely lowenddeficient first half or so, but \"Pigs\" gets a pretty good groove going about halfway through, pulling in all the elements from before and marrying them with a startlingly apt dancefloor refrain: \"Free and easy/ Gentle gentle/ The wind through the trees makes you mental/ For me\". The track stays out of Bejar's way when need be, helps carry over some of the wordier verses on the back of a thumpa or two, gets real good around the chorus, and then backs out slowly; it hangs onto the song like a rumpled sportcoat, the kind Bejar himself favors.Talk about your selfreference; on the flip of \"Pigs\" is \"Ravers\", a strippeddown, slowedup take on Trouble in Dreams' \"Rivers\". It took me a minute, honestly; \"Rivers\" was a fairly peppy tune about \"a standoff with the fucking horizon,\" more notable for its easygoing chorus melody than its words, but \"Ravers\" finds Bejar sounding pickled and determined as he moans those very same lyrics over an even spacier synth wash than \"Pigs\". To hear Bejar, who sounds almost like he's being propped up to get through this one, wail this one out into the ether is practically to hear a completely different tune, and he imbues the song's central lines with a lot more feeling and pathos than the livelier LP version. Bejar's long been a songwriter of the highest order and \"Pigs\", buttminded sonics and all, is one of his finest but his powers of performance and interpretation have nearly caught up in the last few years. Bay of Pigs draws a clear line under that part of the Destroyer equation, as both songs here owe their successes to execution just as much as his early work got by on intent. I'd assume Bay of Pigs' disco diversion to be just that in the long run, but after the relatively wagongathering summary of Trouble in Dreams, this certainly feels like a break and, perhaps, the first blush of something new. Cheers to that. "}
