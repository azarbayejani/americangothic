{"label":" Domino","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15635/homepage_large.cad62140.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Love","artist":"Chief","title":"Modern Rituals","text":" The guys in Chief grew up in California, but the band actually formed while three of them were attending NYU. That bicoastalism reveals itself neatly in the band's music. Modern Rituals, the group's fulllength debut, blends NY backbeats and jaded vocals with woolly West Coast harmonies and mellow vibes, and it works in the sense that Chief don't sound explicitly beholden to any single sound or style. But having disparate influences is faint consolation when you're less than the sum of your parts, and Chief fail to be more than an amalgam of other, better bands.At heart, Chief seem more or less like a bunch of hippies. Almost every song on Modern Rituals evokes a band of longhairs, whether it's the close, CSNY harmonies of \"The Minute I Saw It\" and \"This Land\", the stoned Meat Puppets deadpan that lead singer Evan Koga temporarily adopts on \"Breaking Walls\" (complete with spiraling My Morning Jacketstyled guitar figure), or the album's largely dippy lyrics, which hit their nadir on \"Summer's Day\" with Koga opining, \"I believe when I go/ You will cry tears of gold.\" Chief's one good trick is occasionally tethering these freefloating vibes to something moodier and more metropolitan. This is most often accomplished by Koga, who, when he's not channeling Meat Puppets' Curt Kirkwood, prefers to deliver a deep, halfslurred croon that's a polite approximation of the Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser. The hollow, lonely guitar lines and metronomic drumbeats of \"Nothing's Wrong\", \"In the Valley\", and \"Night and Day\" all balance out Chief's rootsy, LeftCoast somnolence with insistent NYC precision.Yet what appears to be Chief's greatest asset might actually be their Achilles heel. The transcontinental breadth of the band's influences keeps Chief from coming across as pallid piggybackers of any one scene, but for a group that hasn't yet demonstrated an ability to nail down a particular sound, keeping so many balls in the air could be stretching its talents too thin. Perhaps that explains why Chief are rarely better than competent at anything they try to do here. "}
