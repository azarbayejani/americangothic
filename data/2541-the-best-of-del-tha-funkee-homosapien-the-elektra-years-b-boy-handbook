{"label":" Rhino","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/2519/homepage_large.f4649799.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Rollie Pemberton","artist":"Del Tha Funkee Homosapien","title":"The Best of Del tha Funkee Homosapien: The Elektra Years: B-Boy Handbook","text":" Beginning his career in his cousin Ice Cube's group Da Lynch Mob, Del tha Funkee Homosapien has spent his career reinventing himself. Starting out as a militant slacker on his debut, he soon shifted to such personas as Slayer of Wack Emcees, Horrible Beatmaking Weirdo, Rappin' Nerd, and most recently, Absent Indie Rap Luminary. With such a storied history, you'd expect a greatest hits collection to actually include his greatest hits. When the fine print is read, though, something quickly becomes evident: He only released two albums on Elektra, neither of them being perfect.I Wish My Brother George Was Here and No Need for Alarm were far from bad records, but they were clearly two sides of a coin. The former fell short because failed to show his true personality and displayed too many of his younger and more ignorant opinions (\"Dark skinned girls are better than light skinned\"), though the latter succeeded on focusing on his rhyme skills and vocal quirks. This collection, unfortunately, focuses on Bsides and remixes, making it more of a completist's release than a greatest hits collection. Some are good (\"Burnt\", \"Wrongplace (Casual Remix)\"), some are bad (the ridiculously corny Judgment Night soundtrack amalgam with Dinosaur Jr. \"Missing Link\"), but the realization that the only great album tracks from his early days are \"Mistadobalina\", \"Dr. Bombay\", \"Wack MC's\" and \"Catch a Bad One\" is disheartening. This being an Elektraonly hits collection means that his best work from Deltron 3030, the obscure Japanese import masterpiece Future Development, and even Both Sides of the Brain go unrepresented. Given this, the exclusion of Elektra tracks like \"The Wacky World of Rapid Transit\", \"Boo Boo Heads\" and \"No Need for Alarm\" is inexcusable. The biggest win on this piece is doubtlessly \"Eye Examination\", one of Del's alltime best performances. Rocking over a chugging guitar and drum tradeoff, a psychedelic backdrop falls around Del, who details his mentality and lifestyle choices better than anywhere else in his catalog: \"I never had real friends 'til now/ I never had to steal ends 'cause that's foul/ I walk the streets with the baseball bat, feelin' secure/ But I try not to incite fights, that's immature.\" It's one of my favorite Bsides of alltime, and helps save this compilation from total irrelevance. What this labelsanctioned, contractfulfilling release proves is that Del came into his own near the middle of his career (Third Eye Vision, Future Development, Deltron 3030). Still, without the powerful straightrap from the majority of No Need for Alarm, this Elektraonly greatest hits package fails on its own concept. "}
