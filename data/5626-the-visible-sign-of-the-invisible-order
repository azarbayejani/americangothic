Just Google \"bukkake\" and then pray for your mortal soul's destiny. The selfcanceling album title doesn't help, and neither does the obligatory freakfolk vibe of songs titled \"Enter the Wang\", \"Hidden from the Hidden Ones\", or \"Pipestone Octopus with Horseheart\". If I never knew these fouls, then maybe I would consider the Master Musicians of Bukkake to be one haunting artifact unearthed from the crates of a Bangkok record shop/noodle house/bordello in the back. The Master Musicians is a motley assemble of 20 blokes from subterranean Seattle who generally perform lysergically poisoned impressions of Southeast Asian ceremonial music. Alan Bishop and Charlie Gocher of ethnodelic greats the Sun City Girls add some drums and Burmese banjo in there. Visible is best heard in one sitting as it follows a narrative from wearied peace to phantasmagoric horror to entrance to heaven. Opener, (cough, cough), \"Enter the Wang\" fires the gong with faint Asian pentatonic string scales letting everyone know that the curtains are drawn and much madness follows. \"Bukkake Sunrise\" first bleeds in what sounds like a cross being a machine eating a tape and rain on tin. Blues guitar melodies that overlook a dust bowl arise while tribal chants echo throughout, beckoning one out of slumber and tempting that person to crawl out his or her bedroom window to follow the sound. The earth then swallows up the seeker. \"Lucky Duck\" loosely recalls the Balinese monkey chant, as scattered Master Musicians arise from the ashes to curse in ululating chants all punctuated with tribal thumps. However, the melodrama kicks in with the following, \"Pipestone Octopus with Horseheart\" interrupts the album's flow with Residentsstyle orientialism with screeching and wails blown through the nose. The children's Halloween record vibe fares better on \"Horseheart Revolution\" and \"Black Bile\", where the chants are awash in the village fires. Midway through the LP, \"Hidden from the Hidden Ones\" gathers the delirium into a natural tension with a drum march to the sacrifice altar and Faustlike violin grindings driving the momentum. \"Custody's Last Battle/Secret Wars\" is the peak; gunshots pierce through an openair recording as dribbling percussion and screamed \"aiees\" flee the battlefield. An obligatory catharsis, I suppose. Closer \"Circular and Made of the Earth\" resolves the whole delirium with a feelgood ballad of accordion drones and sitarstylized banjos plucks in perfect tune with an enraptured bloke speaking in tongues. Cynics can consider this music to be another example of Westerners trying to be weird by exploiting \"exotic\" and \"mysterious\" Asian music. That accusation does have substantial evidence, but this music should not be dismissed so quickly. The majority of the music is still wellexecuted and can engross listeners with a sense of otherness. Just don't look up \"bukkake,\" for the love of God. "}
