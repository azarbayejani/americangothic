{"label":" Matador","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/12617/homepage_large.4c360ea1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Fucked Up","title":"The Chemistry of Common Life","text":" Whether it's their second release or their 60th (no one's even pretending to be sure), Fucked Up's The Chemistry of Common Life is really easy to get excited about. A lot's been made about how it could possibly revitalize hardcore, although framing it within genre terms tends to lead to the wrong questions: Is it too melodic and instrumentally diverse to qualify as hardcore? Maybe. Is it heavy and chaotic enough to satisfy fans of the debut, even while it dramatically broadens their fanbase? Possibly. Can a band as destructive as Fucked Up really carry an entire scene on their sweaty, unshaven backs? Stranger things have happened.It might seem counterintuitive to call Chemistry a grower: From the first listen, it's both pummeling and riveting. When frontman Pink Eyes (Damien Abraham) makes his grand entrance 1.5 minutes into the massive album opener \"Son the Father\", he channels G.G. Allin by way of Les Savy Fav's Tim Harrington, delivering fiercely intelligent lyrics in a singing voice presumably treated by years of guzzling Canadian Club and then eating the bottles.That said, The Chemistry of Common Life is a guitarist's album: 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk) and producer Jon Drew balance classic rock force with shimmering overdubs, at times recalling the Smashing Pumpkins, while at others echoing the layered, chiming guitars and famed loud/quiet dynamics of Bossanovaera Pixies. First single \"No Epiphany\" has 18 overdubs alone. Fractured harmonies bring \"Crooked Head\" to its cruising altitude, while breakneck opener \"Son the Father\" is almost tactile in its texture, with power chords and rich overtones busting into an armswingng chorus that doubles as the record's thesis: \"It's hard enough being born in the first place/ Who would ever want to be born again?\"It's a hell of a pace to sustain, particularly after the bongolaced battering ram \"Magic Word\", but Fucked Up get plenty of help: Chemistry is an \"it takes a nation of millions\" endeavor, born out of a sense of community and the determination to create something huge. According to the band, something along the lines of 70 tracks of instruments went into the making, as well as guest vocals from Vivian Girls and Sebastian Grainger (formerly from Death From Above 1979). It's not a situation where Fucked Up are seeking credit merely for beginning the album with a flute or other decidedly nonhardcore instruments. These touches often provide the most memorable moments: The gorgeous curtainraise of female voices that open \"No Epiphany\"; \"Twice Born\" and its shoutalong chorus (\"Hands up if you think you're the only one denied!\"); the mystic Black Mountainstyle duet on \"Royal Swan\".Along with a sense of community, the album also offers a refreshing take on religion. Fucked Up's spiritual bent is something richer than believers being targeted by secularists aiming to make them look stupid (there's your Religulous spoiler save the $10): Chemistry is questioning but rarely cynical, the album's midsection testing faith in the face of reason and science, and finding meaning in the actual search for answers (\"Days of Last\", \"No Epiphany\").Chemistry doesn't sit still, and perhaps paradoxically, its most palatable track might be its most divisive judging from the ringing openchords and insistent drum beat of \"Black Albino Bones\", you might get the idea that this is actually an indie rock album (oh yeah, it is on Matador), a forgotten Husker Du track, or god forbid, poppunk. Were it given a more conventional vocalist, it could easily sidle into MTV with more ease than this performance of \"Twice Born\". But while \"Black Albino Blues\" marks the album's most melodically uplifting track, it might be the most lyrically melancholy, furthering the message of the title track that the magic in our lives is still often a result of nature. \"It's the little things that get us through life,\" barks Pink Eyes before Dallas Green sweetens up with \"I need a little escape.\" This still being Fucked Up, it's a song about sex and drugs, but if they happened to leave something out of that eternal triad, it's only because The Chemistry of Common Life kicks enough ass to demand inclusion on its own terms.
