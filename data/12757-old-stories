{"label":" Midwich","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13736/homepage_large.e9ba5c4b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Mia Clarke","artist":"Nancy Wallace","title":"Old Stories","text":" A longtime fixture in the British contemporary folk scene, eastLondoner Nancy Wallace originally cut her teeth as a vocalist with the shambolic, fiddledriven folk collective the Memory Band before turning the musical spotlight on her solo material. Her debut album,  Old Stories, follows 2005's  Young Hearts  EP, which featured elegantly pastoral covers of disco anthems by the likes of Candi Staton, Elton John, and Barry White, and indicated a promising beginning for Wallace's simple acoustic compositions.Combining something borrowed with something new,  Old Stories  features a handful of traditional songs tucked in between Wallace's original arrangements. Her interpretation of \"The True Lovers Farewell\", a Southern Appalachian folk ballad detailing the distress of a lover separated from the object of her devotion, is sung with a heartwrenching sorrow that is eventually swept away by a cascade of accordions and the mournful sighs of a Busilacchio chord organ. The Celtic love song \"I Live Not Where I Love\" extends Wallace's reflections on distance and broken dreams over the clear pluck of strings, telling the story with her honeyed yet restrained vocal melodies, which naturally lilt with a slight Cockney warble. It's not all trouble and strife for Wallace, however. \"Many Years\" sparkles with the adventurous glow of a new beginning when she sings, \"I'm going where the wind won't find me, I'm going where the seas lie calm.\" And \"The Way You Lie\" is an affectionate ode to a sweetheart that blossoms with the integral modesty that lies at the heart of the whole recording from the careful arrangements to her contemplative lyrical content.This deft mesh of old and new songs flows together so that  Old Stories  manages the impressive feat of sounding simultaneously timeless and modern. Wallace's skilful compositions flourish under her spare treatment, so that when she does choose to embellish particular patches, such as the addition of a violin solo in the middle of the traditional English folk song \"The Drowned Lover\" or the chromatic meandering of a concertina on \"Sleeping Sickness\", the result is suitably effective. It's proof that subtlety can be more dramatic than bravado, and testament to Wallace's knack for applying just the right amount of instrumentation to accompany her vivid tales of lovers walking to work through snowy woods or kicking stones around on a beach.That said, the songs on  Old Stories  have a tendency to sound a bit repetitive, despite being undeniably charming when listened to individually. Wallace's voice never really veers from the path she has set for it, her lyrics are unfailingly grounded in the theme of love and loss, and although instruments fashioned from bellows and buttons match her music well, on a ninetrack album with few other dominant sounds, it can get a little irksome at times. However, these are minor issues compared to Wallace's substantial songwriting talent, which takes British folk traditions and reworks them into something just as authentic and beautiful. "}
