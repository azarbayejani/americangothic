{"label":" Kitsuné","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/15302/homepage_large.4d846c84.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Kitsuné Maison 9","text":" The Kitsuné Maison series is only five years old, but it already seems to be losing its relevance. Where once the sets showed the French label's strong ear for emerging sounds and knack for finding connections between different strands of electronic pop, they now seem to be playing catchup. The best tracks on last year's eighth installment the Drums' \"Let's Go Surfing\", Memory Tapes' \"Bicycle\" had already crossed the threshold of highlevel attention long before getting tracklisted. But at least the inclusion of those tracks felt borne of genuine appreciation. The latest Kitsuné comp, on the other hand, kicks off with Washed Out's High Times highlight \"Belong\", which in this context comes over as a cynical, trendriding move.\"Belong\"'s inclusion seems even more fishoutofwater once you've slogged through the 77minute parade of secondrate bloghouse acts featured here. The worst cuts are almost mesmerizingly awful pastiche, like the bleating emopop of Gamble & Burke's \"Let's Go Together\" or the bizarre astrokraut of Yuksek's \"Supermenz (We're Not)\", which spirals into endless monotony. Worst of all is the Zebra + Snake Remix of the Good Natured's \"Your Body Is a Machine\", which comes off as a poorly thoughtout cross between postLily Allen confessional pop and the xx's clever minimalism.There are some decent tracks. Both Gypsy and the Cat's \"Time to Wander (Joan of Arc Remix)\" and the Twelves' redo of Kitsuné regulars Two Door Cinema Club's \"Something Good Can Work\" could work well mixed into a good DJ set. Elsewhere, Jamaica's \"Short and Entertaining\" snaps like a solid Phoenix Aside, and there are good ideas buried in other tracks that hint at something more. The deeply psychedelic drops of Crookers' collaboration with French pop band Yelle, \"Cooler Couleur\", for instance, go nearly unnoticed due to the overly grating chorus, while Penguin Prison's \"Animal Animal\" would get a thumbsup if it weren't for collegeskaband lyrics like, \"I wish Mike Tyson was my friend/ Then I would tell him everything.\"In a sense, this uneven and fillerstuffed set is an accurate reflection of Internet musical culture. If these 18 selections were spread out over several weeks of postings on a secondrate dance blog, we'd grab the good material and accept the mediocretoawful tracks as part of the deal. Grouped together like this, the set winds up seeming like tastemaking with no sense of taste. "}
