But a little subterfuge can still go a long way. On his hit single, 22yearold singer/rapper Drake insists, \"This one's for you,\" then cops some \"gray sweatpants, no makeup\" sweet talk en route to envisioning himself \"all up in your slot.\" He recently admitted to MTV that \"it's not the most heartfelt song.\" Where Drake talks dirty and sounds AutoTune clean, the Smith Westerns take the opposite approach. Like the Beatles, though, these four Chicago teenagers don't want to hold your hand they want to do more.Don't let the Fab Four mention throw you: From this young Windy City group, retrorock doesn't feel like a history class. Rummaging through 1970s glam, Phil Spector teenpop, and Nuggets garagepunk with the youthful abandon of kids finding new toys in the attic, the Smith Westerns' selftitled debut exudes an earnestness almost as pure as its recording levels are deafening. Their simple, sweet choruses about boys and girls in love could spike the punch at a 1970s TV show (OK, \"Freaks & Geeks\"/\"That '70s Show\") school dance. Parent chaperones would be none the wiser.When singing guitarist Cullen Omori, his bassist brother Cameron, second guitarist Max Kakacek, and a drummer known to Google only as Hal have the tunes to make themselves heard over their vintage aesthetic, The Smith Westerns' teenage kicks are hard to beat. Take stringswept glam ballad \"Be My Girl\", which softly punctuates one of the year's most wrenchingly innocent hooks with somewhat pervier pickup lines. There's less lyrical subtext, but no less raunchy production, on the glamrock boogie of \"Girl in Love\", a comeon cursorily addressing the fleetingness of youth. It's only fitting that in a yearold YouTube video featuring scratchy sockhop swooner \"Tonight\", the Smith Westerns both look and sound like the Black Lips' goodbad notevil twins.These guys are sort of literally true to their school garagerocker Miss Alex White is a fellow Northside College Prep magnetschool alum and their time on the road with the likes of Jay Reatard and Nobunny is evident on fine 60sstyle fratrocker \"Gimme Some Time\". With fuzzedout xylophone, frenetic opener \"Dreams\" suggests the group's most recent tour with Girls and Los Campesinos! might serve them better for a followup. \"Diamond Boys\" almost earns its piano on the strength of its adolescent grandiosity, but \"We Stay Out\" lets lofi become the end rather than the means, with a guitar line that sounds like a bee buzzing underwater.Japandroids, another loud punkish group concerned with youth and girls, ask a cathartic question on PostNothing's \"The Boys Are Leaving Town\". DFA signees Free Energy channel Thin Lizzy's \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" on their recent \"Dream City\" single. The Smith Westerns turn to lighthearted psychfolk for their own declaration: \"Boys Are Fine\". Then, on blithely woooohing fuzzpopper \"The Glam Goddess\", they actually go and say it: \"I wanna hold your hand.\" Boys will be boys. "}
