{"label":" Rough Trade","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15501/homepage_large.bc57eebc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Mystery Jets","title":"Serotonin","text":" Mystery Jets have seemed to always be on the cusp of something it's a story so built for a \"Where Are They Now?\"themed future issue of MOJO. The UK poprockers emerged in 2006 with obscure upbringings (the holyshitisthatarealplace Eel Pie Island), a strange lineup (one of their guitarists, Henry Harrison, is the 60yearold father of lead singer Blaine Harrison), and an exuberant, progleaning debut, Making Dens. 2008's tepid followup, Twenty One, found the Jets with a minor hit on their hands, the polite Cars hat tip \"Two Doors Down\", but the milquetoast, midtempo material it accompanied lacked the inventiveness and general freewheeling fun of their first effort.The expected thing for Mystery Jets to do on their third album and first for Rough Trade, Serotonin, would be to head back to the well and come up with the zonkedout psychpop epic that bands like the Coral wish they dreamed of. Thing is, the band's taken a more surprising route instead, choosing to go 100% allout pop and drafting veteran producer Chris Thomas along for the chartchasing ride. Even weirder: The gamble works. Serotonin is brimming with bedazzled, champagnelight hooks. Almost every cut kicks through the door with an arenaready riff, and the one \"slow\" song of the bunch, the epicsounding mightbealovelettertoacookie \"Lorna Doone\", fittingly brings the record to a close. It's the kind of record the Killers would make, if they were still any good at what they do.Hooks and choruses aren't exactly a new look for the Jets; indeed, the staying power of Making Dens was due to its deft embedding of stickysweet melodies alongside touches of postPink Floyd weirdness. On Serotonin, the influence is more pubready than pillreliant think 1970s glam and early80s MOR. The rocketpower  ed riffs of \"Flash a Hungry Smile\" dissolve into a whistleladen melody; lead single \"Dreaming of Another World\" perpetually builds into the same discoball chorus that comes off as both predictable and pleasantly surprising with every listen. There's a breakdown on album midpoint \"Show Me the Light\" that's so Manfred Mannworthy, you can practically hear the ghosts of rhythmic handclapping.The sole noticeable drawback to Serotonin is the lyrics, which get a little WTFworthy at times (\"So here we are in the dark/ Don't the day feel like a waterpark\"). As a lyricist, Harrison's better when he keeps it simple (see: the variations on the titular theme of \"The Girl Is Gone\", the sappy sentiments of \"Melt\"). When he aims for \"deep,\" as on opener \"Alice Springs\" (\"Freedom is an illusion/ Generated by your brain\") or \"It's Too Late to Talk\" (\"No matter how hard you try/ You couldn't hide from the kick inside\"), the results sound like dormroom talk. Luckily, you don't have to write genius lyrics to make reliable, stadiumready rock. The tics of weirdness that made this band so initially affable may be gone, but they're now a cutrate pop act instead. Nothing wrong with that. "}
