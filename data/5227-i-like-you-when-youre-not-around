{"label":" Kindercore","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/5160/homepage_large.97429b16.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jeremy Schneyer","artist":"The Mendoza Line","title":"I Like You When You're Not Around","text":" The Mendoza Line have been creating utterly lovable back porch style indie rock for a few years, and now have two sublime albums and a lengthy EP, all on Kindercore Records, to their credit. Their latest effort, I Like You When You're Not Around, is chock full of the homey melodies, shuffling beats, wry lyrical twists, and guitars that range from sweetly plucked to fully fuzzed out that made their first two records so appealing. Cosinger/ guitarists Peter Hoffman and Timothy Bracy both sing as if they're half asleep with a mouthful of mashed potatoes (which is a shame when they're singing lines as great as \"Three A.M./ You're crawling 'neath the bar stools/ Tying together some poor fucker's shoes/ Whispering the Catholic girl's blues/ In coffee shops and neon bars/ All the places we played cards/ We are not welcome anymore\" on \"You Twitch When You Dream\"). Many of the songs on When You're Not Around have a small town feel to them most of them are about nothing more profound than hanging out with friends, getting drunk, and complaining about crappy relationships. The songs themselves range from quiet, navel gazing contemplative numbers (\"Social Thursday,\" \"The Kissing Rocks\") to relentless rockers (\"Pushing Buttons,\" \"An Enterprising Molecule\") with pretty much everything you can think of thrown in between, from slightly psychedelic instrumentals to brilliant powerpop. There's even a self proclaimed \"new wave\" tune (\"We'll Never Make the Final Reel\"). But for all its musical variation, pretty much all of the songs on the record carry the same bleary eyed, back porch kinda vibe that lends the album, depending on your point of view, either a numbing, pharmaceutical sameness, or a sleepy, comfortable ambience akin to your favorite flannel shirt. I guess my main complaint with When You're Not Around is that, for some odd reason, they only included lyrics to about half the songs. This means that, aside from the few catchphrases that manage to break through the hung over mumble of the Mendoza Line's vocalists, many of the subtle nuances of the songs are lost because, without a lyric sheet, Bracy and Hoffman's utterances are pretty unintelligible. Let me put it this way: if you like the new Pavement record but just wish that Steve Malkmus would quit enunciating his words so clearly (or if you're just down with that aforementioned utterly lovable back porch style indie rock), you should be handing your $12 over to these guys.
