{"label":" Rhymesayers / Fat Beats","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/339/homepage_large.dbe8bddb.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Sam Chennault","artist":"Atmosphere","title":"God Loves Ugly","text":" Although us critics would lead you to believe that we are all independent, objective thinkers, the truth is that we're often very predictable marketing tools who can be easily manipulated by using a proper set of variables. And God Loves Ugly is chock full of critic yumminess: \"emotionally resonant\" lyrics that \"betray an innervulnerability\"; \"minimalist\" oldschool beats that \"shimmer\" with an \"understated grace\"; the requisite indie record label that is surely a \"breeding ground for unearthed genius\" you get the picture. But a funny thing happened on the way to Atmosphere's coronation; instead of effortlessly wearing the crown of critic's darling, God Loves Ugly is a whiny, heavily affected mess that tries oh so hard, yet ultimately seems as empty and manipulative as the latest Ruff Ryders or Bad Boy album. For those of you unfamiliar with the Atmosphere plotline, Slug (born Sean Daley) is the sort of selfdepreciating, slacker antihero that we've all come to love over the years. Shit, slap a flannel on him, give him a guitar, and he could easily pass for a grunge god (MC Vedder, perhaps?). His resume includes a Midwestern upbringing that left him both disaffected and rootless, a failed romance that he endlessly obsesses over (a la Eminem's \"Kim\"), and a streak of selfdepreciation that both preempts any potential criticism and conveys a veneer of detachment and apathy (a modern hipster must). Together with producer Ant and MC Spawn (who has since departed), Slug released one brilliant but underappreciated gem (1999's Overcast) and a string of widely heralded but rarely purchased EPs that were collected on last year's widely revered Lucy Ford. After constant touring, Atmosphere silently became the 'next big thing' in underground hiphop, a particularly impressive achievement considering the bicoastal regionalism of the genre. Their recent show at San Francisco's Slim's drew one of the largest hiphop crowds the place had ever seen. What's more surprising is that a majority of them were the under21 suburbanite crowd that has made Eminem so popular. So the expectations for God Loves Ugly have been very, very high. And it doesn't always disappoint: \"Blamegame\" boasts some of the dopest dub on the mainland; \"Hair\" is an amusing enough account of an initial foray into groupieland; and Slug injects the album with some great lines. On \"A Song About a Friend\" he raps, \"It'll all be so simple if I were rich, but I'm not/ So I compensate with thought/ I got a lot of nothing that you need to know.\" And the moments of pseudophilosophical, backpackerattracting navelgiving are still there. On \"Loveline\" he ponders: \"A soul is a soul and a shell is a shell/ The border in between is full of everything you felt.../ Everytime I look within I recognize the darkness/ Familiar to the image of the artist.\" Deep, yo. Really, all the elements that made Lucy Ford and Overcast so hot are still present. But whereas those two albums sounded like the intellectually complex basement revelations of an emotionally exhausted yet stubbornly resilient young manoftheworld, God Loves Ugly has a forced and formulaic undercurrent that, despite how hard I tried to look past it, was unmistakable and pervasive. No longer are we hearing the confessions of Sean Daley. Those sweet, innocent days have been replaced by a more violent malaise seemingly calculated to resemble a certain white rap phenomenon who melts in your mouth and not in your hands. Instead of Slug, we have the caricature of Slug: a deeply disaffected young man who, in \"The Bass and the Movement,\" even makes a somewhat tepid attempt to flex, threatening those who don't feel him to \"stuff them full of dick 'till the hole rips.\" Good fucking God! That's almost as nice as Tyson telling a reporter that he was going to \"fuck [him] up the ass 'till [he's] not a faggot anymore.\" Aside from the album's fauxaggression, I can't help feel that Slug has dumbed down some of his sentiments for the sake of accessibility. \"The Modern Man's Hustle\" may be Atmosphere's most popular song to date, but it's also their most easily disposable. Even Ant's beats have lost their charm. Instead of being delicate, lofi constructions, they now sound monolithic, commercial, and just plain boring. \"Flesh\" even resembles a bouncier D12! I really hope that I'm wrong about all of this. I hope that what I'm hearing on this album's just growing pains the transition from the private to the public and the selfconsciousness and uncertainty that goes along with that. I still have much love for Atmosphere and will be quick to pick up their next effort. They have mad talent, no doubt. And although I'm sure that God Loves Ugly will be their bestselling album (maybe even allowing them The Big Crossover), artistically speaking, this is Atmosphere at its damndest. "}
