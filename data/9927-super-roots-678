After years of exploiting rock culture's innate irreverence for tradition, while simultaneously reveling in punk's subdominant trait of restlessness, and yes, boredom, the band got its shit together. From 1995 to 2000, Boredoms shifted their sonic emphasis from zeroattentionspan rock to meditation through repetition. Boredoms' progression is almost perfectly documented on their Super Roots series: Seven EPs reissued by Vice containing the seeds of music found on their more widely available LPs, but more interestingly viewed as pivot points demonstrating how (and when) the band changed directions on their travels upward. I should note, I'm not generally a fan of detailing a band's progression this way. Often, it misleadingly dismisses their early stuff as \"undeveloped,\" or later stuff as somehow \"perfected.\" To the contrary: I think there's something of interest on just about everything Boredoms released, but if the Super Roots records double as decent signposts for the trip, all the better reason to consider them apart from the other albums.Super Roots 6 (1996) sounded like nothing else the band had released to that point or since. Although featuring instrumental contributions from all Boredoms members, the record smacks of Eye; indeed, he's credited with producing and comixing, and though he'd already started his DJ experiments by that time, it's very tempting to view SR6 as the first in a progressively soughtafter line of Eyecentric remixes. The record is by turns atmospheric, murky, propulsive and pretty, though with such evocative titles as \"01\" and \"0(x12)\", you may need to sit down and \"listen in\" rather than expect Boredoms' usual raucous antirock attack. \"6\" is music for swamps, featuring Yamamoto's detuned guitar, and lowpitched toms backed with sounds of water ripples and wind chimes. Its sickly ambience is offset by the psychedelic phasing and jittery funk on \"2\", or its slower, cutup cousin \"9\". In fact, many songs appear to be constructed from bits and pieces of other tracks: \"10\" takes the beat from \"2\", slows it down, and adds an organ intro; \"7\", \"11\" and \"14\" all share the 4x4 tribal techno pound, though they're presented as frantic flail, spaceship drone and minimalist bleeprock respectively. \"15\" is a somber, contemplative organ postlude to a record that defies expectations; SR6 contains arguably Boredoms' most underrated music. Enter Boredoms v3.0. After years of taking nowave to strange heights, and hinting at a change to come on their mid90s records, the band launched fullfledged rocketship rock on 1998's Super Roots 7. Arriving soon after their American breakthrough Super æ, SR7 witnessed the band not only embracing the rhythmfirst upward thrust of Can and Neu!, but also of constructing \"songs\" as massive, 20minute vehicles for trance and primal transcendentalism. And they did this by covering the Mekons. Boredoms transform the beloved English punk band's \"Where Were You?\" into a work of magnificent, sparkling abandon, entitled \"7\" (not to be confused with \"7\" from SR6). The EP contains three tracks, though the centerpiece is \"7→ (Boriginal)\"; it begins with the sounds of crickets and Eye's whispering, \"super roots... seven\" before the engines start and a synth tone shoots up over capitalM Motorik. Soon, the guitars enter with the Mekons riff, and the track already fits in perfectly with anything on Super æ or Vision Creation Newsun it's just getting started. Minutes later, it moves into pristine psychedelic dance rock, gradually increasing in intensity for a few minutes before the floodgates open just past the 13minute mark. And that's it: The promise of SR3's hardcore trance, the suggestion that noise can be heavenly on SR5 all of it crashes down at this moment in the song, and had the band never recorded another note, they could still be said to have perfected... whatever one calls this kind of music. The song splashes down with a mellow coda, sounding not unlike much of SR6, and though the EP ends with a curiously anticlimactic Eye remix of the tune, the thrill of the \"Boriginal\" resonates long after the music stops.Super Roots 8 (1999) was released just before VCN and sounds perfectly at home in the latter day Boredoms canon. Like SR7, it consists of three tracks, the main of which is a cover. This time around, the song is \"Jungle Taitei\", originally the theme of a popular anime series of the same name (translated as \"Jungle Emperor\"), composed by Isao Tomita. However, the vibe here is pure Boredoms: hispeed techno exotica, congas, phased guitar harmonies, and a great, wordless vocal by Yoshimi (occasionally doubled by Eye). The song is perhaps the closest Boredoms ever came to releasing a straight \"pop\" song, though no track with Eye's signature cramming of as much percussion as inhumanly possible into his mixes is ever going to storm the top 40. His \"DJ Let's TRY & D.I.Y. (Drum Machine Mix)\" is sparser, perhaps foretelling the kind of noises he'd make on the 2002 \"Endless Happiness\" remix for Black Dice, while Yann Tomita's mix slows the beat down by half, and turns everything lush and even more overtly psychedelic. Fans of this era of Boredoms will certainly want SR8, though it's less essential than the records Boredoms made immediately before or after. Vision Creation Newsun came out in Japan during summer 1999 as part of a limited edition (and still very collectible) box, and appeared as a single CD in 2000. Soon afterwards, as the story goes, Boredoms disappeared. Today, we have V∞rdoms, and though they radiate with a warm all their own, I'd be lying if I didn't admit to missing Boredoms. Of course, we still have the records, and their best moments haven't lost much in the decade since they were released. I almost envy those of you still unaware of all this boremight: it was a long, strange trip to the sun.  "}
