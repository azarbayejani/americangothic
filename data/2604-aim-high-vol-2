{"label":" Aim High","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/2581/homepage_large.8df199e3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jess Harvell","artist":"DJ Target / Riko","title":"Aim High, Vol. 2","text":" Whether jungle (Reinforced, Moving Shadow, Suburban Base) or UK garage (Locked On, Public Demand, Tempa), in the world of faceless London beat music, labels were always the best way to gauge whether a record was going to be epochal or just DJ fodder for the week. But with grime shifting the focus to the MC and the outsized personality, it's been far easier to pick and choose by who's got the best voice, the best bars, the most magnetic mic presence. (If I had space, I could also get into murky sociological discussion about the negative influence of America and abandoning a highly developed DIY economy for scraps from the major label table.) But with Terror Danjah's Aftershock, Davinchie's Paperchase, and, the one we've gathered here today to talk about, DJ Target's Aim High, grime is finally starting to develop a community of record labels that rank with UK postrave's best. As a producer, Target is one of grime's top boys, and I talk about him more in depth here. The first Aim High mixtape relied too heavily on nicked US rap beats buffeted by a handful of amazing grime riddims. This one is all East London and all gravy. Riko's \"Critical\" sets the stakes for everyone involved (\"I ain't even got half a grand/ I'm bang on the penny\") and I bet you relate. Dogzilla's \"Never Ending Story\" conflates the cinematic reject from a cutrate Henson creature shop with his own days on the grind. Target's hypnotic revamp of Sadie & Kano's \"So Sure\" spreads the creamy vocals and heartswell synth pulses over a grunting, pixilated bassline and ratattat drums. Roll Deep continue their inexplicable slide into mawkishness with Wiley's \"Be Yourself\" all cloying softsoul piano trills and unctuous male R&B; chorus. So be careful you don't snap your neck with Crazy Titch's freestyle, a crazed Balkan barrage of corkscrewing fiddle, concrete block beats, and edgeofhysteria vocals. Riko's \"Don't Want You Back\" serves an ungrateful lover their walking papers over a tablamatic riddim with flickers of 80s metal guitar snaking through. Then Roll Deep earns back a smidgen of my grudging affection with the serpentine, buzzing \"Don't Choke\". (Later, they get keys to my apartment and my ATM pin number with the aptly titled \"Hardcore\".) Riko and Godsgift's \"Dead That\" is a classic Wileysounding cellobass gunman tune with particularly aggro warlord MC'ing. Breeze's \"Marching On\" sounds like a quiet storm slowjam subjected to the Todd Edwards treament, liquefied and poured over some sizzling cymbals. Breeze's \"Be Like This\" may be the funkiest grime tune yet, swinging along to a gabba terror synth snipped into a bassline. Except it may be pipped by Dream's \"Get It Done\" which, gulp, reminds me of Kanye's production for Mark Spitz's \"One More For Me\". On \"Cuz Freestyle\", Flowdan calls himself \"the human iPod\" (is that sillier than Bruza claiming he's \"running past you in the game like Sonic the Hedgehog\"?) over stalker strings. If the above made you a little dizzy, wait till you hear it: Twentyfive songs crashing into each other, crushing for space, vying for your attention. Unlike jungle or UKG, with their built in stutters and beat barbs, there's little in the way of a comforting pulse to latch onto in grime. The effect is more like dancehall (little actual mixing, just slapping intensities down next to each other) or rap mixtapes (content overload.) Grime can actually be a little wearying at more than fortyfive minutes a pop. But this needs to be heard for anyone interested in current beatmaking stateoftheart. "}
