{"label":" Frenetic","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/1780/homepage_large.9214f3a3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Adam Moerder","artist":"The Curtains","title":"Vehicles of Travel","text":" Side projects often sound like diluted versions of the original. So when branching from Deerhoof, whose music's predicated on spontaneity, brevity, and \"elements\" of songs rather than complete compositions, how stripped down could a side project get? Try 23 songs in less than 35 minutes, the duration of the Curtains' third LP, Vehicles of Travel. In that time, the band which features Deerhoof's Chris Cohen and Greg Saunier along with Open City drummer Andrew Maxwell manages to cram a bevy of melodies, drum beats, and sound effects into the album, sacrificing form and repetition for musical exploration. For obvious reasons, the songs seldom qualify as \"memorable,\" excepting a few where Maxwell loans his vocals. The entire album feels like the gradual metamorphosis of one giant song rather than a collage of one to two minute tracks. A cherubic mood permeates throughout, as though the band unassembled a child's music box to piece it back together with guitars and synthesizers. \"April Galleons\" and \"Fletcher's Favorite\" come the closest to clean, reconstructed products, drawing inspiration from \"The Rainbow Connection\" and \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\". However, bizarre lyrics deny the album a total PBS feel, like on \"Personal Resources\": \"On top of the Seneca/ The mayor's wife told the senator/ The Fuhrer and me met secretly, yesterday.\" Despite these eccentricities, there's a nostalgic quality to the songs, although for what time remains unclear. Although the majority of the album harkens back to 60s television themes, bits of 70s kraut and 80s pop intermittently emerge as well. \"Pagoda Defenders\" and \"Nite Crew\" resemble synthrockers like Falco and Duran Duran while \"The Gadabouts\" and \"The Bronx Zoobreak\" employ unconventional percussion and horn arrangements reminiscent of Neu! or Can. For what it's worth, the \"idea\" density on this record is very high. Unfortunately, the songwriting lacks the spunk and creativity necessary to trick listeners into believing these 90second snippets are fully completed songs a skill Deerhoof has perfected. Hard as you may try, it's nearly impossible to perceive the Curtains as something more than a sole, albeit critical, cog removed from a larger, betteroiled machine. "}
