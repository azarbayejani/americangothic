Deusner","artist":"Drive-By Truckers","title":"The Fine Print (A Collection Of Oddities and Rarities 2003-2008)","text":" In March 1999, George Jones slammed his SUV into a bridge abutment, and DriveBy Truckers got a song out of it. Jones wasn't reeling from alcohol, nor was he being chased by an angry ex, nor did any of the hardliving country tropes play into the crash. Instead, he was simply talking on his cell phone to his daughter. He was in critical condition but recovered eventually. Which is fortunate, because a legend like Jones shouldn't go out that way. Part joking and part shaming, the Truckers' \"George Jones Talkin' Cell Phone Blues\" acts as a biopic of sorts, framing a consideration of his life and legacy with details from the crash. \"He almost stopped loving her today,\" Hood sings, before admonishing the legend: \"Better leave that cell phone alone.\"That song kicks off The Fine Print, a collection of \"oddities and rarities\" that closes out a particularly productive decade for DriveBy Truckers. They were bound to get around to this kind of release sooner or later: At any given time they've had three and sometimes four songwriters in the band at once, so the backlog of unused songs was sure to back up the drains and overflow into a catchall like this one. As a retrospective, The Fine Print is incomplete, covering only 2003 onward (save a recent version of a Pizza Deliverance song). There's no Rob Malone, who left the band following Southern Rock Opera; Shonna Tucker sings only a verse of their redundant cover of \"Like a Rolling Stone\"; but there are two new Jason Isbell tracks, which reminds you how naturally he fit into the group and how dynamically the band performed his songs. \"When the Well Runs Dry\" is a tense assessment of romantic and creative desiccation, and you can almost hear the mosquitoes buzzing around the languid \"TVA\", a shaggy dog story told by a backwoods lifer and interrupted by a simple, graceful guitar solo.The Truckers don't skimp on the elements that have made them stand out among the southernrock upstarts: These songs are populated with realistic characters in hardluck situations, soundtracked with gnarly guitars and gritty vocals. \"The Great Car Dealer War\" and this version of \"Goode's Field Road\" (from Brighter Than Creation's Dark) are two more entries into Hood's Southern crime syndicate series. Recorded for The Dirty South, \"The Great Car Dealer War\" is told from the point of view of an arsonist who burns down car lots, and Hood balances the gravity of his testimony with bits of grim humor. Mike Cooley's \"Uncle Frank\" may not have quite as strong an impact, but this alternate version of an early song does include a grim coda not included in the original, which gives the song even higher stakes.Their take on Tom Petty's \"Rebels\", recorded for \"King of the Hill\", fits so perfectly among the Truckers' original that I forgot it was a cover, and Hood updates Tom T. Hall's Vietnamera \"Mama Bake a Pie (Daddy Kill a Chicken)\" to Iraq, fitting it nicely among the veteran songs on Brighter Than Creation's Dark. But the real story here is their version of \"Play It All Night Long\", which Warren Zevon wrote as a response to Lynyrd Skynyrd's response to Neil Young's \"Southern Man\". The Truckers wrote about Skynyrd and Young on 2001's Southern Rock Opera, so this cover acts as a sort of epilogue to that album. Plus, they fold in a few bars from \"Ain't That Pretty at All\" before throwing the song against a wall and beating it senseless with their guitars.Unsurprisingly, the rarities on The Fine Print could make a good album, but the oddities are often distracting. Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\", which they covered for Uncut magazine, is pretty much uncoverable, but the Truckers do as good a job as anyone else. The noir blues \"Mrs. Claus' Kimono\" is about unrest among the elves and reindeer, who plot to off Santa. Hood's conspiratorial tone sounds as out of place here as the song's cartoonish concept, but at least they can poke a little fun at themselves. More crucially, it adds another facet to The Fine Print, which recalls the Truckers' studio albums in its range of distinct tones and subjects: Filled with ups and downs, this collection of tossoffs and alsorans portrays the Truckers as a band that finds inspiration in the unlikeliest places.
