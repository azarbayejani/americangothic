I'd rather not get neurotic about genre especially in the obsessively territorial underbrush of dance music so I'll say that Mount Kimbie is a London duo that makes pretty, mostly midtempo tracks between three and four minutes long with spedup vocal samples, little tunnels of ambience, unimposing synth patches, and syncopated percussion that sounds like someone putting away the silverware (or that waterdroplet effect people make by flicking their cheek with their finger). Small music, scarf music.Maybes and Sketch on Glass aren't always sunny, but they're playful, dreamy, and melancholic refreshing qualities to hear in dubstep, a genre slightly less emotionally versatile than hair metal. Even Burial its most expressive, articulate producer works in a kind of greyscale compared to Mount Kimbie (though, to be fair, Burial's music reaches a depth that Mount Kimbie's doesn't, and probably isn't aiming for).It's true that their rhythms are still dubstep in DNA deftly syncopated, slightly offcenter, ambiguously danceable but most of what they lay on top of the beat sounds like it's being dragged out from places dubstep usually doesn't go: R&B, postrock, IDM. Of the two EPs,Â Sketch on Glass is markedly funkier but also feels more selfassured and detailed: The bass is deeper but the sound is lighter and more agile; the plinks and pops sorta cute really ricochet around in the mix instead of just accenting it; the vocal samples are warped and flattened in weirder ways.Still, Maybes especially the title track is a good listen, and should be of interest to listeners who find dubstep's pervasive moodiness to be a turnoff (in his yearend column for this site, Martin Clark mentioned the group in a paragraph about records that went \"beyond the dubstep sphere\"). Between both EPs, there's character, humor, light chaos, nice sound design, and real melodic imperative. It's strong music, and I want to hear more. Big ups, as they say in England. Oh, and some people are just calling this stuff \"step.\" "}
