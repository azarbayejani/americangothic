{"label":" Nettwerk","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/4100/homepage_large.3bffd86c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stephen M. Deusner","artist":"Ivy","title":"In the Clear","text":" Perhaps because singer Dominique Durrand sounds so continental, Ivy were often associated with the Frenchpop minitrend of the late 1990s, which coincided with their most popular album, Apartment Life. Never mind that the band had by then been around for years and that twothirds of it Adam Schlesinger and Durrand's husband, Andy Chase were not only American but did double duty in Long Island\\xD0based Fountains of Wayne. Since then, Ivy took steps away from their Francophilia on 2001's overlooked Long Distance and the 2002 covers album Guest Room, Schlesinger wooed Stacy's mom 247 on MTV, and Durrand released an EP and an album with side project Paco. On In the Clear, their fifth fulllength, Ivy sounds less like a 90s throwback than a lateeighties throwback. Their brand of jetset pop has grown so aerodynamic and mature, so sophisticated and airtight, that they're beginning to sound like Danny Wilson, Johnny Hates Jazz, or Breathe. That comparison may read like a harsh criticism, but this trajectory doesn't necessarily lead downward. Much of In the Clear sounds slick and overrehearsed, but songs like \"Thinking About You\" and \"Tess Don't Tell\" recapture the winsome mood of the band's best work. On the opener, \"Nothing But the Sky\", a lowkey wash of reverby keyboards and starryeyed guitars keeps Durrand's voice aloft as she drifts \"15 miles high.\" On \"Four in the Morning\", a low bass line intermingles with an acoustic guitar to create a lonely a.m. ambience, and a backmasked guitar adds an eddying solo to \"Ocean City Girl\". But most songs on In the Clear focus on delivering bittersweet hooks instead of evocative atmosphere. \"Corners of Your Mind\" has a mod energy in its chorus, and Brazilian composer ZÃ© Luis's subtle string arrangement adds snap to \"Thinking About You\". As the chiaroscuro cover image implies, the album is about movement and travel, a theme that aligns with the band's strengths. Like Nina Persson and Francoise Hardy, Durrand benefits from the sleepy detachment in her voice; on these 10 songs that quality makes her sound resigned yet wideeyed and even hopeful. Here, constant motion is not a luxury but an emotional necessity: \"In a world without you,\" Durrand sings, \"all I can do is keep moving.\" As produced by Chase and Schlesinger and mixed by Steve Osbourne, the album tries to conjure the anchorlessness of travel, but instead it sounds oddly weightless, floating by pleasantly but unobtrusively and rarely demanding your attention, as if the music is dissolving into the ether as it leaves your speakers. In the Clear ultimately proves too airy, too ephemeral: each song exists only when it's playing, washing over you but rarely lingering once it ends. "}
