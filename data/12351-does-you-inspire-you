Imagine: an impossibly cute and dyingtoplease young girl sets a camera on a tripod in her backyard and does a series of wellintentioned, but ultimately failed tumbling moves to prove her adoration of a significant other. It's almost enough to trump the fact that Apple recently licensed the song for an ad and made their own associations with it, namely a line of Nanos bleeding brightly colored paint. Not quite as cute, but if we use former Pitchfork contributor Nick Sylvester's metric for Apple's aims with ad music that it should sound close enough to a familiar iconic song but come at a much cheaper price \"Bruises\" works perfectly. At a time when most of us can still summon \"Young Folks\" and (the famously iPodded) \"1234\" from memory, and \"Bruises\" a whiff of soul, but a stronger aroma of feminine allure mixed with littlegirl na√Øvete is a more than obvious choice.Inspire can't match the precious glee of \"Bruises\" over its uneven length, but the trio tries from different angles, toying with several other ideas. They live in Brooklyn and are touring with Yeasayer, so if you guessed \"thick, vaguely FarEastern new age haze\" is one of their schticks, you're not too far off. It's put to best use on albumopening \"Garbage\", which sounds like nothing else right now, musically or ideologically. Over an oddly retrofuturistic palette, something like the synthjazz theme song to a kitschy 1970s detective drama, Caroline Polachek laments the everincreasing mountains of postconsumer detritus (VCRs, condoms and the like) like she feverishly wrote the lyrics on the way home from WALLE.Depending on your vantage, the differently alluring \"Planet Health\" could be drawn from two different worlds: The exotic scifi realm the title suggests, or the forgotten domain of proudly Orientalist synthpop group Japan, on whose 1981 album Tin Drum its slapbass, gong, and what sounds like a highpitched koto would fit nicely. Polachek proves on \"Garbage\" a highconcept bit of musical ecosympathy that lyrical subtlety isn't always her first priority, but the \"Planet Health\" line \"I was trained in diversity, in the garden of puberty\" drops a \"Space Olympics\"level of awkwardness into a song that otherwise was losing me in its atmosphere. The title should give enough indication about this particular planet's topography, but to be specific, there exists a \"food pyramid\" and a \"desert of vitamins\" in this faroff world.Other than the Human Leaguesuggesting \"Evident Utensil\" (that utensil, coincidentally enough for rhyming purposes, is a pencil), the rest of Inspire feels distant and thin, with minor songs buried beneath a veil of mystique. Most often, that aura switches from the final frontier, to, well, the frontier. \"Somewhere Around Here\" is ersatz Cowboy Junkies, and \"Earwig Town\" and \"Don't Give a Damn\" nod toward Southwestern twang and straightup country, but not convincingly. And that's understandable, of course: Chairlift are young and curious, still testing sounds on the way to a unique aesthetic, which parts of Inspire shows they are capable of achieving. While \"Bruises\" proves that a welldone song that sounds like other songs can make people take brief notice, Inspire mostly proves that recycling isn't the only answer. "}
