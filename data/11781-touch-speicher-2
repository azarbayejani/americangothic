{"label":" Kompakt","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13233/homepage_large.991544a8.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Mark Pytlik","artist":"Michael Mayer","title":"Touch","text":" Michael Mayer's gift for the definitive statement has made him a worthy figurehead for microhouse. Sure, it helps that he owns Kompakt Records, but his expertly constructed mixes are so authoritative and lean that they read like bluesky distillations of a point in time; he's one of few DJs who can communicate the fullbodied landscape of a scene and meditate on its past and future possibilities in the span of 70 minutes.But despite being responsible for two such landmark mixes in 2002's Immer and 2003's Fabric 13, Mayer's original material has heretofore been consigned to 12inches. Lost amidst the glut of preholiday releases last December, Touch is the fulllength debut he has reportedly labored over for years. Dissatified with the album's many previous incarnations, Mayer recorded this final version over a threeweek burst last summer; with its light, August atmospheres and simple, elementary sounds, Touch communicates the natural environment in which it was made. It also sounds like it was hatched in a relatively short timeframe, which is no bad thing where Mayer's studio mixes have been assembled with a painstakingly precise, scissorcut aesthetic, Touch generally feels rounder, more casual and certainly more homemade.Of the eight tracks, only one the wispy \"Lovefood\" contains vocals. The rest range from the bythebooks techno of atmospheresetting opener \"Touch\" to the proggy (translation: epic and undanceable) no man's land of the album centrepiece \"Slowfood\". But, a few highlights notwithstanding (both \"Heiden\" and the previously released \"Amabile\" ooze slowcooked energy), Touch never achieves liftoff, nor does it ever really threaten to. Instead, it just kind of blissfully floats around in its own selfcontained environment, content to prettily fizzle out into an unceremonious anticlimax.Mixed a few months prior, Speicher 2 comprises tracks mostly culled from Kompakt Extra's Speicher series, and shows Mayer the clinician at his best. With a small pool of strong source material to select from, Mayer's job is admittedly a lot easier here. As ever, he reveals himself to be a master of momentum, easing into the mix with dark rumblers like Wighnomy Brothers' \"Wurz + Blosse\", Wolfgang Voigt's \"Nachschub\", and the bubbling techno of his own brilliant \"X\". Thirty minutes down the line, he's dutifully moved on to bangers like Freiland's prickly \"Jens Harke Mix\", the schaffel stomp of Fuschsbau's \"Null/Eins\", and Naum's spangly \"Ari\" the final track in another functionally and technically sound set.Like Touch, at times Speicher 2 suffers underneath the weight of Mayer's past achievements or maybe that's just microhouse beginning to show diminishing returns. But even if neither of these records ultimately match up to Kompakt's finest, they're still welcome outings, and proof that Mayer is the rare leader from whom \"more of the same\" is still a welcome proposition.
