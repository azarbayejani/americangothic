One is radio exposure. There've been major and minor U.S. dancehall hits since forever, from Shabba to Shaggy to Beanie. But the last few years have been a golden age for dancehall on the radio, as both \"Diwali\" and \"Coolie Dance\" ignited riddim mania for the first time in the U.S. The other is CD compilations, especially Greensleeves' Biggest Dancehall Anthems and Ragga Ragga Ragga series. The 2003 editions of both are among the best records released in the new millennium, accurately reflecting what a great year it was for dancehall. But, for me, 2004's editions failed to catch fire. Was something rotten in the state of dancehall? Well, yes and no. Both CDs lacked the same number of exciting riddims as their 2003 counterparts. But, if you managed to dig through even a bit of the yearly mudslide of JAonly singles and oneriddim albums, you'd find beats (\"Bubble Up\", \"Dancehall Rock\") that slew the immediately canonized ones. So, yes, it's foolish to attribute a creative slump to the licensing capabilities of a single label. But since most of you are A) American, B) not hardcore dancehall fans, and C) employed at least parttime, compilations it is. And to judge by 2005's RX3, the dilettantes are facing an even sketchier crop. Most of my annoyance with current dancehall stems from the continued influence of soca. Soca, for those who don't know, is the preferred Carnival soundtrack for many Caribbean nations. To the naked, untrained ear, soca seems close to dancehall, the way your grandma would hear no difference between Aesop Rock and Paul Wall. But soca is, if nothing else, faster than dancehall. Fast enough to make the LCD examples of it sound like crankedup cruise ship commercials. Soca does have its more \"innovative\" aspects like a submerged bhangra influence that's surely had a little to do with dancehall's own far east fetishism. But, as artists like TOK began to mix up soca with their hardcore boy band ragga, they set in motion dancehall's current fascination with hypahypa 120bpm dance craze tunes. Call me a funhating old crank, but a lot of this stuff is really goddamn annoying. Worst offender here is Macka Diamond's \"Lexus & Benz\". Not only does it feature the de rigeur spastic oompah oompah beat, but includes...wait for it...a banjo. Really fast \"HeeHaw\" banjo. I'm sorry but this is whimsy gone too far. Other subpar tracks include Voicemail (wtf), Delly Ranks, and Bogle's \"Weh Di Time\", another \"do the yardie Mashed Potato\" tune. (I should take a second here to say RIP to Bogle, who was like Bez crossed with MJ in his prime and something like a national deity. His death is the only reason I feel iffy dissing all the dance craziness here.) Macka Diamond's \"Mr. Teki Back\" has an annoying brappbrapp military beat. (As does Sizzla's \"I'm With the Girls\".) Then that fucking banjo shows up again on Beenie's \"Dance To the Chakka\". Could we have more Junior Byles and less Junior Samples, please? But, as per Jamaica's per annual output, there are gems here. Beenie's \"Ziggy Zung\" is a socastyled track that works, mostly due to the inclusion of the line \"Peter Peter pum pum eater.\" Vybz Kartel's \"Dutty Panty\" is a nicely clonking old school groove with a bizarre injunction against sheer undies. On the other side of sanity, Vybz's \"Spragga Connection\" is a virulent diss track originally titled, uh, \"Faggot Correction\". You can hear the knot of tension forming in his neck as he (literally) spits the foul line about Foxy Brown pissing in Spragga's face. Mad Cobra's \"Switch\" answers my thwarted request post\"Allo Allo\" for a dancehall track with an accordion, plus a clanging submarine alarm which I didn't ask for, but what they hey. Beenie Man's \"Three Laws\" is bleep and bass played at 140bpm, and with another argument against an oral sex contract in the mutual interest. (Really fellas, it ain't gonna bite you.) Vybz's \"School Bus\" has a vaguely eastern synth drone and avalanche drums with Vybz sagely advising the youth not to have sex on the bus but to instead study chemistry and ProTools. And who says ragga's all amoral gunplay and fassy bashing? "}
