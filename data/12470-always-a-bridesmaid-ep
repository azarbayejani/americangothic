{"label":" Capitol","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/12982/homepage_large.4a02731d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Love","artist":"The Decemberists","title":"Always a Bridesmaid EP","text":" As Decemberists frontman Colin Meloy recently intimated to Rolling Stone, the band's forthcoming LP, Hazards of Love, is for all intents and purposes a rock opera, encompassing a narrative suite that tells the tale of \"a woman named Margaret who is ravaged by a shapeshifting animal.\" Considering the anthropomorphic bent of the group's last fulllength, The Crane Wife, it would seem Meloy has swapped maritime yarns for tragic critter fables as his prevailing field of interest, but that's a minor point.More interestingly, and perhaps worryingly, is the \"rock opera\" part. Sure, it might be pulled off flawlessly, though something about the RS article's promise of \"crushing stonermetal lurches\" leaves me a bit concerned. The Decemberists have always embraced their own inescapable pretentiousness, yet their saving grace was the selfaware lightness with which they carried their geekdom, at its best manifested in breezy dorkouts like \"Billy Liar\" and \"The Sporting Life\". By comparison, chunks of The Crane Wife felt turgid and overblown, indications that a band once wise enough to cordon off its most epic tendencies in ancillary standalones like The Tain EP had allowed the weight of ambition to partially sink its albums.This year, the Decemberists released a series of three vinyl singles, joined under the shared title Always the Bridesmaid, that after the sometimes unwieldy The Crane Wife offer a welcome return to more modest song forms. The first and most lyrically eargrabbing of these six tunes is \"Valerie Plame\", a beseeching love letter to the infamously outed CIA operative narrated by an imagined confidant. Meloy's treatment of the Plame affair may seem a tad flippant considering the grave journoethical issues that go unmentioned and, shame about the unnecessary \"Hey Jude\"ish outro yet he nails perfectly the milieu of 21st century foreign intrigue, right down to references to Vespas and \"the Green Zone Marriott.\"Less thematically loaded but more compositionally satisfying is \"Days of Elaine\", which substitutes modern headline fodder for imagery of macabre decay that's more typical of Meloy's bent, touching obliquely on drink, drugs, and execution. Most importantly, the song is a rousing triumph of momentum, replete with a tight riff and providing an excellent conduit for its singer's reedy tones. That sense of putting melody and verbiage on equal footing carries over to the second Aside, the wistful \"O New England\".A headscratching cover of the Velvet Underground's \"I'm Sticking With You\" follows (why aim for charming artlessness when you're already interpreting one of rock's most famously unaffected moments?), but the series finishes strong with the 12 punch of \"Record Year\" and \"Raincoat Song\". The former performs the classic Meloy trick of conflating societal and romantic ruin, while the abrupt but evocative latter gives us a brief character sketch of a luckless spinster and delivers the best lyric of the whole collection, as Meloy wryly but heartrendingly opines that \"the raincoat you wore when it rained today/ I think it only made it rain more.\" It's precisely such a moment of fine observation and quiet humanity that hopefully won't be lost if the Decemberists continue to make albums overweening with conceptual heft.
