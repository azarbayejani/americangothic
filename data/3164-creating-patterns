However, the topical concerns of Creating Patterns bring to mind an incredible array of ism's eastern mysticism, religious syncretism and socially progressive, getyerassoffthecouch pragmatism, to name a few that come close to derailing the musical content. With nearly 30 years separating us from Songs in the Key of Life, the conceits contained there simply sound na√Øve; here, they border more on the selfindulgent. My interest in Creating Patterns was largely piqued by the UK hype surrounding its release and its designation in more than one place as albumoftheyear. I was prepared to follow suit 30 seconds into the first track, \"Conceptions,\" when I was taken aback by the gorgeous mix of layered strings, sitar, and soprano sax over a loping bassline that wafted from the speakers like a shower of perfumed lotus petals. I eased back in my chair and let myself float away, prepared never to come back, except possibly as a Bodhisattva gushing praise for my new favorite album. But what followed was a letdown. Aside from \"Conceptions,\" there's really only one other track on the album that took me hook, line and sinker: \"Les Fleur.\" And even this song lost most of its luster when it revealed itself as a nearly notefornote replica of Minnie Riperton's gorgeous song of the same name. My experience with Creating Patterns was consistently disrupted by lyrical contributions I found hard to swallow. \"Time\" features the ubiquitous Ursula Rucker spoiling a perfectly good arrangement with her openmicnight voyage of spiritual conflict, which is only enlightening insofar as it displays how much more convenient it is for a poet to ransack the Old Testament than to try to say something original. Mark Murphy's performance on \"Twelve Tribes\" is far more convincing and I loved his delivery. But it also includes lines like, \"Twelve, the infinite number/ All of us are twelve once and then never the same/ Twelve opens the eyes and the mind/ We learn more between the ages of twelve and eighteen than we ever again experience in learning/ The Mayan calendar ends in 2012/ What, then?/ Hmm? Hmm?\" I assume we're supposed to find this incredibly mindblowing. Maybe after smoking a few bowls. (\"2012! Dude, what a bummer! We'd better have this all smoked by then we don't want it to go to waste.\") If you can ignore the silliness, though, it's a great track that rivals Medeski, Martin and Wood's \"Whatever Happened to Gus?\" \"Another Day\" features Jill Scott, and it's kind of odd hearing a woman that sounds like Anita Baker sing about how, although she'd rather stay home and play video games than go to work, by god, she's going to push forward and make something of herself. \"Unique\" turns things around with Braziliantinged instrumentation and Portuguese vocals, and \"The Day of the Greys,\" an epic, folkinflected number, keeps the record riding at a passable level. \"Hold It Down\" might even appeal to fans of Lauryn Hill and straight ahead R&B.; But then there are the numerous unpleasant excursions into jazz fusion like \"Twothesme,\" \"Golden Solitude,\" and \"Eight,\" which grind away repetitively to the point of a mindnumbing, nextsongplease anxiety.Creating Patterns left me disappointed, and feeling that the album could have amounted to much more. A shame, because 4 Hero are creating some of the most startling studio sounds I've come across. The string arrangements that back the tracks here remind me of the golden age of 70s soul, smooth and wellcrafted. The beats are crisp and catchy, and the scope of the album is ambitious, even though, in the end, that ambition proves to be its biggest weakness. I'll be looking forward to their next effort, hoping they decide to trust their own talents and go it alone. "}
