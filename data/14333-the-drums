{"label":" Island / Moshi Moshi","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15386/homepage_large.a7d20bfc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stuart Berman","artist":"The Drums","title":"The Drums","text":" As the Drums' recent appearance on Friday Night With Jonathan Ross suggests, frontman Jonathan Pierce is not a man who is concerned with looking cool. Bearing a passing resemblance to Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid nemesis William Zabka, Pierce prances and preens through a performance of recent single \"Best Friend\" in a series of stilted robot dance moves, sweeping gameshowhost hand gestures, and bugeyed facial expressions, while delivering the arch, Morrisseyworthy lyrics (\"You were my best friend/ But then you died\") in a hammy, loungesinger baritone. But then, given Pierce's track record, it's not surprising he has a healthy appreciation for the absurd; this is a man, after all, who called his old band Goat Explosion.In 2005, Goat Explosion also featuring future Drums cofounder Jacob Graham changed its name to the somewhat less ridiculous Elkland and were snapped up by Columbia Records during the postFranz Ferdinand/Killers majorlabel rush to sign any new waveinspired band with swoopingfringe haircuts. However, the failure of Elkland's glossy, stadiumsized synthpop to connect with the masses would seemingly account for the Drums' more modest, minimalist reinterpretation and reinvigoration of the same 80s mopepop inspirations (New Order, the Cure, the Smiths, Orange Juice), one that's more likely to ingratiate itself to fans of the Labrador and Sincerely Yours rosters than KROQ programmers.It says a lot about the Drums' confidence that they've left two of their best (and bestloved) early songs, \"I Felt Stupid\" and \"Submarine\", off of their fulllength debut and they're not entirely missed either. (The band did retain its biggest blog hit \"Let's Go Surfing\", a cheeky retort to the recent blissedout, beachcrazy strain in indie pop.) However, other songs that try to build upon the \"Stupid\" template accelerated clicktrack drum beats, onestring Barney Sumner guitar riffs, and woeisme verses that lead to cloudparting choruses don't always improve on it, with the cutting observations of \"Me and the Moon\" (\"you still sleep with your back to me\") overshadowed by the annoying shout of \"eeyoh!\" that punctuates each chorus run. And there are times when Pierce's outsized persona meshes awkwardly with his band's understated approach, like when he uses the stark arrangement of 50sthrowback ballad \"Down By the Water\" as an excuse to test out his backofthearena wail.More so than their wellcurated influences, it's this tension between the band's populist and insular tendencies that most defines the Drums at this point in their career. Conventional wisdom dictates that the Drums will simply follow the New Order evolutionary path toward writing bigtent festival anthems (a future prophesied by the anthemic, widescreen synthpop of \"Forever and Ever Amen\"). But there is just as much evidence to suggest particularly in the album's less exuberant but more revelatory second half that the band this band truly excels in more intimate spaces, like the affectingly desolate motorik pop of \"I Need Fun in My Life\" and the wonderful \"I'll Never Drop My Sword\", a winsome, jangly ode to perseverance featuring an appealingly effete vocal that Pierce should adopt more often. No surprise then that the suggestively titled closer \"The Future\" provides little indication of what it holds for the Drums: Pierce's chesty bellow sees him prepping himself for a lifetime of cameramugging latenight talkshow appearances, but the symphony of glockenspiels ringing throughout the song projects an air of snowglobe serenity, and of a band that's eager to insulate itself from external hype and pressures.Like the Strokes, another fastrising band of prettyboy New Yorkers, the Drums have successfully answered the challenge of parlaying buzzgenerating singles into an album that's well stocked with instantly appealing pop songs. Unlike the Strokes, however, the Drums lack a certain element of surprise they so faithfully adhere to 80s postpunk and new pop influences even after a decade where those sources have been thoroughly milked. But then that could ultimately be to the Drums' benefit in that they're so behind the curve, they're practically ahead of a new one. "}
