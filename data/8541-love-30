As a matter of fact, if I were in a band, and the release for the new joint said something like, \"Gee, you know, these guys, I'd love to say they're the bee's knees, but they're not there yet, though they're trying really hard,\" I'd seriously consider geeyouknowing the soontobeformer PR guy. Hyperbole and spitshining and working the angles is part of the racket. That said why oh why do you, press person for the Visible Men, deign to promote an album full of perfectly OK pianocentric poptones by mentioning that two of the band members used to be in the Cherry Poppin' Daddies when that information has squat to do with the music being pimped out? I mean, it's great for me, because doing the \"they used to be That Other Group cashing in on the swing revival, but now they're making real music\" typejive fills my word count quota and saves me the trouble of getting overly blahblah about the record. The \"look how far we've come\" trick only works when selling cigarettes to women, or selling solo records to folks allergic to music not written or played by the singer. And then there are the hip reference points. XTC. Squeeze. Elvis Costello. Sure, parlay the recent fascination with oldschool new wave into some beneficial cachet for your group, even if the lovelorn nervy cleverness of those folks has the most minimal bearing on what's going on. As if one shining moment of Steve Neive emulation qualifies the group to shout out the Attractions. As if typing \"Ben Folds\" or \"Fastball\" into Word will bring down some forsaken credkilling plague upon the heads of former members of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies. As if \"word play\" involving \"all this information\" / \"get in formation\", or rhymes like, \"It's why we drink/ Or so I think\" is clever. And as if including a sixminute snoozefest like \"Pinnochio\" (guess what the hook is?) is a good idea. Those of you not agreeing with my assessment, feel free to direct the usual \"go fluff a brick with your head\" appreciation at my inbox, which I'll happily ignore. I like a lot of what's happening here, at least when the tempos are peppy. Having the range to flip from jammy organ blues to zippy doodah to sad balladry (in the same track!) is always good. And I'm a sucker for downtrodden lovesucks sentiments sung in a plaintive voice, even if the stew's a smidge overcooked at times. But there is a huge disconnect between what was promised and what ended up in my iPod. All I'm looking for is a little accountability and honesty. And maybe a little more \"Uncle Walter\" or \"Underground\". You know for kids. "}
