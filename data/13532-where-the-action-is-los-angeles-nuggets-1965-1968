Deusner","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Where the Action Is! Los Angeles Nuggets 1965-1968","text":" At some point in the mid 1960s, the kids started hanging around on Sunset Strip, which at the time was still home to many of the restaurants that once boasted famous Hollywood patrons. To curtail the invading counterculture, the city imposed a strict curfew, and cops clashed with longhairs in a series of small riots that galvanized the hippies rather than dispersed them. The skirmishes inspired Buffalo Springfield to write \"For What It's Worth\" and FourLeaf Productions to bankroll the teensploitation flick Riot on Sunset Strip, featuring a theme song by local group the Standells. It begins mundanely enough: \"I'm going down to the Strip tonight, I'm not on a stayhome trip tonight,\" sings drummer Dick Dodd over Tony Valentino's snarling guitar lick. But the song's hard beat is more of a billyclub swing than a hip shake, and the lyrics become increasingly serious, as he laments the Strip has become \"just a place for blackandwhite cars to race. It's causin' a riot!\" More pointed and angry than the square film that bears it title, the song depicts Los Angeles as a tensed city on the brink of chaos and violence, and the Standells could just as well have been singing about Watts or any of the race riots that made the curfew clashes seem polite and placid by comparison.\"Riot on Sunset Strip\" kicks off Rhino's 4xCD set Where the Action Is! Los Angeles Nuggets 19651968, setting the scene for the 100 tracks that follow. Local bands were drawing inspiration from the sights all around them, whether it was sirens on a cop car or sirens dancing in the clubs. For them, L.A. was the center of the universe, if not the entire universe itself, and these groups some of whom, in true Nuggets fashion, lasted no more than a 45 or two established a particular dialogue with the city that projected well beyond Sunset Strip and reverberated around the Valley. Arthur Lee details just such a trippy travelogue on \"You I'll Be Following\", a bouncy number from Love's debut with killer harmonies and his electric vocal. Kim Fowley's hysteric \"Underground Lady\" tries to capture the scene in the surreal slang of the times, and on \"Los Angeles\", onetime Byrd Gene Clark calls it the \"city of the doomed,\" although you might swear he's singing \"city of the dunes.\"Despite its appearance of insularity, the scene was not a closed circuit. In 1965, the Byrds charted a hit with a cover of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", and their thennew folkrock not only energized local musicians, inspiring scores of imitators and innovators, but attracted the attention of listeners, DJs, and suits across the country. Where the Action Is! picks up around this time, introducing the Byrds with \"You Movin'\", a sophisticated throwaway from their early \"preflyte\" sessions. You can hear their influence throughout the box set, as other musicians put their stamp on the sound, mixing it with gogo rhythms, psychedelic mindmelts, artrock excursions, canyon folk, and pretty much anything else that came to hand. Including bagpipes.A diverse collection of tunes that have little else in common beyond geography, Where the Action Is! depicts the L.A. scene as impossibly busy and variegated. The first two discs collect songs from some of the progenitors of the sound, who played frequently in the clubs and taverns that eventually took over the Strip. The desert eccentricities of Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band's \"Zig Zag Wanderer\" jostle with the protoflowerpower sounds of the Seeds' \"Tripmaker\" and the southwestern flair of the Bobby Fuller Four's \"Baby, My Heart\". The Rising Sons' \"Take a Giant Step\" sounds selfpropelled and gritty, at distinct odds with the Palace Guard's \"All Night Long\" and Sonny & Cher's \"It's Gonna Rain\", which sound stuffy by comparison. The Strip found room for all these disparate acts, who honed their distinctive sounds through live performance before demanding audiences.As the second disc moves beyond those clubs to document the bands around the Valley and throughout the Inland Empire, Where the Action Is! grows even heavier, more adventurous, and more diverse: There's a considerable Latino presence here, such as Thee Midniters rumbling through their energetic \"Jump, Jive & Harmonize\" and the Premiers begging you to \"Get on This Plane\". Acts like the Chymes and Penny Arkade offer very different takes on the Strip beat, suggesting the vast difference between the artists there and elsewhere. If the first half of the set emphasizes performance, the third and fourth discs examine the evolution of the studio as an instrument, whether as an agent for Thorinshield's psychedelic exploration on \"Daydreaming\" or as a tool for beefing up rock songs like Keith Allison's \"Action, Action, Action\". There's an even wider range of sounds, obviously, although the songs typically lack the hardedged grooves of the Strip bands: Jan and Dean's \"Fan Tan\" and the Yellow Balloon's \"Yellow Balloon\" even sound like commercial jingles, and Rick Nelson's kitschy \"Marshmallow Skies\" comes across as a targeted cred grab, despite his avowed advocacy of the new folk rock.But there's an even larger narrative traced by these discs, which show how the sounds that developed in clubs and bars were adopted by more ambitious and at times already established artists. There are familiar, sometimes unexpected names on the fourth disc: Tim Buckley and Randy Newman were both influenced by this scene, and their songs show littleheard aspects of their work. Peter Fonda and Hugh Masekela collaborated to record Gram Parsons' \"November Night\" (which Parsons himself never recorded), and Where the Action Is! persuasively argues for the Strip's impact on the Beach Boys by including an alternate take of \"Heroes and Villains\", whose menacing sound bite \"You're under arrest!\" sounds especially loaded in this context. Together, these four discs give the sense of an exciting rock underground arising and mutating and interacting with and changing the mainstream not just locally but nationally and internationally. It'd be 10 years before L.A.'s scene would regain this level of excitement and punk purpose, but that's another box set altogether. "}
