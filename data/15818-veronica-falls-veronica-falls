{"label":" Slumberland / Bella Union","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/16950/homepage_large.f13935b4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Lindsay Zoladz","artist":"Veronica Falls","title":"Veronica Falls","text":" At the end of the video for Veronica Falls' \"Bad Feeling\", Roxanne Clifford, the group's bobhaired singer/guitarist, clad in a dashingly fey polkadot blouse, picks up an antique book the ultimate twee signifier and lights it on fire. Given indie rock's recent janglepop overload, and the comments that Veronica Falls have made in the press (\"people like to romanticize about C86 [but] there were lots of rubbish bands associated with it...\"), it's tempting to wonder aloud: is \"Bad Feeling\" the C86 version of that video where George Michael goes iconoclastic on us and sets his own leather jacket ablaze? Well, maybe not, but at the very least it's a decent visual metaphor for the band's sound: expertly stagy revivalism with the slightest hint of mutiny. You could have said the same thing of Slumberland labelmates and fellow freshfaced indie poppers the Pains of Being Pure at Heart when they first burst out the gates with Pastels badges on their sleeves the quartet's selftitled debutÂ hits with the same sort of immediacy that that first Pains LP did. Both records do familiar things so well that, occasionally, momentarily, they actually trick you into thinking you've never heard anything like them before. But, of course, you have. In fact, if you've been paying any attention to Glasgow/London hybrid Veronica Falls, you've actually heard some of these very songs before: The single \"Found Love in a Graveyard\" made the rounds almost two years ago, and then came \"Beachy Head\", \"Bad Feeling\", and \"Come on Over\" earlier this year. But after a run of strong 7\"'s, their selftitled debut finally confirms that Veronica Falls are more than a singles band. Though they operate with a pretty limited sonic palette (boy/girl harmonies; dueling, reverbdrenched guitars; lots of tambourine), there's a sustained momentum over these 12 tracks that even manages to bring in some unexpected influences \"Beachy Head\" sounds like a zombified Mamas and the Papas thrashing at surfpunk guitars with shards of glass. Given the group's penchant for ghosts and reverb, it's tempting to grab for a familiar collection of lowhanging adjectives: dreamy, ethereal, haunting except that, actually, Veronica Falls is none of these things. There's a striking physicality to these songs, and Guy Fixsen and Ash Workman's production makes every tambourine beat hit with the clarity of a shattering window. The guitar sound is immaculate: Clifford and James Hoare's strings don't jangle so much as bristle taut chords that dart restlessly in and out of each other's way. There's a clarity of texture a specificity even to every element of the band's sound. Which makes it something of an anomaly: shoegaze that looks you square in the eye. Thematically speaking, shit's dark. There's a song called \"Misery\", there are not one but two songs in which the narrator's lover might be a ghost (\"Graveyard\", \"Bad Feeling\"), and though \"Beachy Head\" might sound like a carefree postcard from indie rock's current backdrop of choice, it's actually about jumping off a cliff and drowning yourself. Thankfully, the record ends on a high in every sense: \"Come on Over\" is perhaps the most hopeful and best track the band's got to their name. \"Crimson and clover, I'll touch your shoulder,\" Clifford sings over the mounting tension of a furiously strummed guitar. It's the Veronica Falls aesthetic in miniature: the ghosts of pop past conjured convincingly and intimately enough to feel like flesh and blood. "}
