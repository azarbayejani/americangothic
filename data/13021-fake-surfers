And over the course of four albums, the now fulltime project of exA Frames drummer Lars Finberg has loosened up its formative postpunk pessimism to the point that the band's chosen MySpace URL www.myspace.com/theworldisadrag feels more ironic with each record. Rather than simply protest the indignities of modern life, on Fake Surfers, Finberg goes about creating a sanctuary from it, inviting in friends from fellow unsung West Coast indie rock acts (and, in one instance, covering their songs) to form a secret, protective society that will ensure the survival of rationalthinking species in a world where brain cells are being eroded 140 characters at a time.The Intelligence's previous release, 2007's Deuteronomy, was notable for its more focused songcraft and cleaner presentation, but Fake Surfers doesn't continue these new adventures in hifi. Rather, it plays to the Intelligence's extremes, casting a more pronounced British Invasion pop influence in warped, peaklevel lofi sonics, emphasizing a connection between postpunk and psychedelia that stretches from Clinic and Guided by Voices through the deconstructionist pop of Swell Maps and Wire and back to the whimsical wordsmithery of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence. (That said, Fake Surfers practically sounds like Dark Side of the Moon compared to Crepuscule With Pacman, a concurrently released collection of more discordant, halfformed material issued via French indie Born Bad.)Fake Surfers' noise/pop affinities seemingly align it with the current lofi vogue fostered by Slumberland and Slitbreeze Records sets, with the tambourinerattled \"Taxman\" strut of \"Tower\" and bobbleheaded harmonies of \"Universal Babysitter\" suggesting mid1960s Beatles had they been signed to Rough Trade Records in 1978. But the Intelligence are distinguished by the way they push the limits of their claustrophobic space; their most intriguing moments often result when they lay off the distortion pedal, exposing the creepy voices and radio frequencies that overwhelm the swinging60s gogo groove of \"Saint Bartolomeu\" and the circular circus melodies driving the electrostroll of \"I Hear Depression\". And while it seems like faint praise to say the best song on Fake Surfers is its lone cover, the breezily strummed rendition of L.A. newwave hot dogs Wounded Lion's \"Pony People\" feels like the song Finberg's been waiting to sing his whole life. Lord knows what it says about the man that he's never sounded happier than when singing from the perspective of a centaur \"firing arrows into rabbits.\" But in the case of Fake Surfers, such emotional breakthroughs are worth sacrificing a bunny or two.
