{"label":" Sub Pop","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/15009/homepage_large.248fa37e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andrew Gaerig","artist":"The Ruby Suns","title":"Fight Softly","text":" Pop music success requires good timing no local or unsigned band will debate this and the Ruby Suns have shitty timing. Their breakthrough album, Sea Lion, dropped in the early spring of 2008; it was a fun, loose take on Panda Bear's seaside psychedelia. Last summer, many indie fans fell hard for a smattering of artists Washed Out, Neon Indian that echoed the same bigwave aesthetic as the Suns. Justice would see head Sun Ryan McPhun return to claim a spot at the picnic table, but Fight Softly mostly abandons the gentle soufulness and playful strums of Sea Lion in favor of stale electronics and busy loops.The departure from Sea Lion is apparent immediately: Twinkling ambience and dollops of synthesizer open Fight Softly. The rhythms remain bouncy and ebullient, but simple, slapping drum machines weigh them down. The Suns used to sneak in bits of odd percussion and puns on world music (\"Kenya Dig It?\"), but McPhun's sound design is unable to harness that kind of nuance and adventure. The resulting compositions seem full of color but lacking in depth or space: drum thwacks and buzzing keyboards caulk every track.McPhun has taken to singing with melisma, twisting simple lyrics into meandering phrasings. He takes almost 30 seconds to sing the album's first line: \"It's my turn in the front seat\" (many of his lyrics address this sort of innocence and alienation). At his best, like on \"Closet Astrologer\", he recalls Arthur Russell's awkward, thrilling navigation, but McPhun often lacks Russell's coy balance.McPhun's voice seems incongruous with his songwriting. He seems languid and relaxed over \"Cinco\"'s aggressive shifts. On album closer \"Olympics on Pot\", he idles over sweet, furtive drumming. (For those of you who cried foul about Animal Collective lyrics like those in \"My Girls\": sharpen your knives.) \"How Kids Fail\" is almost oppressively anthemic, its huge keyboard stabs weighing down one of the album's better verses. \"Cranberry\" inexplicably shifts from a charging, abstract march to a plodding pop song to a rummy party jam. Fight Softly constantly jars and pivots, but with little purpose.Animal Collective remain the obvious sonic touchstone for the Ruby Suns damn if \"Dusty Fruit\" doesn't sound like a diet version of \"Brother Sport\" but McPhun's best work exhibits a surprisingly formalist synthpop streak. \"Haunted House\"'s bouncing pads and treated vocal samples sound like a pillowy Cut Copy. The penultimate \"Two Humans\" is a delicate love ballad \"When are you leaving?/ And will you stay the night\" that sounds like the Junior Boys on vacation. \"Closet Astrologer\" is a paean to introverts that tries to parse young adulthood (\"I'll find time to do what I want/ Whatever that is\").These moments aren't indicative of Fight Softly's general tenor, though. The album sits heavily, uneasily, even when its mood is light. It's a true departure in sound and method; this is not a lazy or complacent record. McPhun, though, never settles into these new sounds, and Fight Softly retains very little of the ease and abandon that, to date, had marked the Ruby Suns. "}
