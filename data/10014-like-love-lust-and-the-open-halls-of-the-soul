Deusner","artist":"Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter","title":"Like Love Lust and the Open Halls of the Soul","text":"  Jesse Sykes knows what you want: \"Tell me what you need to see,\" she sings elegantly on \"Eisenhower Moon\", the first track on her third album. The answer: \"half sadness, half fury.\" That Like Love Lust and the Open Halls of the Soul will veer more toward fury than sadness doesn't become apparent until the second song, \"LLL\" (one of two de facto title tracks), which builds to a forceful conclusion that would have been unthinkable on either of the band's previous albums. Where those records trafficked a lustrous yet monlithic folk rock that matched Sykes' voluminous voice, Like Love Lust and the Open Halls of the Soul, on the other hand, is just as adventurous as that lengthy title promises, changing up moods and music and taking Sykes and the band outside their comfort zone: from the skipping indignation of \"You Might Walk Away\" and the outright outrage of \"I Like the Sound\" to the psychedelic wonder of \"Spectral Beings\" to the gentle gospel drift of \"The Air Is Thin\". The band incorporates an impressive array of styles and sounds SoCal pop, desert rock, country, and folk into these songs to create its own \"cosmic American music,\" to borrow Gram Parsons' phrase. Certainly they want to expound upon the past, not to replicate it, which makes Like Love Lust their most adventurous album to date, and in some ways their most calculated and selfconscious. Sykes' voice, which sounds like Marianne Faithfull's if she'd hailed from the American Southwest, is the perfect instrument for communicating this concoction of emotions, but in finding new ways to use her voice, her reach occasionally exceeds her grasp. She never sounds entirely comfortable among the handclaps on the upbeat \"You Might Walk Away\" or the Fifth Dimension bumbumbumbumba's on the jarring \"I Like the Sound\" or the loungey horns on \"Aftermath\". On the other hand, she's right at home singing the la la la's of \"Station Grey\" and sighing the airy backdrop of \"Spectral Beings\", as grainy and atmospheric as a Jarmusch film. Sykes creates a choir of herselves on \"How Will We Know?\", which builds to a lovely desert coda one of the album's many potential showclosers. By contrast, Sykes's songwriting voice is never as coolly confident on Like Love Lust as her physical voice. Over three albums, however, she has developed a flair for elliptical imagery, giving the impression that she writes as a means to search for some larger truth. If Sykes' quest leads her to vague sentiments about raindrops on broken glass and the soul's open corridors, more often than not it makes the songs sound even more earthily enigmatic. Even though Sykes gets first billing, her three albums are as much about the Sweet Hereafter as they are about her. The rhythm section of Bill Herzog and Eric Eagle rumble dependably, and Anne Marie Ruljancich's violin hovers curiously throughout the album. In exWhiskeytowner Phil Wandscher especially, she's found an ideal musical partner, the Emmylou to her Gram Parsons. Wandscher's playing sounds looser and even more central to the songs than on previous efforts. \"LLL\" builds to a close on his whitewater solo, and \"Hard Not to Believe\" rumbles sensuously with his descending chords. Especially at the end of \"How Will We Know?\" and \"Station Grey\", his guitar and Sykes's voice intertwine naturally and closely, striking the perfect equilibrium on an album that often feels out of balance.
