{"label":" 4AD","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/7555/homepage_large.1295f034.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Ott","artist":"Sybarite","title":"Nonument","text":" For all the pasttense praise of Talk Talk in recent months and you can thank our walleyed Oxford savior for much of it few artists are pursuing the sparse, delicate synthesis of pop and jazz Mark Hollis wove on Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. Sybarite's 4AD debut Nonument opens with a more danceable, yet comparably pensive collage of horns, strings and beats, \"Secropia\". Although the record fails to pursue its great Viennatone sound further, or to develop a perceptible trajectory, Sybarite's first proper fulllength is a remarkable collection of IDM when you consider the genre's recent downturn in both purity and quality. Now operating on Microsoft's radar he's just composed the score for an MSNBC documentary on Iraq titled The Next War Sybarite's success is an equal result of effort, talent and luck. After joining singer Simeon in a largely ignored bid to revive the legendary psychedelic outfit Silver Apples in 1996, Christian \"Xian\" Hawkins set out as Sybarite, recording a trio of limitedrun seveninch records, one for then upandcoming purveyors of cool, UK label Static Caravan. Another flashpoint label, Temporary Residence, released his debut fulllength Musicforafilm in 1997; the label and Hawkins rode each other on a synergistic wave of midlevel exposure, sharing equally in chic praise. Musicforafilm wasn't often taken at face value, but it's actually intended as a soundtrack, and sounds nothing like Sybarite's more beatdriven singles, compiled as Placement Issues in 2001. Given Hawkins' history, it was no great shock to find a solid independent like 4AD had signed him up. Nonument is in many ways Sybarite's first fulllength album, and it houses only a pair of questionable junior varsity elements: Humpback whale samples on \"Renzo Piano\", and the Ovaltreated acoustic guitar of \"The Fourth Day\". Beyond these standout standards, the only real problem is academic: Tracks titled after legendarily lunatic surrealist Unica Zurn and the aforementioned architectural icon Renzo Piano indicate an irksome level of pretentiousness that could only be justified by a groundbreaking effort, and much of Nonument could pass for Burger/Ink's albeit beautiful bathwater. Vocals on \"The Fourth Day\", \"Water\" and \"Fresh Kills\" immediately conjure Piano Magic, Mahogany, and, on the latter, an IDM His Name Is Alive, which, given his new home on 4AD, is not a sound Sybarite should be exploring. Two fine ambient pieces \"The Accidental Triumph\" and the closing \"Three Sided\" explore the more eclectic sounds and spacious territory of \"Secropia\", but develop only a few captivating mood shifts, most notably during their finales. \"Accidental Triumph\" is most alluring, a jazzinspired lament that could pass for a less psychedelic rendition of Spectrum's \"Neon Sigh\". Xian Hawkins' greatest talent might be his perseverance. Sybarite deals almost exclusively with the mid90s beats and tones of Warp Records' heyday, refusing to succumb to the novelty obsession that's reduced glitchpeppered IDM to the same game of catchup that brought jungle and house down. \"Homegrown Cultures\" and \"Leap Year\" are the two clearest examples of this, and while they're perhaps too easily compared to early Mouse on Mars or Plaid, these are Hawkins' finest moments outside Nonument's first track, which makes, and in setting our hopes too high, breaks an excellent record.
