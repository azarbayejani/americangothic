Last night I was playing ElekTro4's debut LP, Keystroke One, at the coffee shop where I work. I noticed a bespectacled grad student tapping his Pumas to the languid cadences of ElekTro4's fluid basslines, splashy drums, jazzy breaks, and hiphop vocal samples and cuts. As he approached the counter for a refill, I could see the fated question massing upon his lips like a thunderhead. Then the storm broke as he gestured vaguely upward, toward the music: \"Is this DJ Shadow?\" A million pleasant but unexceptional instrumental hiphop records has been DJ Shadow's uneasy legacy, and while Keystroke One leans into the more vivid end of the spectrum, forgoing some modern instrumental rap's fixation on boringly beautiful drones in favor of sharp, smart urban landscaping, it feels as if Y2K never happened. ElekTro4 is still partying like it's 1999, or maybe even 1995, and heads everywhere are suddenly remembering how much they dug Mr. Scruff back in the day. The problem with this sort of music (we used to call it triphop) in the here and now is that the two main things that made it sound hot in the '90s its newness and its technological advances are obsolete. Progress is a bitch. Still, it's good audio wallpaper if not an attention magnet, and the execution is wicked sharp. The album is divided into two movements, the first of which is \"Portrait of the City\". This is where ElekTro4 does that \"rendering the city as grimy crucible of humanity\" thang, incorporating city sounds like hissing train doors into stark horn breaks and clipped drum patterns, and on a recent trip to Brooklyn, it flowed just fine with the graffitisplashed labyrinth of Williamsburg. Sixtoo's crisp production is a boon to this gusty urban melodrama, and on tracks like \"Chasin' Trains\", the topheavy live drums steal the show from the sparse instrumental track, while \"Jaywalking\" relies more on vocal samples to shape its ominous pulse: Ghostface licking shots at 14karat gold slum computer wizards &c.;  Part two, \"The Suicide Suite\", backs off from hiphop a bit for a more eclectic metropolitan survey, from the morphing dub plate \"Three Views of a Secret\", to the Latin syncopation of \"Searching for Answers\", to the indiefolksy trills and surges of \"The Explain Nation\" and \"A House with no Mirrors\". Overall, Keystroke One is another fine and evocatively grainy snapshot of the city in a photo album already threatening to sunder its bindings.  "}
