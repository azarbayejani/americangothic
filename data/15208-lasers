{"label":" Atlantic","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/16309/homepage_large.33b32019.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Lupe Fiasco","title":"Lasers","text":" One of the few things more depressing than actually listening to Lupe Fiasco's new album, Lasers, is imagining the monumentally emasculating studio sessions it took to make it. It's easy for label heads to see the commercial success of arenarap like \"Empire State of Mind\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" or crossover debuts such as Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday and B.o.B.'s The Adventures of Bobby Ray (Lupe turned down the Alex Da Kid beats to \"Airplanes\" and the Smeezingtons' \"Nothin' on You\")  as a public mandate for more of the same. But wouldn't it just be easier to find someone down for the cause rather than to remake the public persona of someone who's already established? Lasers simply sounds bad, playing against every single one of Lupe Fiasco's strengths and creating new weaknesses. Surveying the current poprap landscape and retaining nothing worthwhile, it's at once chaotic, bored, and yet unyieldingly abrasive overblown, forced choruses, rawk guitar tracks that had to be laid down by a guy with a ponytail, mixing as subtle as a numetal record. There's a guy on several of these songs singing putrid hooks through what sounds like vocal filters retrieved from Dan Deacon's recycle bin he's named MDMA. This is a coincidence of cosmic proportions. And then there's single \"The Show Goes On\", so gallingly lazy, I'm at least willing to view it as some sort of nextlevel parody of A&Rs asleep in the hit factory it would certainly be a more clever indictment than \"Dumb It Down\". This is one that \"interpolates\" Modest Mouse and trades Isaac Brock's fuckall optimism for Lasers' most blatant attempt to siphon juice from Recovery's redemptionstory treacle. Look, \"Float On\" is a great song, not a sacred text but interpolated into a halfBranson, halfDisney brass fanfare somehow cheapens it worse than any appearance on Kidz Bop or \"American Idol\". But if this was simply \"man, shame about some of the beats and hooks,\" someone might assume they stumbled onto a review of Food & Liquor or The Cool. Whether it's selfsabotage or a total lack of inspiration, the major difference here is that Lupe isn't working hard or playing hard. Doing just enough to escape his 16 bars before the next bombshell chorus blows, he fills his verses with guhinducing wordplay, onenote concepts (the central metaphor of \"Out of My Head\" was deep enough to support a Drew Barrymore/Hugh Grant movie), or stock attempts at anguish (\"Beautiful Lasers (2 Ways)\"), uplift (\"Coming Up\"), and nonconformity (\"State Run Radio\"). You can't knock him for trying something new, but the tools he should be using his rubbery wordplay, thoughtful commentary, sheer love of the art form get ditched, with nothing interesting to replace them. This is mostly true even on the songs that sound like Atlantic's reward to Lupe for holding up his end of the bargain. Or maybe I'm wrong about all this and in time, Lasers will make the bean counters happy enough to grant Lupe the resources to and freedom to do whatever he envisions as his classic. Then again, his emo past is well noted as is the chip on his shoulder. Lupe often has enough trouble staying out of his own way, yet Lasers doesn't suffer for that reason; it just feels like the flaming wreckage of a project that never had a prayer. "}
