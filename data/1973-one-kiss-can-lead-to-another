A large number of its songs are widely loved, of course, but to many critics and listeners, the peak of girlgroup music (roughly 196265) is considered an era of frivolity and disposability, a manufactured postPayola placeholder rightfully eradicated from the airwaves by the British Invasion.Granted, the girlgroup sound was cynically designed to be ephemeral, the work of highly competitive yet mostly faceless songwriters working out of Brill Building cubicles. Little concern was given to artist development, and the singers themselves many of whom were black were rarely promoted as vigorously as their rock'n'roll progenitors, partially due to labels' fears that television performances would reveal their skin color and thus alienate potential listeners. The music, however, has persevered, even proving itself massively important and influential, despite its marginalization by an industry that mythologizes and profits from the past by lionizing largerthanlife personalities and/or albumoriented artists rather than pop singles.Rhino does its part to make amends for some of that marginalization with its lovingly compiled 4xCD, 120track girlgroup box One Kiss Can Lead to Another, a nearperfect combination of quality, necessity, song selection, sequencing, informative liner notes, and packaging. Crucially, the compilers were liberal with their definition of girlgroup music, incorporating not just doowop and/or gospelinfluenced female vocal teams such as the Chiffons, the Shirelles, the Cookies, and the ShangriLa's but also combos and solo artists from a variety of musical styles, including R&B, garage rock, country, protopsych, and Northern and blueeyed soul. British singers such as Petula Clark, Sandie Shaw, Cilla Black, and Dusty Springfield are afforded places here as are, ironically, tracks made popular by Brit Invasion artists such as the Beatles, Hollies, Moody Blues, and Herman's Hermits. Familiar artists such as Cher and Dolly Parton appear in atypical guises, but most of the widely recognizable names are working behind the scenes: Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, Brian Wilson, Neil Diamond, Jimmy Webb, Randy Newman, and Cat Stevens all feature in the liner notes, alongside Brill Building songwriting staples such as Goffin/King, Mann/Weil, and Barry/Greenwich.The most notable absence is Phil Spector, whose dense Wall of Sound production style and proclivity for melodramatic lyrics were the benchmarks and templates for much of girlgroup music. But then, that's just as well, since anyone willing to purchase this affordable set will also want to own Spector's Back to Mono box, which includes the major hits by artists like the Crystals, the Ronettes, Darlene Love, and others. Of course, the inability to license Spector's tracks made it impossible for the set's creators to compile a definitive genre box; wisely, they instead cast a wide net and included mostly nonhits, unearthing a collection of tracks that will appeal to both girlgroup neophytes and acolytes.Unsurprisingly, the most common subject matter on a set of girlgroup songs is boys boys who lie and cheat, boys who drive a wedge between girls and their parents or friends, boys who feed off of dependency and low selfesteem, boys who trick girls into thinking it's love when it's lust. As the title implies, one kiss leads to two, two kisses can lead to three, and eventually it can lead to doing more than a good girl should. On One Kiss, it can also lead to rationalizing distress (the uncommon diet advice on the Fabulettes' \"Try the Worryin' Way\"), longlasting emotional scars (P.P. Arnold's \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\"), becoming trapped in cycles of emotional abuse and dependency (Lesley Gore's \"What Am I Gonna Do With You?\", on which she guesses \"I'm just the girl you stay with/ To see what you can get away with\"), and heartache (the Flirtations' Northern soul classic \"Nothing But a Heartache\", among many others). At its most extreme, one kiss can also lead to unwanted pregnancy (the Lovelites' \"How Can I Tell My Mom and Dad?\") and even murderous jealousy (the Whyte Boots' vicious girlfight in \"Nightmare\").Crushes entail risk, like an emotional choose your own adventure, but risks can also pay off, and it's that belief that colors many of the tracks. The heartache of the set's most melodramatic tracks is balanced by happy endings, improbably joyous and exuberant music, and the power of selfactualization and empowerment. It sounds quaint today, but a teenage girl building an identity, making her own choices, and gaining measures of selfrespect were still largely new ideas in the 1960s. The protagonists here might make a lot of wrong decisions from the ShangriLa's lamenting their bad boy gone good in \"Out in the Streets\" to Evie Sands offering herself mind, soul, but mostly body on \"Take Me For a Little While\" but simply having the opportunity to voice their thoughts or follow their hearts and minds are things their mothers couldn't sometimes do. This spirit is reflected in songs like the Chiffons' psychtinged anthem \"Nobody Knows What's Going On (In My Mind But Me)\", the pentup struggle between lust and loyalty in Elle Greenwich's \"You Don't Know\", Twinkle's death ballad \"Terry\", the What Four's sexasaweapon track \"I'm Gonna Destroy That Boy\", and Wanda Jackson's sexually charged \"Funnel of Love\", each of which are revolutionary in their own quiet way.In the past 40 years the music featured on One Kiss has served as a touchstone for a wide variety of artists, most notably 1970s New Yorkers (the Ramones, Bruce Springsteen, New York Dolls, Blondie, Martin Scorsese), 1980s Brits (the Smiths, Jesus & Mary Chain, the Field Mice, the Cocteau Twins), and contemporary indie stars (Saint Etienne, Magnetic Fields, the Avalanches, the Concretes). We've even enjoyed a lengthy postSpice Girls/Aaliyah resurgence of girlgroup music via hiphop/R&B, dance and electropop, teen pop vets, and UK chart acts such as Girls Aloud and Sugababes.One of the saddest quirks of rock criticism is that the hopes, dreams, and fears of teen girls are frequently considered frolicsome fluff while the rage and defiance of teen boys is miscast as the articulation of free thinkers. And yet, it's the girls in part, because they're more likely to function as mouthpieces for adult songwriters who examine universal subjects such as love, romance, selfactualization, selfconfidence, and personal politics, while young rock bands often simply reject growing up, fight responsibility, and wear that struggle as a badge of pride. Both approaches can work, of course, but unlike a sneer, a kiss never goes out of style. "}
