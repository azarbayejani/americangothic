But the outcome of Blur's initial early00s dissolution tells a different story: While Coxon's foil/nemesis Damon Albarn has successfully transformed himself from NME pinup into a globetrotting Afropop fusionist with a penchant for genreblurring supergroup collaborations, Coxon's output comes off as relatively conservative in comparison.Â With eight albums under his belt, Coxon's amassed a discography larger than Blur's, but whether he's indulging in Nick Drakean folk whimsy or Buzzcockian punk raveups, he's mostly stayed true to time and MOJOhonored British musical traditions. Rather than amass a body of work that charts a consistent artistic evolution, Coxon deals mostly in reactionary gestures. His previous outing, 2009's The Spinning Top, was a sprawling, psychfolk song cycle so you know A+E is going to be anything but. However, even by the standards of Coxon's previous punkrock regressiontherapy sessions (like 2004's \"Freakin' Out\" or 2006's \"Don't Let Your Man Know\"), A+E is aggressively dark and primitive, as if his old band's recent reunion stints inspired Coxon to reassert the mischievous contrarian character that made him the discerning Blur fan's favorite. If your list of alltime Blur jams includes \"Bugman\", \"Bank Holiday\", or \"B.L.U.R.E.M.I.\", step right up: opener \"Advice\" and \"Running for Your Life\" surge forth with similar proportions of buzzsawguitar bluster and sneeringly sardonic cultural commentary. (\"Bah Singer\" is another similarly fashioned inthered exercise and, while its lyrics are just a touch too distorted to decipher, the song assumes a far more playful tone if you imagine it's about Albarn.) What really gives A+E its grotty edge is not Coxon's familiarly fractious guitarplaying (in bountiful supply here), but a newfound penchant for pawnshop synths and drummachine beats that lend the songs a mechanistic menace. \"City Hall\" doesn't amount to much other than a single lyric repeated over a ceaseless motorik pulse, but Coxon invests the skeletal structure with a rich sense of atmosphere, thanks to ominous blurts of saxophone and teasing guitar lines that cast the track as a pocketsized version of Can's \"Mother Sky\". The eerily disquieting \"Knife in the Cast\" is an even more atypical move for Coxon, and all the more captivating for it: Coming on like the Young Marble Giants played at 16 rpm, this sparse, bassdriven ballad serves as a blank canvas onto which Coxon can project all kinds of freakiness dubby drum breaks, subliminal chatter, and queasily incessant guitar squeals that feel like a blade being slowly twisted into an open wound. But if A+E's spartan sound feels refreshingly raw and visceral in the wake of The Spinning Top's meandering acoustic meditations, it also too readily exposes the instrumental and conceptual limitations of its lesser material. In both synthpop form and gettheindiekidsmoving sentiment, \"What It'll Take\" (\"to make you people dance,\" goes the rest of the titular command) feels like it's at least 10 years too late for the electroclash party, while Coxon should be a good 20 years beyond the simplistic singlesscene musings of \"Meet+Drink+Pollinate\". And if the 10tune tracklist at first appears more compact than The Spinning Top's 15song slog, A+E still succumbs to its own excesses: The saxedup postpunk boogie of \"Seven Naked Valleys\" chugs along for nearly six minutes but abruptly cuts out just as a piercing synth frequency threatens to destabilize it into something more interesting. It's likewise something of a shame that a record featuring some of Coxon's most adventurous work as a solo artist should end with the noncommittal Beckian countryfunk of \"Ohh, Yeh, Yeh\", a song that doesn't so much close A+E as bring it to an unceremonious, sputtering halt. Like the similarly titled Spiritualized album of 2008, A+E refers to the accidentandemergency wards found in British hospitals, the UK equivalent of our ER rooms. And looking at the scrapedknee photo that features on its cover, you're left wishing the album drew a little more blood to make the stay truly worthwhile. "}
