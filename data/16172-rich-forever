Ross was a successful artist before he ever hooked up with Luger, but his stunning transition from begrudgingly accepted popular rapper to one of the genre's most respected artists can basically be traced directly back to Luger's beat for \"B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)\", the song that will go down as the indelible single of Ross' career. The beat was so titanic that Ross who had gone to great pains to protect the selfconstructed image of himself as an opulent drug kingpin shouted a chorus where he imagined himself as genuine, reallife drug kingpins Big Meech and Larry Hoover. In one fell swoop, Ross tore down his carefully assembled existence while simultaneously building up the one that paved the way for the career surge he's riding, which has culminated in Rich Forever, the new mixtape that now stands as his artistic pinnacle. \"B.M.F.\" is genius for many reasons, but there is one crucial aspect of the song that makes Rich Forever tick: It was the first time that Ross ever really got mean. It's almost incredible to consider, but despite his stature and physical presence, \"B.M.F.\" was the first intimidating Ross track since his debut single \"Hustlin'\", the first since then that pumped a dangerous amount of adrenaline into your veins. In the four years between those songs, Ross kept everything but wealth and women at a distance. He chose cinematic, orchestral beats that colored that image perfectly, and while it was no doubt an effective strategy, songs like \"Maybach Music 2\" are the equivalent of a living room in a mansion where you'd be afraid to touch any of the furniture. \"B.M.F.\" was Rick Ross as Dave Chappelle as Rick James yelling \"fuck yo' couch,\" except the couch was actually his own. It was exactly what his career needed. Luger produces only one song on Rich Forever, but his fingerprints are all over the mixtape, and its roots are firmly in \"B.M.F.\". It's the first Rick Ross fulllength with an attitude, and the result is a record where it finally feels like something's at stake for the Teflon Don. The aggrieved sneer of \"…these motherfuckers mad that I'm icy!\" permeates the album, and the energy derived from Ross' contempt adds an important dimension to his character, one that was missing when he got too comfortable making 1,000threadcount music. The best beats here the ones that act as the backbone of the album are appropriately sinister, and actually improve on the Luger template that has dominated street rap for the past 18 months. There's the grinding churn of \"MMG Untouchable\", the haunted house bombast of \"King of Diamonds\", and the appropriately glistening keys of \"Yella Diamonds\", beats so good they render Luger's lone actual production (\"Off the Boat\") totally unnecessary. The opening quarter of Rich Forever especially drips with disdain, and though deviations into radio pop and the lush instrumentation he's long cultivated do pop up, Ross sets a tone for the record early that courses through every track that follows. \"B.M.F.\" did happen to crest with his marked improvement as a writer, but it also magnified Ross' ability to pen spectacularly outlandish and vivid boasts, and he stuffs a vast number of them into the first four or five tracks here. Ross calling his chain \"the ghetto's guillotine\" on \"High Definition\" or his Corvette \"so clean you'll think Bruce Springsteen rent that\" on \"Fuck 'Em\" or conveying his hunger for money by hilariously seething that he \"likes his nachos hot\" on \"MMG Untouchable\" is the mark of the Don at work, not content to merely build verses around the names of luxury sunglasses brands. And when he does retreat back to the throne for a regal track like \"Keys to the Crib\" later on the album, there's an undeniably spiteful glee in his voice that's missing from his earlier albums. Ross has jarred himself out of his comfort zone and gotten his hands dirty, and in doing so he's also fleshed out an image of the boss as paranoid and constantly peeking over his shoulder. \"Last Breath\", which smartly tabs Meek Mill (Ross' top underling) and Birdman (the bossest of all rap bosses) for guest verses, undercuts images of ringside seats and allwhite Beamers with a feeling of queasy desperation and lurking mistrust. Then there's \"Stay Schemin'\" which perfectly deploys a zonkedout French Montana to mumblesing a hook about staying one step ahead of plotting enemies. Montana sounds so stoned that it brings to mind the image of Tony Montana lurching his head up from a pile of cocaine, and it's a fascinating, if not bizarre, end to an album that starts with Ross at his absolute meanest. \"God forgives, I don't,\" is a phrase that pops up from time to time on Rich Forever, and fittingly it's slated to serve as the title of Ross' upcoming album. He'd been batting around the slogan long before this mixtape existed, but Rich Forever adds vindictive muscle to a motto that at one point might have come off as a hollow attempt at branding. It's a record that uses nastiness to cement the character \"Rick Ross\" as threedimensional, and uses a barrage of bangers to cement the rapper Rick Ross as an undeniable force. "}
