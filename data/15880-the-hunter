{"label":" Reprise","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/17012/homepage_large.28f5ca9e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brandon Stosuy","artist":"Mastodon","title":"The Hunter","text":" Mastodon chose the right time to scale back the concepts. For 2002's Remission, they focused on fire; 2004's Leviathan, water (and Moby Dick); 2006's Blood Mountain, earth (plus a vision quest up the side of the title's mountain); and 2009's Crack the Skye, aether, linking astral travel, wormholes, Rasputin, possession, and the suicide of drummer Brann Dailor's sister Skye. There's no way to follow that, so for their fifth album, The Hunter, they offer 13 stylistically and lyrically varied tracks. The title references the death of guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds' brother, who suffered a heart attack while hunting last December, but there's no overarching thread. Despite the heaviness of that kind of information, the record works best as a catchy guiltypleasure party album there's a song about sex in zero gravity, another about the Swamp Thing, one titled \"Bedazzled Finger Nails\". Instead of worrying about a storyline they can barely explain in interviews, Mastodon put the complexities into the songwriting and vocal harmonies. The Hunter is longer than Crack the Skye by a couple of minutes, but it feels briefer. As the band itself noted early on, it comes over like a Mastodon mixtape. The Atlanta sludge veterans have never taken the easy way out, sure, but they've also never cycled between so many styles: We get crusty snarling dotted with spacedout moments (\"Black Tongue\" and its \"I burned out my eyes/ I cut off my tongue\" welcome), funky, psychedelic heavy rock (\"Curl of the Burl\"), crazy keyboard noodles (\"Bedazzled Finger Nails\"), meditative, progressive Milky Way excursions (\"Stargasm\"), hammering techpsych anthems with crazyclimber riffs (\"Octopus Has No Friends\"). Outside that, \"Blasteroid\" could almost pass as Torche. Really, it's like pressing buttons at random on a jukebox. Mastodon 2011 are largely about restless experimentation. The Hunter is the quartet's first collection with cover art by someone other than Paul Romano. They recorded it with hiphop and Maroon 5 producer Mike Elizondo, the guy who cowrote 50 Cent's \"In Da Club\", and the Game's \"Higher\".  It also features the first track sung entirely by Dailor. They use a Theremin. The sound is certainly chewier and, at times, more pop than usual. Two of the best songs the fuzzed singalong \"All the Heavy Lifting\" and the slowly unfurling title track deliver memorable, vaguely radiofriendly choruses. But there's also the techheavy weirdness of \"Bedazzled Finger Nails\", a pretty, stumbling track that offers mathy psychedelia with a variety of vocal approaches (though I could do without the synth squiggles). As you might expect from a record this jumbled, there are parts that lag. Here, they sequenced three duds together, the generic classic rock of \"Dry Bone Valley\", the midtempo \"The Thickening\", with its sexy oohs and ahhs, and Brann Dailor's Syd Barrettlike \"The Creature Lives\", a song that opens with more than a minute of Moog and laughter. (Note: It's not a great idea to follow one of your throwaway tracks with more than a minute of Moog and laughter.) They come back strong with \"Spectrelight\", a burnt offering sung by  regular guest Neurosis' Scott Kelly, and the pretty finale, \"The Sparrow\", a track dedicated to the band's accountant's wife, who died of stomach cancer. Lyrically, they simply, rather beautifully, repeat her supposed life motto: \"Pursue happiness with diligence.\" It feels like The Hunter's motto, too. I do miss the grit, heavylifting, and larger excavations of their earlier work nothing merits tossing around the word \"epic\" here but what they do, and what they've become, is fascinating. I ended my review of Blood Mountain by jokingly referring to the guys as the new \"Monsters of Rock.\" They went on to play the festival of the same name the next year, but I was more talking about the ascension of a new brand of mainstream heavy metal, one that would sit beside Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and others of their ilk. What I hadn't expected was that, a few years later, it would make more sense to pair them with Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, and other guys not afraid to spend an entire set smiling. "}
