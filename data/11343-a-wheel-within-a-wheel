Athens, Ohio? Not so much. If that makes the college town's Southeast Engine relatively big fish in a small pond, that still hardly means many people have heard the band splashing around. Indeed, 2005's mostly overlooked Coming to Terms With Gravity was solid if not wholly compelling Americana in the justleftoftraditional mold (think: Wilco), though clearly leader Adam Remnant wasn't completely comfortable being pegged as altcountry. If A Wheel Within a Wheel isn't exactly the sound of a band casting off its shackles, it is the sound of a band at least buckling a little to conventions. Instrumentally, with its emphasis on rootsy piano and strings, much of A Wheel Within a Wheel still scans as Americana. It's the substance where things get stretched a bit, with strong, personal, sometimes powerful results that potentially could raise the group's profile.A Wheel Within a Wheel begins with a cynical epiphany, blasted out with the opening \"Taking the Fall\". It's not necessarily an exceptional song, but it does set the tone for the rest of the disc. \"Now it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust/ Well, I've always done what I've wanted but now I do what I must,\" proclaims Remnant, and that same disillusionment with the inevitable winds its way through nearly every track. Love/hate, life/death, truth/lies the album's nothing so much as a series of bitter revelations that the innocence of youth is an illusion, and that anyone looking only to man for guidance is doomed.  The title A Wheel Within a Wheel is a reference to the book of Ezekiel, where god is depicted as a sort of multidimensional hallucinogenic elemental vision, four creatures combined as one, accompanied by lightning, fire, and noise. Said wheel makes a few appearances throughout the album, most notably following as overt a cry for help as you can get, a song not so subtly titled \"Oh God, Let Me Back In\". Yet A Wheel Within a Wheel is more complex than the average Christian rock tract. The Biblical/religious imagery running throughout the disc doesn't tip the group's hand so much as provide the album a fruitful thematic framework as Remnant shouts into the abyss in search of answers.  Given the neotheological angst of the album, it's not much of a shock that the music often matches the soul dividing sturm und drang driving the disc. It's rock opera, part Dante, part indie du jour, bombastic, to be sure, but never hectoring as it makes its way to moral d√©tente. In fact, the album's plea to god comes not as righteousness but only after Remnant himself (or at least the album's narrator) hits rock bottom. \"Taking the Fall\" (\"fall\" being a particularly loaded word here) and \"Ostrich\" tackle the trauma of learning life isn't always fair, and, hey, we're all going to die some day, anyway. In the brisk \"We Have You Surrounded\", cynicism and doubt have totally taken over, the divine gift of free will subverted to reject the attendant catches. In \"Quit While You're Ahead\", Remnant is desperate for some guidance: \"Tell me what I believe,\" he pleads.  By \"Pursuit of Happiness\" (in two parts), the aimlessness of nihilism begins to weigh on his soul. \"When the facts turn into fiction, your voice is overturned/ Do you still believe in nothing?\" He's answered in \"Psychoanalysis\", where recollections of childhood give way to the telltale vision of the wheel within a wheel and, as far as the story goes, a fateful choice: embrace the \"State of Oblivion\", or look to the lord for salvation? The album goes the latter route, if only because it makes for a much better narrative arc. Between the end of the world and everlasting happiness, goes the reasoning, why would anyone choose the former?  Needless to say, the aforementioned explicit cry for god's forgiveness is answered and accepted, but to Remnant's credit all is not left neat and tidy. If anything, the comfort of god makes life more bearable but no more fair. \"All I've been taught to really know turns to dust or turns to stone,\" concludes \"Fortune Teller\". But in the concluding \"Let It Be So\", that doesn't seem as bad as it sounds. Remnant's been tested and emerged stronger, the knowledge of injustice and pain not a curse but the key to move beyond empty fatalism. God's gift, it turns out, is allowing us to know that the future is what we make of it.  \"So let Fortune turn her wheel, and let the serpent take its tail out of its mouth,\" sings Remnant, finally at ease with the understanding that happiness is his, if he wants it. \"I'm here to love you,\" he sings, to god, to a lost love, to all of the above. \"That's the happiness I pursue.\" "}
