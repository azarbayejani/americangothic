And, on the band's third album, Wild Yams, Westie and co. turn in an eclectic set of the sort of indie rock you'd expect from the Pavement camp: sturdy songwriting, loose playing, catchy melodies, and smartass posturing. West makes for an interesting frontman. Though he never strains for the poetic opacity of Malkmus' lyrics, his effortless vocal delivery exudes the same oblivious confidence, like a hungover college kid who rolls out of bed to ace the final without cracking a book. Yeah, okay, so maybe he doesn't ace the test, exactly. But there's so much comedy in these songs, the guy deserves a little mercy on grading day. In \"Diary of a Stone Mason\", he hilariously scats before crooning, \"In the darkness, I rock out/ And angels cry.\" On the midtempo divorce song, \"I Could Drink an Ocean\", he paints the scene with, \"I took my fist and punched it through the wall/ You grabbed the kids and drove them to the mall.\" And on \"Fag & Ah Light\", there's Westie at the pearly gates, sweating St. Peter's judgment (\"Oh, no! My sins!/ Will I get in?\") atop bouncy vintage keys. But if listeners can count on West's deadpan approach to silliness (and yep, they can), Marble Valley's music is a bit less predictable: One minute the band might take cues from heavy metal (\"Dirty\"), and the next they might be exploring the propulsive glories of motorik (\"Sunshine Rayland\"). Yet throughout Wild Yams, there remains one constant source of pleasure: terrible synths. Check \"Computer Man\", on which West pulls out a strikingly Les Savy Favlike lyric (\"Everybody sad about tragedy, tragedy!/ Everybody talk about CPU capacity!\"), before a Kraftwerkish analog synth line blossoms at the chorus. (Let's see if we can't all do our part to make the future sound this much like the late 70s.) Wild Yams isn't going to change any lives, but when West croons about getting high in his dreams and playing a gig in a UFO on \"Eric the Viking\", you might get a laugh out of it. And that's not a bad thing, considering this shit makes angels cry.  "}
