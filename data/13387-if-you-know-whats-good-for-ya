{"label":" DFA / Rong","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/14394/homepage_large.f3f4bc80.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andrew Gaerig","artist":"Woolfy","title":"If You Know What's Good for Ya!!","text":" Since joining hands with bigbrotherinarms DFA Records, San Franciscobased Rong Music has increasingly coopted the sly branding of their (recently, perplexingly quiet) partner, rereleasing their Notwave compilation and issuing a collection of !!!offshoot Free Blood's singles. Electropopper Woolfy comes in for the theoretically profileraising comp treatment next, as If You Know What's Good For Ya!! snaps up a handful of the singles they've released since 2005 and pairs them with fresh material. The result is a neat compendium of many of the decade's electronicpop trends, from digestible funkpunk to spacedout disco.Lead single \"Oh Missy\" (which appeared as early as 2005 as an Aside, was remixed on a label comp in 2007, and was again released as a 12\" earlier this year, presumably to prep for If You Know) borrows DFA's oldest, and best, trick: Trojan Horseing in a great pop number under the guise of a dance track. Slated second here, Woolfy wastes no time introducing listeners to what remains his best song: speedy congos, serrated, upsmacked guitar chords, and, as Woolfy's bigfloor vocals drop, thwumping bass. \"I'll tell you what's wrong/ If it makes you see the whole half of it\", he declares with the confidence of man who is actually saying something. As a preening takedown of a rogue babe, \"Oh Missy\" touches on (without getting too wild) late70s popdisco Stones.If You Know rarely reaches \"Oh Missy\"'s heights again, but there's plenty to like: the quickfinger guitar strut of \"Odyssey\" and the hardscrabble electropunk of \"The Warehouse\" (both previously released) retain their sense of craftsmanship and their nervy hooks. \"Looking Glass\" is the obvious breakout candidate among the new tracks, with a big, infectious synthpop groove and Woolfy's shouty, processed verses leading to a soft, stuttered chorus: \"Don't/ Take/ Your/ Eyes/ Off me.\" \"Sonic Monday\" is a drizzly, undeniably British ballad, developing slowly as swaths of digitized noise patter about; it's saccharine and weightless in the way Bernard Sumner's slower moments were.Woolfy's pop instincts remain mostly on point, though the Lindstr√∏mlite of \"Loa the Disco\" is undercooked and \"Pink Champagne\" (the final original composition before the remixes) is either drearily heavyhanded or a fitting \"the drugs don't work\"style salve depending on your tolerance for weepy closers. The remixes Carlos Hernandez's loungey take on \"Two Far Gone\" and Lee Douglas' lightening of \"The Warehouse\" serve only to move If You Know from a manageable 45 minutes to more than an hour in length.It's fine, though, that If You Know arrives with blemishes; nothing about Woolfy's track record suggested a coherent, workable, fulllength was in the cards. If You Know is a bit perplexing if we're collecting, why not collect all of the mixes? but ultimately a useful tool for putting to bed Woolfy's past while eyeing his future. "}
