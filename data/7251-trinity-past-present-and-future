{"label":" Capitol","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/7139/homepage_large.28c5e5f3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Sam Chennault","artist":"Slum Village","title":"Trinity: Past, Present and Future","text":" Most know the score on Slum Village: they have great production, but their mic skills need to show some serious improving. On their previous effort, Fantastic Vol 2, producer Jay Dee laid down some nice tracks, but his flows, along with those of fellow SV emcees T3 and Baatin, lacked any vitality, focus or energy. Apparently, Jay Dilla, who has also provided production work for A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul, heard the criticism and stepped away from the group, ostensibly citing that he was tired of touring. For Trinity, Slum Village have enlisted emcee Elzhi to assume Jay's mic duties while largely relying upon T3 to take over the boards. For most, the question wasn't \"will they succeed?\" but \"how can they possibly?\" Their first single, \"Tainted\", finds Slum Village returning to familiar territory. With a chill vibe and harmonious R&B; crooning, it's more than a little reminiscent of Fantastic's \"Players\". The lyrics are clich√©d but forgivable, and although the emcees' flows are nothing memorable, they aren't obtrusive, either. Off the relative strength of that single, one might suppose that Slum Village has managed to survive the departure of their most talented member. Unfortunately, \"Tainted\" is one of the few bright spots on a very mediocre album. After a few tracks, it becomes increasingly more difficult to ignore the pathetic lyrics and boring flows even the production seems redundant, bland, and horribly imitative and regressive. In the song \"Disco\", the Slum Village emcees manage to fill three minutes with complete lyrical nonsense: \"Thug ass niggas want to disco,\" declares the chorus. Um, no. To paraphrase Chuck D, hiphop was created 'cuz we never dug disco. \"Unisex\" sounds like a throwaway Neptunes beat with a weak freestyle pushed way down in the mix. Like many songs on this overstuffed 22song clunker, it has no business seeing the light of day. Fortunately, Jay Dilla does return for three tracks. While those, along with the instrumental closer \"Fallin' in Love\", do showcase some really smooth production, it's a case of too little, too late. By this point, the album has choked on its own sour cocktail of muddled flows, mediocre beats and cheap imitations. While Trinity may not be the worst album of the year, it is one that will be forgotten very, very quickly. "}
