{"label":" F5","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/10895/homepage_large.b115830b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ben Westhoff","artist":"Hi-Fidel and DJ Crucial","title":"The Company of Wolves","text":"  Besides rapping for a stellar, relatively unknown St. Louis record label, L.A. resident Umar Rashid is a tshirt designer, painter, and the author of a graphic novel for children, The Hunter and the Teardrop. According to a description, the book is \"a moral tale about an interstellar hunter who kills all the great beasts in the universe, and one day finds he has nothing left to kill.\" Rashid's nom de hippityhop is HiFidel, and his second album is not really what you'd expect from a West Coast renaissance dude. Entitled The Company of Wolves, it tells the tales of sadsack characters plucked from the swampy muck of his imagination. As he explains on \"Barbara Kruger\": \"These are people that I've never known/ But I'm pretty sure they're out there/ Hope your cover's not blown.\" Some are alcoholics, some are crackheads, nearly all are depressed, and the government and big corporations are just making things worse. The antihero in \"The Thin Wall\" is headed off to Iraq: \"And he realizes when the man on the TV screen fumbles/ It's just a game/ And in real life everything crumbles.\" \"Jimmy\"'s title character, meanwhile, may have issues, but he takes solace knowing he's not as bad as \"that crazy president who killed them babies/ Or that prime minister that slaughtered those ladies.\" The tone is quite different from Fidel's 2002 debut, Traveling Between St. Louis And Chicago, in which the cynicism was tempered by a hopeful enthusiasm. But it's not just Fidel who has changed; equally responsible for Wolves' death march feel is DJ Crucial, who produced both albums. Traveling's looser, more energetic setting was fitting for one of the Midwest's great acidrocksampling DJs, but here Crucial has largely forsaken scratching and singalongs in favor of flutes and jazzinfluenced noir beats. We're left without a song to rock out to, or even a headnodder like Traveling's masterpiece, \"Tenth Wonderful\".  But there's a Bukowskian beauty in all this pain, and even a few laughs. \"Gordo 3003\" borrows Dr. Octagon's twinkling spaceage bleeps and imagery, down to the \"iguanalike reptiles armed with projectiles, crisscrossing the night sky like African textiles.\" Fidel is nonetheless better served when he leaves the goofy surrealism to collaborator Serengeti, who raps on \"Party Farmington\" about a cougar who seduces young men while her man is working at a weapons factory in the suburbs. (\"We spoke about steroids, and her husband's bed wetting.\") Serengeti is joined on the album by other underground ringers including recent Om: Hip Hop signee Black Spade, L.A.'s Pigeon John, and St. Louis' Mathias, the latter two of whom are responsible for the album's single uplifting track, \"Small Victories\". The pair reportedly had a tough time convincing Fidel to record this hopeful song, but it nonetheless inspired him to deliver his most impassioned verse on the album, one which may also offer a clue as to his evolving mindset: \"I know there'll be brighter days ahead but for now/ I gotta stay fit and maintain my style.\"  "}
