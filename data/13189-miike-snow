Timbaland's Shock Value sold more than a milli, nothing to sneeze Creatine at, but its distillation of the hiphop heavyweight's scifi primitivism still sounds more like a victory lap than an actual victory. Swizz Beatz had at least one solid artist album in him, but he's no rapper, as the wait for a followup underscores. And N.E.R.D.? Um, you've heard those guys' other stuff, right? Pop's biggest producertoartist success stories, such as Kanye West, have become exceptions thanks in part to their outsize personalities.That's where Miike Snow start to fall short. And not just because they briefly cloaked themselves in the whole \"ooh we're anonymous, who could we be?\" promotional trend that's been sweeping the blogs. True, you expect good things from Swedish producers Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg, who as Bloodshy & Avant produced Britney Spear's indiekidconverting 2004 single \"Toxic\", among other tracks for the likes of Spears, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Rachel Stevens, and Sugababes. But Scandinavia's recent indiepop leadership notwithstanding, \"Swedish producers\" doesn't exactly scream \"would be interesting to hear by themselves at albumlength.\" Enter Downtown Recordings production regular Andrew Wyatt, of anthemic New York electrorockers Fires of Rome (and previously of Black Beetle, with Jeff Buckley cohorts Joan Wasser and Michael Tighe).Miike Snow is about as exciting as all those biographical details would indicate. The debut album by these producersturnedtrio comes after blogbait remixes galore, including a nice enough Postal Serviceish Vampire Weekend makeover, but there's little of those fine young Columbians' infectious exuberance here. Biggest surprise? Miike Snow largely trade in brash pop immediacy for lowkey, pianoladen melancholy. Decent bummer of a first single \"Burial\", with its fluttery synths, tricky rhythms, and a couple of those vaguely exotic yelps currently de riguer in commercials for limeflavored beer, is sort of like crying your eyes out to Phil Collins on a beach. Also like that, it's a bit nonsensical: \"This empathy is overrated/ Like a snapshot when you've lost the game.\" Stop overrating those snapshots, people! The sunny West Coast harmonies of \"Faker\" and the oceanic calmness of \"Sans Soleil\" similarly suffice without quite standing out.Miike Snow are better when they're more starletready, though even then they could use an actual starlet. The thickly textured buzzstrut of \"Plastic Jungle\" is pretty close to Britney's \"Womanizer\", but instead of femmebot purrs there's a whispery guy who wants to \"get slain.\" Whether in the kiddiepop lilt of opener \"Animal\", the Fieldminding hypnotism of \"In Search Of\", or the glimmering electrohouse thump of \"Silvia\" and the yearning \"A Horse Is Not a Home\" (no, not even in this realestate market), the disc is rarely less than professionalgrade. Faint praise, sigh.So Miike Snow aren't half as potentially infuriating as a Kanye or a Timbaland, but they aren't half as lovable, either. More promisingly, the album's \"Black & Blue\" splits the difference between Prince and pianopop, only to underwhelm as a whole. The best track, the one with the Dirty Projectorslike flickering guitars, perfect for summer driving mixes: \"Song for No One\". Hello, is it me you're looking for? "}
