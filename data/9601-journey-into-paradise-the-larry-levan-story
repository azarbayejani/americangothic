How can you do justice to a man who seemed to exemplify so much?Journey Into Paradise: The Larry Levan Story attempts something a bit humbler than that: Torn between documenting Levan's production nous and his good taste, this 2xCD compilation haphazardly intermingles tracks produced or remixed by Levan with tracks he simply liked to play the most common thread throughout is Rhino's heavy reliance on its parentlabel Warner's back catalog. Whatever its provenance, the upshot of this approach is an an unmatchable concentration of musical brilliance the \"Story,\" if there is one, is ultimately about the music rather than the man.Journey Into Paradise is a snapshot of disco as it was transforming into other sounds and styles that would carry the torch for hedonistic dancefloor grooves (jazzfunk, r&b, synthpop), although the compilers also pay tribute to disco's mixedup, stylistically ambiguous final chapters with a handful of wellplaced inclusions, from the glassy synthpop of Yazoo's \"Situation\" to the iridescent flashes of Talking Heads' \"Once in a Lifetime\". Likewise, there are a handful of dreamy, bleary moments to satisfy the Disco (Not Disco) enthusiasts, such as the unsteady stoner drift of Mann Friday's \"Love Honey, Love Heartache\". It's ultimately to the compilers' credit that they resist the temptation to turn this into yet another hypereclectic celebration of the elasticity of the term \"disco,\" instead concentrating on framing a \"Levan sound\" that is crisp, energetic, and relatively classicist bigchested divas, pounding pianos, chickenscratch guitar, grand strings, and choirs of backing vocalists, all confidently asserting that the road to paradise is paved with bigbudget professionalism and auditoriumfilling dynamics.  The trick of Levan's style as represented here is to allude to both mainstream and underground disco while avoiding being either: Despite the music's grandiosity and largesse, it never veers toward excessive slickness or formalism. The grooves are raw and spontaneous, but whereas modern orthodoxy tells us that this requires stripping back, Levan and likeminded producers achieved the same result by piling it on: Check how the heady bustle of Phreek's \"Weekend\" builds without ever climaxing, its enormous multitiered orchestration a riot of noise, yet in perfect synchronicity. This is bright, vivid music, almost painfully sharp in its hyperalert, meticulous, restless density, but it's the overload of detail that leaves you hypnotized lost in the music, as Sister Sledge put it.  Torn between extroverted songfulness and space exploration, many tracks simply choose both: Levan's 10minute remix of Inner Life's cover of \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" moves from a relatively faithful, celebratory rendition of the standard into an orgy of shrieking strings, clattering percussion and shrill diva exhortations. Conversely, Patrice Rushen's \"Haven't You Heard\" is simple but utterly perfect: A sweet love song that doubles as an explosion of fierce joy, its ecstatic piano is a deathless pop hook that simultaneously foreshadows the ecstasytriggers of early house music.  It's possible that there is disco that is more camp, more epic, more woozy, more soulful, more physical, more strident, or more perverse than that which is collected here, but certainly not all at once. In this, Journey Into Paradise feels like a conscious attempt to portray disco at its most disco, disco in its best possible light; you'll be hardpressed to find a compilation that offers so noble a vision.
