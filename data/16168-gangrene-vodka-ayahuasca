But tracing their lineage back through last year's Roc Marciano collaboration Greneberg and 2010's Gutter Water brings up a stillrecent origin point in the Alchemist's 2009 allstar blowout, Chemical Warfare. The precedent for the collaboration between Alchemist and fellow producerslashMC Oh No was strongly established on cuts like \"Acts of Violence\" and \"Under Siege\", a couple of cartoonishly sinister tracks that pushed indie/street crossover rawness into a nofucksgiven irreverence about how raw it actually was. If you want a quickanddirty idea of what kind of flag they planted, take into account that their equivalent of a funnywigs \"Sabotage\" video was footage of them doing violent slapstick spliced into newscast tapes of the Rodney King riots. So why does it feel like they've been around longer? Besides the fact that Alchemist and Oh No are veteran presences on their own the \"We Gonna Make It\" producer meets the \"Supermagic\" producer would be a fascinatingenough oddcouple pitch there's been a lot of conceptual forward momentum at work in their last twoandahalf years. If Gutter Water  dragged the grimier tendencies of underground hiphop through a dysenteryinfected toilet party and Greneberg was Marcberg's weirdly invigorating hangover, then Vodka & Ayahuasca is a stab at drunkpsych nightmarishness that runs on slasherflick suspense. Throw in a bit of weirdo grossout comedy the intro track has one of the nastiest clips of someone puking I've ever heard on record and you've got a good indication of a couple of artists trying to outdo themselves in the outrageousness department. How much they succeed rests on how well these two fuse their production styles, and Alchemist's knack with stonerfriendly, vaguely arenarockish loops, recently exhibited at its best on Curren$y's Covert Coup, slots in well with Oh No's affinity for agecaked lofi detritus of obscure origin. Dirtysounding guitars slash through \"Gladiator Music\", \"Dark Shades\", and \"Drink Up\", and with their churning riffs draining the cathartic payoff out of their old acidrock contexts, what's left is a scraping, growling squall. Pianos and synthesizers are dragged shuddering out from the basement and worked into nervetwisting loops, giving \"Top Instructors\" and \"The Groove\" a forceful tension. Basslines and breaks stay heavy and crisp, even through the most weededout doomtempo trudges, while \"Flame Throwers\" and \"Odds Cracked\" in particular have enough bounce in them to keep a fronttoback listen from getting bogged down in murk. That atmosphere helps hold up Vodka & Ayahuasca's sense of anarchic, alteredstate unease when the lyrics don't quite cut it, though the tolerableatworst punchlines and metaphors are easier to stomach the less deadserious you take them. Alchemist's badgering flow is selfassured and selfaware enough to give even his clunkiest lines an \"I meant to do that\" affability, turning his Marmaduke namedrops and organtrafficking threats from corny to actuallykindafunny. (It helps that when he's on, he's on, his painthuffer odyssey on \"Auralac Bags\" in particular.) Oh No's technique is standardissue Left Coast abstraction, prone to its share of attentiongetting moments for internalrhyme wonks, and when he takes the reins there's some tightlywound phraseology to dissect. But the most memorable lines either come from guest spots Kool G Rap and Roc Marciano flatout repossess \"Gladiator Music\" and \"Drink Up\" respectively or the foundsound clips about hallucinogen freakouts and belligerent arrestees that provide the most unhinged moments. No matter if Vodka & Ayahuasca is worth listening to, it's not an easy equation of lyrics versus beats. What's crucial is that it feels like an albumlength distillation of that moment in a horror movie where the suddenness of a character's death is overtaken by how exaggeratedly gruesome the aftermath is.
