He takes a similar approach to his new project as he did his old band, adding dark lyrics and complex emotions to the pop of the fifties. But where the Rock*A*Teens played an artful, echoladen take on rockabilly, Tenement Halls takes traditional pop and plays it through a murky wall of sound.Knitting Needles and Bicycle Bells builds distinctive walls of instrumentation, mostly from organs, pianos, and guitars. But rather than an inimitable Spectorlike sound, where every instrument can be clearly heard, Knitting Needles is muddy. Organs and pianos drone on, and guitars escape from the mire now and then, but it's an impenetrable pastiche of instruments that needs Lopez's voice to pull them out. I think there's some sweeping cello work under the jangling guitars of \"Charlemagne\", but I can't quite tell. That's probably a guitar being plucked in \"Marry Me\", but I can't get past the keyboard effect that sounds like dentist's drill, not to mention one of Knitting Needles whiniest vocal performances. The simple, swaying chord changes are clamoring for a voice to belt out a melody and carry them forward. Lopez wails, begs, and hollers hoarsely at the top of his range, but he never quite sings. Perhaps more sparse instrumentation would have suited Lopez' romantic melodies. The speedy skip of \"Plenty Is Never Enough\" gets by on just acoustic guitar and a few pounded keys, and it's one of the album's more tolerable songs. If you're stalwart enough to have made it this far into the disc, you still have to deal with \"Marry Me\", and that's enough to send anyone over the nearest bridge even before hearing the toypiano plink of \"When the Swifts Come Home\" or the swinging church bell singalong \"Wicked Wicked Ways\". Lyrically, Lopez sounds like a defeated man. No matter how perky opener \"Silver from the Silt\" sounds, it's weighed down by the repetition of \"Just quit, just quit, it's the best you will find down\", full of resignation. \"Now She Knows\" spits disillusionment through it's muddy meandering, with lines like \"All that glitters isn't gold/ It's just shimmering paint on a castiron saint/ A scotchsucking brute in a Brooks Brothers suit\", a quirky bit of antiquated bile. Lopez likely has more perspective these days, and he's brave for starting over in the face of relative apathy towards his old band, but as the lone player and producer here, he could still use some guidance and maybe another set of ears.
