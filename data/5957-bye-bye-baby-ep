{"label":" Ok Go","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13547/homepage_large.f5893d20.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brent DiCrescenzo","artist":"OK Go","title":"Bye Bye Baby EP","text":" Reverse the pronunciation guide for \"INXS.\" That's \"okay, go,\" not \"oakgoo.\" \"OKGO\" sounds more like a HeMan villain, and therefore seems more suitable as a name for a mathrock band. Ok Go have been masterfully collecting hype by plastering their flashy posters on Exito! newspaper dispensers and opening for every single band in Chicago over the last year, including Don Caballero, The Promise Ring, Elliott Smith, and OMD. (Yes, Orchestral Maneuvers in the Dark.) It's actually been fascinating to watch their inevitable rise. Local press now invariably strokes the band's egos; in a city still sadly yearning for their next \"Pumpkins,\" these guys seem to have become the prime candidates. Image counts, kids, and a flashy www.okgo.net website with press photos was born even before these guys had oh, right! a record. But now that their meticulous, yearlong recording sessions can finally be heard, however briefly, the band can get on with gathering devoted fans and lukewarm reviews. This sub10minute EP was crafted in five studios, including the spiffy workplaces of Dave Trumfio, Steve Albini, and Butch Vig. (At this point, it should be noted that Ok Go have trust funds.) And despite minor songwriting triumphs, it can be difficult to wrap your head around the fact that five studios, two producers, and five assistants worked to create a Weezer knockoff called \"Bye Bye Baby\". On stage, Ok Go play the shiniest gear, filtered through electronics and a laptop. The silicon sound offers pinches tiny pinches of Brainiac moments, most notably on their tune, \"This Is Not the Sound of a Train\". Sadly, that's not included here. Instead, we get the lithe acoustic throwaway \"It's Tough to Have a Crush When the Boy Doesn't Feel the Same Way You Do\". Jeremy Jacobsen of Five Style and The Lonesome Organist, and The Coctails' Mark Greenberg supply some nifty vaudevillian twinkling underneath, but it fails to detract from the fact that everything the song has to offer is handed over in the title alone. Quick, guess the chorus! Reading the sleeve can be just as melodic, and at least saves you from the line, \"Who ever knew such hullabaloo?\" \"We Dug a Hole\" opens with \"Strawberry Fields\" organ and hides pleasant choruses. However, the verses serve up layers of \"loops\" and \"rapping\" that could only make Amy Heckerling wet, and their anal studio attention dominates every guitar chug and vocal harmony. Of course, considering the competition, Ok Go have a brilliant future. Even this beats the living lisp out of The Promise Ring. (Oddly, Jade Tree turned Ok Go down this could have been their retirement fund.) Still, the band fully embraces the cheddar pleasures of major label pop, and for every crispy curveball thrown, there's a lyric like, \"CCCCinnamon lips and candy kisses on my tongue.\" And if these sound like bitter, grizzled complaints, it's only because I'm trying to brace you for the moment they ditch selfreleased CDs and come to your town with FruitbytheFoot's Generation Flav'R Fest.
