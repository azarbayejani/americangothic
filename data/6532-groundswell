It turns out a brief trip back into 2003 reveals all there is to know about Parts & Labor: Prior to that split CD, they issued a single album of their own, Grounswell, and taken together, the two releases give a pretty good picture of a band rapidly maturing and developing a singular sound. The New York trio's half of Rise, Rise, Rise found them playing dronecentered instrumentals that had the effect of mimicking hurdygurdys and bagpipes, as well as balancing their electronic noise tendencies with melodic development, and even a quick pass through Groundswell displays the groundwork that they were building off of. The band's noisier tendencies tend to be less regulated and the compositions less streamlined, but the basic mix of pummeling percussion, frequently distorted bass and squelching electronics feels like a natural precedent for what came after. This record's overall sound is extremely bright from the massive lowend to the buzzing treble leaping from the speakers although Parts & Labor don't seem interested so much in establishing a mood as in punching you in the face (like Lightning Bolt, only slightly less akin to dental surgery). Keyboardist/electronics manipulator Dan Friel creates dense, aggressive textures with what sound like simple tone generators and oscillators, a la Silver Apples' Simeon, and the rhythm section then has their way with them, carrying the squealing cloud of melting drones that open \"Happy New Year\" on an epic ride through fouronthefloor passages smothered in Jim Sykes' octopedal drum fills, halftime crawls and ecstatic crescendos. \"Parts & Labor\" staggers over queasy oscillation before launching into an alternate dimension surf tidal wave somewhat reminiscent of Disco Inferno's \"In Sharky Water\" in its third minute, BJ Warshaw's bass slapping around the reverb chamber like Dick Dale in an especially foul mood. For all their experimental and confrontational tendencies, though, Parts & Labor do occasionally see fit to just rock the fuck out, and the towering fuzz bass riff and thundering drums of \"TB Strut\" do the job nicely, while the textural mix of overdriven bass and oscillating electronics that carry the low end of \"Mike Burke for President\" are almost as hipshaking as they are earthquaking. Parts & Labor still show room for improvement on their debut, and they've already hinted at how they'll make those strides on Rise, Rise, Rise, but it's still a sharp salutation from a band that seems capable of creating some incredible mayhem.
