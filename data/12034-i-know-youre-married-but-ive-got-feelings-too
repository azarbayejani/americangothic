She favors melodic, arty, periodically driving midtempo piano rock that shares obvious stylistic kinship with the likes of Tori Amos and Kate Bush. As the daughter of famed folk songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, her lyrics perhaps predictably reflect a lifestyle of tweedybohemian cultural privilege, laden with references to farmhouses, Captain Beefheart, and the BBC, and frequently seeming to chronicle relationships with surprise other artists and songwriters.Almost the entire thrill of Wainwright's music is tied up in her vocal performance, which of course is something that's been said at times about Amos and Bush as well. The second best thing about I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too may be its title, but the absolute best is the way Wainwright attacks so many of these songs, transforming lyrics that might otherwise be faintly ridiculous into vital testaments, taking music that's mostly MOR and wringing from it a startling wealth of shiverinducing moments.Wainwright has no boundaries and no shame when it comes to her delivery, and hence it's inevitable some listeners will find her squeals and moans and unusual phrasing unbearably florid and perhaps even comical. Yet the popularity of a guy like Antony Hegarty suggests many of you don't always demand plainspoken grit from your singers, so hopefully you too can be mesmerized by how Wainwright adds druggy, Lethelike connotations to her pronunciation of the word \"river\" on the operatic, austere \"Niger River\", or the teasing way she stretches words on \"Jesus and Mary\", giving us something that sounds like \"I'll keep you aroundhahownd/ This dirty old townhahown.\"Even bigger chills come when the music's intensity actually matches Wainwright's. \"You Cheated Me\" carries a tightly springloaded chorus that belies her musical debt to Fleetwood Mac, and Wainwright is every bit its match, cramming her lines with all the filigrees and exhortations they can hold. \"Comin' Tonight\" is messier and even better, Wainwright bleating, \"I could steal a melody\" with openthroated abandon before descending into such incomprehensible emoting that it's clear melody is actually the furthest thing from her mind. In fact, understanding or even making out the words on Wainwright's best songs is largely ancillary this kind of concentrated, spinetingling fervor doesn't really require context.Wainwright does lean pretty heavily on this formula of mild, occasionally rocky folkpop doused with generous measures of vocal swooping and diving. And admittedly it can be somewhat wearying to try and consume the record in one sitting, especially by the time you get to the wailing \"So Many Friends\" or the arch, gothic \"In the Middle of the Night\". The album's arrangements do go a long way towards mitigating this exhaustion in the case of an artist like Wainwright, \"tasteful\" need not be a pejorative, not when the dusty drum rolls and taut guitar thrum of \"Hearts Club Band\" offer their own kind of drama, bereft of histrionics for a change.Of course, histrionics remain Wainwright's bread and butter, and they don't come much more cathartic and hairraising than the unexpected dam bursts of \"Jimi\". The verses tease our ghoulish interest with their passing reference to Wainwright's famous dad, but it's the straightforward simplicity of the chorus that really compels, as Wainwright bears down and rides the music's rising squall to declaim, \"It takes up so much time/ And it makes up for nothing\" with a passion and purpose that seem for a moment to overwhelm even her love of precious language and vocal virtuosity.
