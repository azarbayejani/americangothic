{"label":" Somia","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/2037/homepage_large.7a629dde.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Cameron Macdonald","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Miad","text":" Somia Music is the latest upandcoming label in the Miami IDM syndicate whose affiliates also include Schematic, Beta Bodega, and Rice & Beans. Miad, its compilation of predominately Miami artists, succeeds as a solid primer to a fertile scene, yet much of its music is so derivative that regional significance is rather moot it could've been mistaken for either an international compilation or a bootleg of Kid606 and AFX Bsides. Regionalism has never much mattered to music whose software is the same regardless of locale, but increasingly generic elements are in full effect here: tweaked frequencies, drum machines falling down 20 flights of stairs, microtones and vocals timestretched to a drill, and kiddieNintendo melodies ironically superimposed on hiphop and jungle beats all schtupedup before getting too placid. Fortunately, most of the tracks still amuse.Miad opens with the brief, digital rainfall of Duster's \"Intro\", which drifts asleep and forgets its name by the time Captain Marmalade's \"Finding Out That You're in Love in the Seventh Grade\" kicks in, pitting a struggling novice drummer with a sweetened synth ballad. The momentum picks up with Clapan's \"Shopping Cart Rmx\", which employs the same synth patch but chirps along to a classic Miami bass jaunt while Osiris takes such jeep beats to their selfimmolating logic. Xanopticon turns out crackaddled jungle on \"Retrn\", inviting Venetian Snares to a gentlemen's duel a good show that leaves only a few droplets of blood on the floor. Meggablockx, meanwhile, baffles with \"Angel\", a downtempo ballad garnished with a synthpop hook reminiscent of the Reading Rainbow theme, accompanied by snippets of what seems to be a LSDlaced bride reciting her vows at a newage wedding. Subjex's \"Subslaughter\" is fine, coagulated glitchhop, while his remix of Phoenecia's \"Can Recall\" is spiced with moribund jungle beats and demonic crickets that hide in the bushes outside your house. However, Cliquetpar is the standout with \"Elico in the Sea\", featuring Childisc's Elico Suzuki enjoying choral orgasms over stoopid, algorithmabusing drill 'n' bass.Miad's major misfires come with Beatwife's \"Random Bass Pach\", which seems to be a retitled Richard D. James Album outtake, and Duster's \"Outro\", which is absolute filler, a 19minute interval of silence before blurting a snippet from a deathmetal demo tape. 'Tis a fine moment's grace of ironic pluck, but pretending to enjoy this piece to demonstrate your hipster credentials might lose you friends. Now this is subversion. Welcome aboard, Somia. "}
