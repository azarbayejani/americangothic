For Mando Diao, Ode to Ochrasy predictably marks the point where these Swedish garagerockers trade in their leathers for Nehru jackets, and tidy up the studentsquat squalor of 2004's Hurricane Bar with some incense and expensivelooking import rugs. But as evolutions go, Ode to Ochrasy makes for a particularly awkward adolescent phase, the sound of a band that is outgrowing their loudfastrules roots but still too timid to sever them completely. Ode to Ochrasy's disjointed nature is reinforced by the fact that, with few exceptions, its tracklist segregates the band's two principal songwriters, Bj√∂rn Dixgard (the one who sounds like Noel) and Gustaf Noren (the one who sounds like Liam), to separate sides, making it feel like two albums. Side one belongs mostly to Dixgard, who seems determined to both preserve Mando Diao's ScandoLibertines rep and subvert it a relationship that ultimately proves irreconcilable and produces the album's most illadvised turns. With its \"Heart Full of Soul\" fuzz riff and Jacques Brelinspired imagery, \"Amsterdam\" signals a pronounced shift in the band's direction, but its attempts at evocative narrative are undermined by wouldbe clever lines that fall flat (\"When I came to in Amsterdam, the hotel showed a movie/ with Marlon Brando and his friend Paciiiinooo\" why not just say you watched The Godfather?) and a wannabe profound chorus (\"I talked to god on the telephone/ But I really can't tell you what he told me but he was alive\") that confuses the meaningless for meaningful. And though \"Good Morning, Herr Horst\" and \"Long Before Rock 'n' Roll\" provide swift, skifflepunk kicks, momentum is stalled by buzzkill ballad \"Josephine\", while the acoustic title track seems emblematic of the album's wayward ambitions: a populist lifeduringwartime lament framed around a madeup fantasy world of the singer's own design and comprehension. So it's with considerable relief that Noren appears midalbum with \"Morning Paper Dirt\", a powerpop pickmeup that serves as a fitting companion piece to his Hurricane Bar standout \"Annie's Angle\", and effectively signals his seizure of the album's reins. Though guilty of faceless studentdisco fodder (\"TV & Me\") and the odd lyrical clunker (\"I woke up on your kitchen floor with a headache made in hell\"), Noren proffers a more agreeable evolution for Mando Diao's modrock by upping the Hammondorgan soul quotient and toning down the punk fuzz for a loose jangle: \"Song for Aberdeen\" and \"The Wildfire (If It Was True)\" are spirited, spilledpint communions that suggest early E Street Band more than the band's usual Anglo influences. And with orchestroballad \"The New Boy\", he shows other retrominded rockers that there is a future beyond rewriting the Beatles that is, rewriting solo Lennon. In the lawless terrain of rock'n'roll, sometimes the best move forward is not the most challenging one, but the most obvious one. "}
