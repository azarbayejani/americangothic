From a distance, Beam's lofi compositions sounded like a Harry Smith field recording plucked away by Nick Drake with Crosby, Stills & Nash on backup. But close up it was all about the poetry: concrete, ambiguous, and laced with tender irony. Since Beam compares himself to J.J. Cale, and I'd even compare his lyrical style to Beck's Apollinairegrade symbolism on Mutations, maybe it's not so weird that he's on Nirvana's label after all. \"I think I work with the visual a lot when I write,\" the parttime musician and fulltime Miami film teacher once said. And The Creek Drank the Cradle was unabashedly concrete, studded with disarming pickup lines like, \"The water's there to warm you/ And the earth is warmer/ When you laugh,\" and, \"Needlework and seedlings/ In the way you're walking.\" Its songs also sank into little moments still warm with loss small enough to get inside you, but general enough to fill you with an afterthefact numbness recognizable as love. Mothers lost sons, daughters lost fathers, lovers lost love, and each song somehow contained a bit of each. Strikingly, the singers on The Creek Drank the Cradle keep losing their religion, too: outgrowing the bonds of belief, losing their fear of the Lord, letting their mothers' bibles burn. One of them even looks back to see a longextinct love as a kind of unrecoverable faith: \"Found your rosary broken to pieces/ Every night by the bed you'd kiss the beads.\" Still, the crucifixion is the greatest myth of loss we have, and it's no shock that a lyricist soaked in southern allegory should adapt it for his own purposes. There's even a defiantly unChristian ring to resurrection oneliners like, \"Frozen, the ground refused to die/ And the guitar rose again.\" But while the textures, tempos, and diction of the five short songs on The Sea & The Rhythm EP are consistent with what Iron & Wine has been and probably will always be the theme of loss has itself gone. In its place, Beam pushes trembling expectation, ecstatic abandon, and plainfaced repentance. Now, not one of these faded songs screams oldtime religion, but it seems fair to wonder if there is a little revival going on here. \"Beneath the Balcony\" is a loping folk ballad telling the grim story of a warrior reduced to begging while some kids wait out a storm and \"make sure the king won't grant the dead man one more day.\" At this point, it's an ambiguous parable with a cryptoChristian vibe worthy of C.S. Lewis. But when the Mother Mary appears begging with Christ on her lap, there's no question we're dealing with a gospel story. The song ends with a kid crouched behind a garbage can \"who waits for the king to come/ And holds his sweating hand.\" Salvation, anyone? The supersweet title track, a hymn to sensual connection, is driven by its rare presenttense setting, but still sags. It draws its force from an ambiguity (is the \"we\" here lover/lover or mother/infant?) all a little too cheaply bought by comeons like, \"The milk from your breast is on my lips.\" Maybe the singer gets off by playing baby Jesus with grown women. Or maybe I just had to get a Jesus reference in for every song. At least I won't have to try for the last two. The next track is a parable of sin and redemption masquerading as a nursery rhyme. Some Mexican kid called, you guessed it, Jesus was born in a truck on the fourth of July. A mobile manger for an American nativity scene. With fireworks blooming above like a star in the East, this selfless little immigrant gives the singer the best playing card in his grubby little deck. Such a pure act opens a space for Beam's trademark muffled irony, the kind of brutal understatement common on the LP but up to now absent on this EP: \"He never wanted nothing I remember/ Maybe a broken bottle if I had two.\" Jesus covers for the singer, lets him break a fivedollar bet, and generally assumes his sins. Then, in an oddly specific twist, when the singer succumbs to temptation by secretly eloping to Vegas with Jesus' sister, the beatific childgod is there to greet them: \"Naked, the Judas in me/ Fell by the tracks but he lifted me high/ Kissing my head like a brother and never asking why.\" Unmistakably salvific. The last track goes down easy but is extremely hard to digest. \"Someday the Waves\" opens with a man waking at dawn to look down on his lover's face in wonder. The chorus seems like a sober display of faithfulness (\"You pick a place that's where I'll be\") until some cryptic and perverse forbearance slips in, Matthewstyle: \"Time, like your cheek, has turned for me.\" This could mean a number of things: the singer is marking time by his sleeping lover's tossing and turning; the lover's pallid complexion means the singer is running out of time; or, as the lover has patiently taken a beating, the singer has simply gotten older. The next verse promises a pieinthesky day of redemption when \"every aching old machine will feel no pain,\" but neglects to follow through with a credible image of relief. It's the last verse that adds an oddly appropriate twist: \"Waking before you I'm like the Lord/ Who sees his love though we don't know.\" Sure, it's a simile, but if you think about it, Sam Beam would make a great Holy Spirit. With a fulllength album out by next Easter, he's got this Jew's vote for American Jesus in 2004. "}
