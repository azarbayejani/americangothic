{"label":" Rhino","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/10825/homepage_large.3252be3b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brandon Stosuy","artist":"Various Artists","title":"The Heavy Metal Box","text":" The Heavy Metal Box's biggest draw is its awesomely kitsch packaging: Going allout on presentation, the four discs and fullcolor booklet (liner notes, interviews, photos) are packed vertically inside a recreation of an amp head (Marshall stack, please) with a loudness button that, of course, goes all the way to 11. (In case you were wondering: Yes, Spinal Tap's on Disc 3 with \"Big Bottom\".) As far as the music itself, mainstream metal diehards (and even some casual listeners) will likely have the bulk of the seventy songs. The biggest bands and their biggest hits are largely here \"Metal Health\" for Quiet Riot, \"Youth Gone Wild\" for Skid Row, \"Ace of Spades\" for Motörhead, \"Talk Dirty to Me\" for Poison, \"Round and Round\" for Ratt. No real surprises or Bsides or alternate takes. But then, that's really not what Rhino's pop culturedriven box sets are all about. (Full disclosure: A few years ago I wrote some album reviews for the Rhino website.)The comp's basically an unpretentious, straightforward gathering; and though all the tunes are familiar, it's interesting listening to them as one expansive playlist and finding weird or fun overlaps and sequencing oddities. The songs are arranged chronologically from 1968 to 91 (oh blasted Nirvana!) but the compilers definitely had some fun with how they pieced them together: Metal Church rips into Stryper's \"To Hell With the Devil\", which somehow I knew by heart, right before Helloween's \"A Little Time\". Right after that it's Overkill's \"Wrecking Crew\" alongside Anthrax's \"Caught in a Mosh\" and then \"Peace Sells\". Get it? Or, more simply, Whitesnake abuts Great White; \"I Wanna Rock,\" Hanoi Rocks. It's also cool to hear things that had grown kinda stale reinvigorated by their next context: Like the aforementioned Great White's \"Rock Me\" is kinda great, as is that weird vocal hiccup on Savatage's \"Hall of the Mountain King\".As with any of these collections, you also notice the gaps. It's largely mainstream genres (or mainstream representations of a genre) that are covered, so you don't get any really raw grindcore (no Napalm Death or Anal Cunt) or death metal (no Morbid Angel or, uh, Napalm Death). A friend I was just talking to lamented the lack of Possesed and Racer X. The historical arc in both the accompanying \"A Brief History of Metal\" essay and tracklist could also be nitpicked, if you felt like it. As far as formative crews the set is built around Iron Butterly (\"InqGaddaDaVida\"), Diolead Sabbath (\"Neon Knights\" ... and Dio's \"Holy Diver\"), Blue Cheer, Hawkind (with Lemmy and \"Lost Johnny,\" which he later rerecorded with Motörhead), Kiss, Rush, Deep Purple, Uriah Heap, Alice Cooper, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden. None too shocking, none too shabby.In the liner notes Rhino mentions it couldn't get every song the compilers wanted, of course, but lacking a band like Saint Vitus or the preblack metal of Bathory (though there is some Venom) or bleak symphonies of Celtic Frost seems like an oversight. But if it's darkness (or semidarkness) you want, we do get Mercyful Fate (and King Diamond), Diamond Head (\"Am I Evil?\"), and Angel Witch (\"White Witch\"). You'll also hear (and see plenty great pictures of) awesome upsate New York heroes Manowar (\"May your swords be wet/ Like the young girl in her prime!\"), plus Slayer (\"South of Heaven\"), Metallica (\"One\" and \"Whiplash\"), Pantera, and Prong.The liner notes include an interview with Ronnie James Dio about \"inventing\" the devil hand salute, Lita Ford about being an axetoting woman in rock (she answers the interviewers questions from the bathroom at her son's jijitsu school), and seminal metal disc jockey Eddie Trunk. There's also a \"trackbytrack summary\" written by Canadian music journalist Martin Popoff (each song gets a decentsized blurb to offer a bit of context), the \"Brief History of Metal\" by longtime, recently Mojorelated UK scribe Mick Wall (he makes sure to keep things up to date, noting what happened to some of the bands), and an essay on metal and black magic by another UK dude, Melody Maker's Chris Welch. And, fitting with the overthetop packaging, any of the Rhino staffers with an \"o\" in their name get an \"ö\", and the producers make sure their opening note is 666 words long.The Heavy Metal Box could certainly work as a firststep into metal, and the fact that the songs play out chronologically is a helpful way to grasp trends, developments, and divergences. But if you find yourself more interested in the heavier or dirtier, less so the hair metal (L.A.'s well repped, as is Cinderalla) or hard rock, you might want to pair it with Earache's (so far) twopart series, Metal: A Headbanger's Companion, which, though definitely not spotless, will bring you you closer to the more extreme sounds of Deicide, Terrorizer, Carcass, Vader, and so on.The big question, really, is how much money you can spend. The thing's listed at $65, which isn't bad. Again, you're largely paying for the packaging. The essays and accompanying materials are fun, but the info isn't something you wouldn't find elsewhere, and the tunes could certainly be downloaded, even in this post OiNK world. As a conversation piece, though and hell, everyone who's seen me with it during this review process has picked it up and smiled it's pretty damn tr00. In my case, its main use was reminding me to pull out the Manowar records and play them loudly for the first time in ages. "}
