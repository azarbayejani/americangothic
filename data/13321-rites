It's also one of the better radioready pop records of the last several months, and occasionally a more than adequate (if swiveltroublingly ethereal) dancefloor filler. That's some gap between Acid King and Kelly Clarkson, you know, a challenge the shapeshifting Brooklyn collective Lights meet at nearly every turn; pure, pretty pop rubs elbows with fistpump fodder in the same song, occasionally intermingling but never interfering. That kind of swift and changeable movement between genre means just about every sound they touch on, they can handle. And it's some list.Take if you will \"Heavy Drops\", a sprawling, Dean WarehamjammingwithPinkFloyd slowburner with a supple, slightly sour, countrytinged melody. Or \"Can You Hear Me?\", equal parts Bobby Womack, the Spice Girls, \"Stillness Is the Move\", Rumours, and \"Baker Street\". Shades of the Everly Brothers and Lucinda Williams' better ballads color the multipart \"Love\"; well, the parts that aren't in waltz time, anyhow. \"Hold On\" imagines PJ Harvey as Neil Young, while \"Fire Night\" takes DFA style disco funk to Paris for the evening. I could go on, but unlike music writing that delights in reference dropping for its own sake, Rites' fluidity of motion keeps things from getting awkward and selfcongratulatory. That \"Fire Night\" crackles out just seconds before \"We Belong\" trickles in seems the most natural thing in the world.Guitarist Sophia Knapp and drummer Linnea Vedder, who share lead vocal duties, are blessed with pipes so well matched you might wonder if they're related. Though equally strong on their own, moments where both share the mic seem stolen, each voice coiling around the other before heading skyward. They're great screamers, too, as the louder moments prove; nowhere is this clearer than on \"War Theme\", where nonsense words meet some very serious, fuzzed up rock'n'roll. As riffrockers, the taut, bottomheavy Lights would inspire lighters; as balladeers, they're ready for your swoons now. The compositions are assured, but never overly busy; just as it takes some serious work to map out a builder like \"Love\" or \"Can You Hear Me?\", it takes some pretty solid musicians to stay out of the way of a melody as bloody gorgeous as the one at the heart of \"Nothing Left to Build\". And while not all the ideas are good ones the waltz around \"Love\" is awkward and the Fleetwood Mac cover that closes out the record is pointless there's certainly no shortage.What's most interesting about Rites is what happens when a little snippet of one idea seems to land atop something else altogether. Take \"Love\", which has all the spindly melody of an Aimee Mann tune, but eventually breaks into an \"oohhoo, yeah\" you could build a Jessica Simpson song around. Or \"Hold On\", which starts out screaming and winds up cooing like Emmylou Harris singing with Hawkwind. Good as Lights seem to be moving between one idea and the next, they're at their best when they're stuck between the two, and I only wish there were a little bit more making nice between the bits that rumble and the ones that unfurl a little more slowly. It's this that makes Rites just a little more boring than it oughta be; there's not a lot of middle ground between the thumpers and the swayers, and while the ballads are wellhewn and plenty lovely, when interspersed with the rockers, they do mess with momentum a bit.A fondness for either Sleep or the Spinanes won't necessarily make Rites for you; not many doom metal records take the occasional cue from Bachelor #2, and unless you've got strong feelings for both, enjoying Rites means making room for either. That's what's so great about it, though; save the Vaselineonlens Fleetwood Mac number that closes things out, there's nary a dull patch or an awkward spot to be found here, just a sublime (if sorta schizoid) trip through the warmest, spaciest parts of your record collection.
