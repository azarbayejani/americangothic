{"label":" Hail Social","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/9973/homepage_large.d88959d0.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Hail Social","title":"Modern Love and Death","text":" I heard that you and your band sold your angular guitars and bought synthesizers. Philadelphiabased quartet Hail Social trade the postpostpunk herkyjerky of their selftitled 2005 Polyvinyl debut for this year's selfreleased sophomore effort, Modern Love and Death, moving toward synthpop without giving up the first album's dancefloor aspirations and plentiful hooks. The group seem to have lost some of their personality in the exchange. Classics Dept. injoke moniker aside, Hail Social have been slickly populist since the beginning. That's part of their appeal, but the watereddown vibe too often accompanying such boomerfriendly accessibility is also the band's biggest stumbling block. On Modern Love and Death, the shadow of radio nostalgia hanging over Hail Social's Franz Ferdinandskinny, Duran Duranhumongoid debut (\"Radio, radio,\" singer Dayve Hawk proclaimed) recurs both sonically and lyrically. \"All night, we can listen to the radio,\" Hawk suggests on vocoderenhanced \"All Night\" over romantically gooey synths that could've been eBayed from fellow Philadelphians Hall & Oates. A track later, the title number goes in for funky guitar licks and fouronthefloor beats (too clean to be Shitdisco, not starkraving enough for nurave) as Hawk imagines \"no more songs, no more favorites.\" Could this be love? \"It felt a little more vacant,\" Hawk muses in his polished tenor. At times Modern Love & Death reaches radioappropriate catchiness, but that doesn't mean the songs are necessarily memorable. Nothing here tops opener \"Annabelle\", with galloping drum programming and disco hihat decorating Hawk's sentimental reminiscence about a neighborhood bad girl. \"Hell belongs to us,\" he quips, but he's just as likely to repeat such standardissue pop pleasantries as \"You're the only girl that I will ever love.\" Where a group like Hot Chip would explore robotoflove sonics and give even a song about (say) a \"Boy from School\" a distinctive angle, Hail Social's tunes sound like they could've been played at any 80sthemed party in the past five years. \"I don't know if I can live without you,\" Hawk worries on \"Heaven\", another standout in terms of tunefulness, if not aesthetic or, um, lyrics.  Right, right, not everything people dance to needs to be Dostoevsky, let alone LCD Soundsystem, but Hail Social's lack of unique characteristics becomes a bigger bummer on the second half of Modern Love and Death. Y'all don't want this party to fizzle out early, right? \"One U Love\" blips and bleeps into rapidfire verses, but it's pretty much the tonightlet'sbelovers rule that makes exceptions like Natasha Bedingfield's \"(I Wanna Have Your) Babies\" so refreshing. Then again, \"The Strangest Things\" lurches into an insistent \"Blue Monday\"like bass line, but listen to the two tracks side by side and the differences between New Order's trailblazing genius and Hail Social's shiny, retro adequacy should be quickly apparent. Hail Social may be glad to give the people what they want, but they don't seem to know what people really want.  "}
