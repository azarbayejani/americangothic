{"label":" Lewis Hollow / Cydonia","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13981/homepage_large.4f8b88fb.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"Jeremy Enigk","title":"OK Bear","text":" The unique power of music is to give meaning to that which has no inherent meaning. A note, on its own, is just a sound. Same with a chord or the smack of a drum stick on a snare. But by organizing those sounds, music can give them incredible power, and it can do the same for words and phrases. OK Bear, Jeremy Enigk's third solo album and second since the breakup of his band Sunny Day Real Estate, offers quite a few examples of this phenomenon, making melodic sense out of puzzling couplets like \"Crimson angel/ I live and plant there still\" and \"Morning arise/ Traced by surprise/ In an ocean wind the waves are lost.\" I'm not saying his lyrics are senseless on paper there's inherent power in a phrase such as \"They got it all, but they ain't got emotion\" but I am saying this album lives or dies on Enigk's ability to weave a bunch of disjointed images and odd, fragmentary sensory phrases into something that feels like a story or a coherent emotional statement.Thankfully, the album mostly lives, and it's a small testament to the seemingly paradoxical ability of ethereal, bodyless music to affect us viscerally. To back up a bit, OK Bear is a confident modernrock album, and Enigk spends considerably less time fussing with big arrangements and sweeping gestures than he did on 2006's World Waits. These songs are among his most direct, mature compositions yet in spite of their often oblique lyrics, and his delicately ragged voice is in fine form as he works to sell them. He controls the intensity of each song quite well\"April Storm\" in particular benefits from a great deal of restrain in the early verses, and you really feel it when he opens up in the last verse and the guitars start to grind a little.The album's most dramatic moment is also one of its weirdest, from a songwriting perspective. \"Just a State of Mind\" begins softly, with acoustic guitars and harmony vocals, and picks up with each verse, and then, at literally the last moment, he introduces a brand new, dramatic melody on the last two lines. It feels like the song is about to take off into some sweeping new section, but instead it just ends, leaving the listener hanging. \"Sandwich Time\" is more conventional, and probably the catchiest rock song on the album, with Enigk running his backing vocals through a Leslie cabinet (or a convincing approximation of one). In an unusual error, \"Sandwich Time\" and \"In a Look\" are flipped on the tracklist, both on the rear cover art and in the printed lyrics (\"Sandwich Time\" is actually track seven, while \"In a Look\" is actually track six). \"In a Look\" is a pianodriven song with a good 6/8 beat and some Eric Matthewsish horns on the bridge.The album's production aids Enigk's careful drama management, keeping every acoustic and electric guitar, Rhodes piano, bassline, and synth separate and strong all that space gives the dynamic shifts more power. OK Bear is a good album it won't blow you away, but I get the sense from listening that Enigk is confident enough in his music not to need to blow you away. Simply moving you a little is enough now, and sometimes it's nice to have an album that does that so ably and unpretentiously. "}
