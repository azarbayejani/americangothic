They looped producer Darkchild's synthharp intro from that 1998 hit and let it ride for about two minutes, turning it into a mediative electronic groove. The Los Angeles duo thrives on this type of sonic \"aha!\" moment, finding musical cues that expose the ways that mainstream rap and R&B aren't all that different from what's going on in the more explicitly experimental underground. Producers making footwork, Baltimore club, moombahton, postdubstep, and more are toying with minimalism, repetition, and noise; but the urban music on the radio can similarly blow minds, and is often just as outthere. This isn't a new concept exactly (Timbaland at his peak was clearly an avantpop genius), but Nguzunguzu are particularly skilled at bringing together disparate sounds as if their brains were missing the part that constructs binaries or identifies genre differences. They brought this to bear earlier this year when they stitched together M.I.A.'s demos and oneoffs for Vicki Leekx, making something just as jagged as /\\/\\/\\Y/\\, but way more more fun to hear. The only tangible divide in their work seems to be the conscious splitting up of how they approaching mixing and producing. While their mixes and live sets confidently bounce between genres with ease, their EPs (a selftitled one and Mirage from last year, and now, Timesup) have a different focus. Timesup's three songs and two remixes (by Kingdom and Total Freedom) don't deliver on the vibrant promise of Perfect Lullaby, but they aren't really supposed to do that. The fascinating and sometimes frustrating thing about this group is the unresolved tension between their wideeyed, creative DJ mixes and their often insular original tracks. A good example here is \"Timesup\", which runs on an eerie, arpeggiated synth line, a cracking whip, and a baby cooing (homage to Timbaland's \"Are You That Somebody?\" beat, no doubt). In the middle, in lieu of dance breakdown, there is, for a few moments, a vocal sample from \"Let Me Get That\" by the awesome but unknown Baltimore club producer DJ Pierre, and right there is the Nguzunguzu recipe: mixing cuttingedge pop fighting with hyperregional dance. \"Water Bass Power\" features a dark, menacing synth line that gets louder and louder before circling its melody, while vocal snippets, the ping! of a knife being unsheathed, and dub reggae noises clatter and stomp around. \"Wake Sleep\" slinks along like an Aaliyah single that never was, piling on increasingly avantgarde percussive noises (an opera sample, drips of water) and teasing the gorgeous hum of Art of Noise's \"Moments In Love\". It's difficult but rewarding stuff. A recent mix by the group for XLR8R however, features all of the music on Timesup and places it in conversation with the world of postglobal dance at large. \"Wake Sleep\" talks to a sadsack chipmunk soul remix of \"Moments in Love\" (Jodie's \"Moments in Heartbreak (LOL Boys Edit)\"); the title track provides an extended intro for \"Everyday\", a Chicago juke jam from DJ Deeon; and a raucous Baltimore clublike track called \"Deep Inside Me Groove\" announces the arrival of \"Water Bass Power\". Because their mixes are so effective, it's tempting to think of Nguzunguzu's standalone releases as trackoriented DJ tools. But Timesup is living, breathing music that appears to be forming as it goes along. Here, strange sound effects and samples are stacked on top of each other, teasing total chaos but ultimately staying on track because of the foresight of two producers who know exactly what they're doing.
