Was a time when The Bendslites flickered like Nokia, but aside from \"You're Beautiful\" the Radiohead/Coldplay clone attack has been quiet on most fronts. Well, Norwegian singer/songwriter Even Johensen looks at Stars, sees how they shine. His second album under the Magnet moniker places Chris Martin's frail fixyous amid slow, splashy MORtronica, kinda like Savage Garden posing as Canada's eighthmostimportant band. On The Tourniquet, Stars' tourmate shares that deservedly celebrated band's mannered lushness. Powerpopper Jason Falkner, of Jellyfish fame, lacquers the production just enough to keep the varied arrangements backgroundfriendly. When someone tells Sujfan about the banjos and hushed vocals of \"Duracellia\", he's not going to insult them, but the Specials might miss the slow guitar skank of murky \"All You Ask\". Still, somehow even the frequently employed strings, synths, and musicbox tinkles don't muss the David Grayness of a basic palette warm keyboards, acoustic guitars 'n' beats that tries a bit too hard not to offend. Which is exactly why this disc can fill the postColdplay void on your mixtapes. After deceptively intricate verses that do their best to go unnoticed, the vaguely reassuring choruses leap out, as highcaloric as the aforehinted James Blunt or Edwin McCain. \"You'll get through this if you hold on,\" Johensen sings on opener \"Hold On\", his throat catching just so before the song disintegrates into elegant but empty a cappella harmonies. \"You sing like an angel/ And I fall at your feet,\" goes a similarly overstated hook on \"Fall at Your Feet\", the one to YSI your unsuspecting beloved. Pretty much every chorus is as vapidly manipulative, from the swooning \"Miss Her So\" (Johensen: \"...and I can't let go\") to the equally massive \"Deadlock\", so that the album's only surprise, only conventionally bum note is following the Christopher Marloweesque \"Take my hand/ And I will follow\" with an awkward simile involving the album's title. Like much of X&Y;, Magnet is exceptionally unobtrusive, music to ignore: Falkner's gentle touches will never disturb yours, and Magnet's soft murmurs are as familiar as your computer's nowimperceptible hum. \"I'm gonna do this my own way...I might as well believe in me,\" Johensen sings, echoing John Lennon, and he has covered both Dylan and Cash. So why's he so intent on becoming a more lavish Keane? "}
