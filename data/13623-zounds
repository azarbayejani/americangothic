They make widescreen music full of big gestures and sweeping melodies, and on this, their third album, they sound bigger than ever. Credit this partially to the addition of a small string section on a few songs, but far more to keyboardist Ned Cooke asserting himself at the heart of the band's sound. He provides huge textural washes and spiky riffs on just about every song, blowing the band's sound up from something that was already big on 2006's Granddance to something that sounds like it could make the jump to a stadium any time it wanted. The arcade fire burns a little Down Under too, apparently.While Cooke's more prominent role has changed the sonics a bit, the band remains built around the tension between the contrasting styles of guitarist/vocalists Dave Rennick and Tim Derricourt. Rennick is the theatrical one, opening \"The Night Is Young at Heart\" by crooning, \"Would you be open to a night of total chaos?\" shouting the last word of the line at the top of his lungs as Cooke's keyboards squiggle all around him. Derricourt is his calm, straightforward counterpart, delivering the tumbling verses of \"Kid\" in a smooth stream that rises to the rapids of the bashing chorus, and providing a direct foil on \"Miniature Alas\", where he provides the verse and leaves joins Rennick on the chorus, where the two making a distinctive pairing. Derricourt sing out a little more on lead single \"The Price\", possibly because he's competing with the sheet of strings and synthesizer that deliver the song's huge opening theme. The chorus is massive.While the use of two main vocalists provides instant variety, the band is also keen to explore a variety of moods over the course of the record. \"Don't Stop There\" is the closest thing to a ballad, moving at a spooky crawl, the keyboard theme doubled by a guitar to create a theme that's harmonically offcenter and consequently quite otherworldly. Opener \"Hold Your Back\" comes in with a frenetic keyboard part that sounds like a descendent of Yes' \"Changes\" or Pink Floyd's \"One Slip\", but the song moves from there into a pensive, spacey main section that constantly threatens to turn bombastic but never does.At the other end of the record, big, choral vocals give \"Stepshadows\" a strangely nautical feel over a beat reminiscent of the shuffle of Paul Simon's \"Graceland\". Cooke uses a bizarre trumpetish sound for the opening fanfare of \"Wooden Ships\", lending the song a strangely medieval feel behind Derricourt's falsetto verse vocal. Dappled Cities haven't quite acquired a big reputation outside their homeland yet, but it seems likely they will. If they keep making big, boisterous records like this that are unafraid to be a little ridiculous in places, they'll have to. "}
