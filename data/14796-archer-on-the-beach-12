The Aside was a 13minute disco track; the Bside, \"Ravers\", was an eightminute ambient version of a song he'd first recorded as straightforward, folksy indie rock on 2008's Trouble in Dreams. Not counting his contributions to the New Pornographers' Together, this new 12\" features the only two songs Bejar is releasing in 2010. They're both Destroyer tracks, insofar as Bejar wrote and sings/speaks the words, but the music was entrusted to collaborators: Montrealbased ambient Tim Hecker for \"Archer on the Beach\", and Loscil (aka Scott Morgan, who is also Destroyer's drummer) for \"Grief Point\".Bejar is known for sharp left turns, so like a lot of Destroyer releases, an ambient 12\" is a predictable surprise. (This is an artist who once answered the question, \"How is this album different from the last one?\" by explaining that, this time, his band didn't know the songs.) In his best work, there's a sense that no idea is above being secondguessed, and that the moment you stop secondguessing yourself is the moment you start sucking.These new songs find Bejar trying to acclimate himself to unfamiliar territory, while attempting to use that territory's inherent qualities to his advantage. The verses to \"Archer on the Beach\", for example, play on Tim Hecker's grainy, melancholic music by repeating themselves in slight variations: At one point, the archer's arrows are \"stuck inside a peach,\" but later they're \"slightly out of reach.\" The words, like the music, are unfixed and variable; they play tricks on what you think you just heard.\"Grief Point\" the better of the two tracks is more of a spokenword radio play than a song. It begins with the sound of street noise and ends with the words, \"It is done,\" and between, there are minorkey synthesizer patterns, and theatrical effects: a phone, footsteps, someone flicking a lighter. (The track comes from an unreleased movie of the same name, and those sounddesign elements are part of what Bejar does in the film.) The effect is like listening to Bejar pacing around an empty room, talking to himself. It's an eerie, subdued version of the character he plays on his records: wideeyed, winedrunk, and passionately lecturing an audience of none.Bejar has already announced a new Destroyer fulllength for January called Kaputt. Among the 22itemlong list of themes he included in a press release are fretless bass, 80s Miles Davis, \"the pointlessness of the future of music,\" and Kara Walker, the black American artist most famous for her silhouette images of the Antebellum South basically, \"themes\" that will seem freaky and offputting to people who aren't already sympathetic to his humor and curiosity. But for his fans, this is all code for good news!, and while neither \"Archer on the Beach\" or \"Grief Point\" are on Kaputt's tracklist, they're promising evidence that Bejar is, conceptually, continuing to do what he does best: destroying.
