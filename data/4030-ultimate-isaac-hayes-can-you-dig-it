{"label":" Stax","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/3989/homepage_large.6a91563b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"Isaac Hayes","title":"Ultimate Isaac Hayes-- Can You Dig It?","text":" Today, Isaac Hayes resides indelibly in the mainstream American consciousness primarily for two things: the \"Theme from Shaft\", and his recurring role as an oversexed school cafeteria chef on \"South Park\", where he essentially poked fun at his own loverman image. As much as they've become cultural touchstones, these two things hardly epitomize the man's career or indicate the length of the shadow he cast on r&b.; Here was a guy who cut a few obscure sides and then spent the next five years of his career as a session musician and songwriter for Stax Records, plying his craft in the service of others, and who also turned out to be a ridiculously charismatic performer in his own right. His booming baritone and sweeping Spectorsquared arrangements set the tone for a whole generation of r&b; in the 1960s, while his 70s Blaxploitation soundtracks largely defined the genre with their chickenscratch wah guitars, stabbing strings, and tough vocals. And of course he had his monologues long, sometimes rambling speeches that he unapologetically used to preface the meat of many of his songs. Can You Dig It? packs two discs walltowall with 32 of the best tracks Hayes recorded under his own name, understandably leaving out the significant portion of his career he spent laboring for Stax, though you could certainly focus an interesting compilation on his early work backing and writing for other performers the guy cowrote \"Soul Man\", after all. The whole extravaganza kicks off with that familiar twittering hihat, joined by one of the coolest rhythm guitar parts ever, and...is it possible not to like the \"Theme From Shaft\"? It gets something of a novelty rap, mostly as a result of innumerable terrible karaoke performances, but this is a truly badass piece of music, heinous funk rhythms and an entire symphony orchestra all building to a casually awesome drum fill that drops you into that ultrasmooth singrap. \"Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?\" Hayes was talking about the Richard Roundtree character, but much of it applies to himself as well. A Google image search for the man reveals a gallery of waytoocool shots of Hayes with his shaved head, perpetual sunglasses and shirtless displays of gold body hardware, but Hayes did more than his share to live up to that image in his music. The crosssection of that music captured in this tracklisting is about as good as it gets. Highlights from Hayes' other soundtrack work his theme from Tough Guys is sweet 'n' nasty protodisco with a synth bass part from another planet mingle with album cuts, minor hits, and a few edits of his longest tracks, including a sevenminute reduction of his epic reading of Jimmy Webb's \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\". Thankfully, the compilers have left intact the entire 12 minutes of his definitive take on Bacharach/David's \"Walk on By\", a psychedelic funk odyssey filled with scorching fuzz guitar solos and grandiose string arrangements that's as close to perfect as any song of that length could be. It's hard for anything to top \"Walk on By\", but Hayes hardly needs to worry about that when his second tier includes songs like \"Do Your Thing\", an essential slab of languid bongo funk, the throbbing, hornsoaked instrumental \"Disco Connection\", and \"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquadelymistic\", a nineminute funk crawl capped by an outofthis world piano solo that Public Enemy later snipped a portion of for the basis of \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\". \"Joy, pt. 1\" went a long way toward establishing him as a master of seductive r&b;, wrapping direct sexuality in a pillowy love song packed with flutes, strings and horns. It's actually a little jarring sitting next to the plaintive live version of the traditional gospel song \"His Eye Is on the Sparrow.\" There are only a few places in the twoplus hours of music here where not everything works. \"For the Good Times\" is a little too smooth, while the fiveminute monologue that opens \"I Stand Accused\" is practically selfparody, and boring to boot. The need to edit down a few of the longer tracks is unfortunate, but understandable (if anything they could have lopped the intro of \"I Stand Accused\"), and anyone who wants the fulllength versions of \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" or \"Do Your Thing\" can simply scoop up HotButtered Soul or the Shaft soundtrack you'll want to own them anyway. Regardless, this is a phenomenal introduction to a man whose career was positively elemental both to 70s r&b; and funk and to the development of the album as a forum for stretching out and experimenting.
