Like fellow emergent singer/songwriter Benjy Ferree, Perkins comes from LA (his father was late Psycho star Anthony), and the buildup to Ash Wednesday was a carefully scripted, highprofile whistlestop tour. Shows on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Austin City Limits, and Seattle's adultrock tastemaker KEXP quickly established a fan base seemingly interested as much in his unique backstory and outsideoftime image as his music itself. On Ash Wednesday, it becomes quickly apparent that Perkins has taken copious stylistic notes from an earlier selfmythologizing American troubadour.Â Aside from the clear phrasing and timbral similarities, the surrealistic lyrical tendencies of Bringing It All Back Home and Another Side of Bob Dylan are obvious throughout, while the eerie religious evocations on the title track (\"No one will survive Ash Wednesday alive\") and opener \"While You Were Sleeping\" (\"They hung young Cain from the Adam trees\") clearly connect the record to Dylan's dark, biblicallyinformed John Wesley Harding.Wednesday certainly seems designed to evoke a timeless feeling of closeness and warmth. The standup bass and sharp snare hits that pervade the record give \"Sleeping\"'s streamofconsciousness lullaby appropriate accompaniment before giving way to the gentle New Orleans brass that takes the song to its conclusion. Later, \"May Day!\" is the record's rousing singalong, augmenting rough electric guitar with a shouted, glassesraised chorus.  Perkins' ability to merge instrumentation and lyricism to create a romantic's sense of atmosphere is Wednesday's most striking component, best represented on the accordiontinged, historically informed Parisian set piece \"Emile's Vietnam in the Sky\". The song opens with references to a surrealist artist and a turnofthe20th century French play (\"The Cocteau is covered in butter/ The ghosts of cappuccino and Zaza hover\") before making the intriguing crosscultural connections of an educated traveler: \"There's nothing like French blues/ Blown by the unknown soldier in you.\"  Perhaps logically, Perkins' pop cultural bent and everyman aura also link him to the first of many \"next Dylans\" to emerge in the 1970s: Loudon Wainwright III. \"Sleep Sandwich\" takes a playfully imaginative turn: \"Last night was the science fiction/ Movie with you and me/ You in your velvet space helmet/ Me in my rainbow hat,\" and \"All the Night Without Love\" finds sentimental value and humor in innocuous everyday sights: \"'Touch me,' the graphic reads/ On the magnetic athletic insole sheath/ She lets it go all its life without love.\"  With Ash Wednesday, Elvis Perkins has emerged as an assured, fullyformed cosmopolitan able to merge readily recognizable influences with a sense of theatre too often missing from the legion of similarlyintentioned performers. LAconnected head start notwithstanding, Perkins proves that he's certainly done his homework, but more importantly, that he possesses the ability to create a standalone work that is something more than merely the sum of a few wellworn components.
