And it is... except when it isn't \"Rock Co.Kane Flow\", taken from De La Soul's The Grind Date, actually finds DOOM doing something of a victory lap in 2004 after his essential triad of Take Me to Your Leader (released under the name King Geedorah), Vaudeville Villain (Viktor Vaughn), and Madvillainy (Madvillain). \"Rock Co.Kane Flow\" is a fantastic symbiosis of DOOM's many playful styles, but the beat itself feels weightier than what we're used to from De La and the stakes higher (ahem) than what we're used to from DOOM when he guests on a track. The other high(er)profile collaborations on Unexpected don't always fare as well while \"Da Supafriendz\" spotlights a nerdy side of Vast Aire that often goes overlooked amidst Cannibal Ox's doomsayer image, \"Fly That Knot\" is the second hopelessly corny track DOOM's done with Talib Kweli (see also: \"Old School\" from The Mouse and the Mask) and most of the blame lies with Kweli's increasing ineptitude at hookwriting, it's clear these two share more camaraderie than chemistry.So, Unexpected Guests would appear to be a primer of DOOM's work on other people's albums... except when it's not. Even the most modest DOOM discographers likely know \"?\", a track with Kurious that dates back to 1999's Operation: Doomsday. If we're opening it up to collaborations from actual DOOM albums, why nothing from Madvillainy, or even career highlights like \"Let Me Watch\" or \"Rapp Snitch Knishes\"?Well, we can at least be sure this is a compilation of tracks DOOM raps on, right? Sure, except when it isn't: \"E.N.Y. House\", a DOOM production taken from Masta Killa's underwhelming sophomore album Made in Brooklyn is a entropic flop, two lackadaisical approaches that never seem to mesh, though the \"Street Corners (Remix)\" fares better when Inspectah Deck and GZA join the proceedings.But besides that, Guests reinforces its inessential nature by presenting, for the most part, a onedimensional rendering of DOOM as a lyricist. It's not as easy to, um, Madlib a verse of parody lyrics as it is for fellow weirdo faves like Cam'ron or Lil Wayne, but you get an idea of what others expect out of DOOM a handful of offbeat pop culture references, alcohol abuse, plenty of thirdperson talk. And if you've ever faced the cold reality of trying to find a liquor store in Atlanta on Sundays, you're sure to get a kick out of \"All Outta Ale\", which combines the bootlegger science of Viktor Vaughn with the unquenchable thirst for booze that marked MM...Food. To say nothing of \"My Favorite Ladies\", which takes the narcotic personification of \"Drink Away the Pain (Situations)\" to its logical extreme.The thing is, for a guy whose prolificacy was once his most identifiable characteristic, DOOM is still more comfortable in the album mindset than mixtapes whether it's structure or just artistic freedom, working under an established alias allows him to branch out into stonecynical politics (\"Cellz\", \"Strange Ways\", \"One Smart Nigger\"), storytelling (\"Bloody Chain\", \"Let Me Watch\"), or any number of experimental flows (\"Fancy Clown\", \"Change the Beat\"). It's tough to turn down raps like, \"If the price is right he might sing a new smash/ Then laugh and twist his Rollie Fingers moustache,\" and taken in fiveminute chunks, Unexpected Guests is undeniably entertaining. But the slapdash stitching of verse after verse of \"wacky\" DOOM manages to make one of the most consistently satisfying rappers go in one ear and out the other. "}
