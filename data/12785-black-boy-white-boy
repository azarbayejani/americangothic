His voice is a rawthroated, gravelly gargle, but it's all too easy to tell when he's smiling. And when he's comparing his cars to fruits or candies or Papa Smurf, he's absolutely in his element. On last year's  I Am Legend  mixtape, he bragged of a \"Benz coupe same color Ric Flair hair,\" probably the most ridiculously great carcolor description I've ever heard. Dro's now nearly three years removed from \"Shoulder Lean\", his sole big hit, and he's not getting calls to jump on bighit possecut remixes, the way he was when he wrecked the \"Top Back\" and \"We Fly High\" remixes a little while back. But last year, he scored something of a fluke regional hit when he spazzed out on the remix of his labelmate Yung L.A.'s \"Ain't I\", one of those effortlessly likable Southern synthbangers where everyone involved miraculously seems to be operating at peak capacity. Over that twinkling beat, Dro's worddrunk exuberance beautifully offset L.A.'s hesitant chirpiness and label boss T.I.'s slick regality: \"Rims so big I'm at the tiptop, ain't I/ Choppers in the trunk'll make you do the macarena.\"In a just world, that \"Ain't I\" remix would lead to big things starting to happen for Dro again. Instead, he's sharing equal mixtape billing with L.A., the worst rapper on his label by orders of magnitude, and delivering some of the most limp, unimpressive work of his young career. L.A. is this weird little creep with a squeaky babyvoice and a barely serviceable sense of meter who loves bragging about his shitty halfmohawk and his Urkel glasses. He barely drops one quotable line on this endless 76minute tape, unless we're counting calling himself \"haircut boy\" like that's a good thing. Sharing space with this guy does Dro no favors.That's especially true because L.A. and Dro love doing these whitepeople voices that basically begin and end with Sean Penn in  Fast Times at Ridgemont High, crowing \"Dude!\" and \"Rock!\" and \"Party time!\" over and over and  over. They stay in character for entire songs here, and it completely drives me nuts. It's meant to be funny, of course, but beyond that goofyass cover, there's barely a chuckle in any of it. And even when he's not stooping to lameass comedy, Dro really indulges all his worst impulses here. On \"Shower\", he raps for the ladies with all the cool seductiveness of a lunch table full of eighthgrade dudes: \"We could do it in the shower, get it wet then/ After that, we could go and have sex then.\" On \"Still Selling Drugs\", he flips Akon's cheesedout Eurodance hit \"Right Now (Na Na Na)\" so it's about cocaine, and the three minutes he devotes to it feel endless. Over and over, he sings his own choruses, which is really something he shouldn't do.Even on autopilot, Dro's delivery still has serious charm. And here and there, he shows flashes of his old inventiveness: \"Young shooter, in the Chevy with Punky Brewster.\" But it's tough to calculate how much urgency and joy has gone out of Dro since he made I Am Legend just a year ago. It's not the worst thing in the world that he's teamed up with a terrible rapper here. But every time we hear a genuine star's voice on Black Boy White Boy (T.I., say, or Lil Boosie), Dro just sounds almost as lost as L.A. I really, really hope this guy finds it in himself to pull it together. The world needs more rappers willing to compare their Ferraris to the nose on Rudolph. "}
