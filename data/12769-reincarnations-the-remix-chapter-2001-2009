Obviously there was the track's queer bounce, the futureretro glamrock rhythm partly inspired by Battles' interest in German \"schaffel\" techno, a sound pioneered by the Kompakt label, one of Koze's benefactors. But also: Go back and listen to Battles'  Mirrored. Then throw on  Reincarnations, this bulging new collection of Koze remixes. Rhythmically, they have next to nothing in common. Instead, they're two albums that delight in the goofyuntosurreal things electronics can do to the human voice.  There's hardly a track on  Reincarnations  that's not peppered with tweaked vocals. Koze is a devotee of the ancient art of the vocoder or its modernday software plugin equivalent. He loves to use genderflipping filters to turn his singers into robot androgynes. And he's not above a David Sevilleian blast of pitchshifting just for fun. Sometimes, as on the sublimely silly \"Minimal\" by Matias Aguayo, the vocal is outlandish enough that Koze can more or less stay out of its way. And other times, as on Matthew Dear's \"Elementary Lover\", Koze the remixer overstuffs the track's four minutes from arch, starched whiteboy funk to a Venusian stadium rock outro. If you're cringing slightly at the thought of yet  another  techno remix album filled with identikit instrumentals, know that Koze's vocal play on  Reincarnations  adds new facets to already interesting tracks and turns boring cuts beguiling.  And lest you think his cutups are all laughs, there's nothing comedic about Koze's take on the laidback funk of Heiko Voss' \"Think About You\". Instead he stretches the \"I\" in the \"I think about you\" refrain into an angelic background hum that sets the whole track swooning. It's a subtle move that points up the other thing that makes  Reincarnations  so listenable: Koze's craftsmanship, which is often put in the service of the kind of spacedout, gentle loveliness that characterizes the \"Think About You\" remix. He may have a shameless a weakness for novelty shock tactics, but Koze's also a big softie with deft touch. The aforementioned \"Atlas\" remix is on the one hand truly perverse, stripping away that big, booming, instantly recognizable schaffel beat for fractured midtempo microrhythms. But its oddness becomes enchanting when the drums drop out entirely for a twinkling breakdown straight out of the late1990s IDM school of music box melodies. Indeed, Koze's breakdowns alone elevate many of these tracks, even the \"already good\" ones: the watertorture pauses in Sascha Funke's \"Mango Cookie\"; the ravey bleeps colliding with smeary swells of strings on Malaria's \"Kaltes Klares Wasser (DJ Koze & the Tease Remix)\". Â  Reincarnations  isn't flawless. Koze's take on Lawrence's \"Rabbit Tube\", for instance, settles for the kind of passable but generic minimal techno that's so templeclutchingly dull across an entire album. But the fact that the \"Rabbit Tube\" remix acts more as a palette cleanser here, slipped between Koze's sonically restless technopop (Wechsel Garland's \"Swim\", with its long, silty intro) and dancefloor experiments (the drunken jazz of Noze's \"Danse Avec Moi\"), points out how effectively  Reincarnations  is programmed, if nothing else. That ear for sequencing means Koze's fashioned that rarest of remix albums: the kind might play start to finish, and more than once. "}
