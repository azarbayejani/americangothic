But \"that one thing they did 15 years ago was pretty good\" only works for Nas these days, and Double Bubble doesn't do a whole lot to dispel the concept of this comeback as anything but novelty.In all honesty, take the name off the CD spine and there's really not a whole lot to pique interest. At the very least, Stereo MCs realize that \"baggy\" is no longer a feasible fashion sense or sonic M.O. Far from being dated, Double Bubble is plenty contemporary; although for a lot of contemporary indiecrossover dance acts, that means coming to the \"Setting Sun\" crossroads and choosing Be Here Now. Regardless of what track number you're on, you can be assured that the treble will be aggressive, the overdubbing will be indiscriminate, and the bass will be damn near theoretical you can hear the lowerpitched instrument, but you certainly can't feel it. No, the true issue is just how darn quaint it all sounds; between acid house and bass, this is right in the middle, a straight 7 on the pH scale.And while the BPM stay at a rate that will certainly keep things poppin' at LA Fitness, it befits a maximalism not attributable to Basement Jaxx (though the mildly curried Bollywood strings and onomatopoeic hook of \"Gringo (Ragged and Ruthless)\" could sneak into Rooty embarrassingly underdressed) so much as a Chinese buffet you pile 11 presumably different things on your plate, and yet they all kinda taste the same after stewing in the same sauces. \"Karaoke\" has a halfdecent cod reggae thing going, while the wildly jutting synth bursts of \"Get On It\" are a neat hook, but as each song tries in vain to be the lead single, no sort of interstitial narrative develops between tracks.Because it takes about a minute or so to remember, \"oh yeah these guys rap.\" Not in the traditional sense of, um, MCing, but the sort of interstitial jibber jabber that can kills time until the hook hits again. We're in a situation where Cut Copy will top more than a few yearend lists; certain allowances have been made with lyrics, so you need to really be fucking up with the pen game to make it a sticking point.Â  The \"breakdown\"/\"shakedown\" rhymes are harmless, as are the cornball \"does anyone know the way to San Jose\" interjections, but the moment they try to grit their hands, all suspension of disbelief is forfeited. \"There will be no revolution/ You will drown in your own pollution\" yeah, it goes on like this.And I really wish there was more to report about this it's difficult to say whether it's mediocre or a disappointment considering that by now few people would have legitimate expectations. Problem for Stereo MCs is they now have more competition, and Double Bubble is neither deep or dense enough for electronic connoisseurs, nor is it brash enough to spawn another \"Connected\" with kids sprung off of Justice or Hot Chip. Seems a bit trivial to bestow a sort of martyrdom on this piffle, but the disposibility of Double Bubble is definitive proof of how far we've come. "}
