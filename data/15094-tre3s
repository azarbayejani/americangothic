The Mexico City foursome has spent the past several years cutting its teeth in that capital's indie rock scene, furnishing a catalog that's fundamentally at odds with what its local audience asks of its own: pop songs sung in Spanish. Instead, Chikita Violenta sing in English like the 1990s American indie rock bands on which they were weaned Built to Spill, Pavement, Modest Mouse, Tortoise. In addition, they've opted to record extensively in Toronto with producer Dave Newfeld of Broken Social Scene fame. It makes for interesting moves: while the ultrasaturated tones and widescreen scale that made Newfeld synonymous with BSS play a noticeable role in Chikita Violenta's psychpop transmissions, TRE3S, their third longplayer (released by the Canadian supergroup's Arts & Crafts imprint), finds them continuing to home in on shapes and textures of their own. A good place to begin is the end. In the first warbled seconds of closer \"My Connection\", indecipherable studio chatter is punctuated with a clear invitation: \"Hey, come on in.\" Light, handwoven guitar melodies sprawl in 38 directions at once. People continue to laugh and hoot and holler in the background. A sunny allmember chorus quickly comes into focus. \"My connection just fades away/ My connection just fades away/ Thanks for coming/ Now just walk away.\" Its sentiment isn't at all in line with the welcoming way they sing it, but that opening gesture is one with the rest of the indie rock anthemry to be found here. But deeper inside a song like \"My Connection\", you can hear a sense of rapport that clearly allows them to link up in really thrilling ways at times. Opener \"Roni\" pairs polluted, Ponderosathick riffs with gentler acoustic lines to heady effect, its aired out chorus almost lofty as the ones featured in duo \"All I Need's a Little More\" and \"Tired\". Those two in particular lean heavily on Broken Social Sceneestablished dynamics and sonics, though the schizophrenic pieces of the former glue together really nicely with the help of the singalong at its center. It's a bit of a tradeoff. While Chikita Violenta have no problems huddling together to fashion an outsized vocal hook, much of the detail in their sometimes stunning interplay can get lost in froth of those same vocals. Though it's difficult to find a pulse in the grind of \"The Pause\" or meandering \"Siren\" for example, all of the moving acoustic parts of \"España\" can be found on full display. It's a march that gathers a lot of steam and a lot of tension without ever falling prey to its production values or weighty ambitions. They sound like themselves. "}
