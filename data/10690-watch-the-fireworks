How else to explain how the Delgados managed to fly so long just under the radar? They were indie darlings, sure, but even as far as indie darlings go, the Scottish group was strictly cult fare. By the time the band quietly broke up, after a string of strong albums culminating with the wonderful swan song Universal Audio, the Delgados were still barely filling Stateside venues vastly disproportionate to their immense charm. Anyway, life goes on. With news of the breakup, fans flipped their internal hourglasses and waited for the sand to count down to the first solo album. That arrives in the form of Watch the Fireworks, the solo bow from singer Emma Pollock, one of the Delgados' coleaders and its creative engine. Needless to say, those fans will find much to like. In fact, while Watch the Fireworks doesn't pick up where Universal Audio left off, it owes much to the poppier and more streamlined direction the group had been following. Aside from some keyboards and piano, the disc further abandons the tricky orchestral arrangements of the Delgados' past in favor of the alternately bittersweet and bright hooks we expect from Pollock. All the same, waltztime opener \"New Land\" is explicitly about making a clean break. \"And so begins the show/ And not for the first time/ We step on the fault line/ And just like that/ We watch the fireworks start.\" The fireworks, however, don't really start until the second song, \"Acid Test\", with its familiar stopstart guitar riffs and rumbling drums: Pollock is clearly in her comfort zone here, both vocally and musically. Yet Pollock also reveals a quieter side, unencumbered by the dreaminess that often cloaked similar songs in the Delgados' catalog. The gentle piano and picking of \"Limbs\" and \"Fortune\" somehow skirt folk clich√©s, coming off grand despite the subdued arrangements, while \"If Silence Means That Much to You\" swings wonderfully as she veers from a pounding bridge to a rousing chorus. The short and deceptively upbeat downer \"This Rope's Getting Tighter\" may be yet another profession of artistic nervousness on the part of Pollock \"Keep it simple/ Keep me static/ Just enough to lose the panic,\" she sings but you'd never guess someone with such clear and obvious pop instincts would still be dealing with butterflies.  Not that Pollock has gone pop. Pollock approaches songs such as \"Adrenaline\" and \"You'll Come Around\" as if they are pop, and it's everyone else's problem that they're not as popular as they should be. Pollock sums it all up nicely in emotionally contradictory closer \"The Optimist\": \"As long as I'm upright I'll try to prolong/ The notion that future events must go on/ No matter the turn out is right or is wrong.\" She soon secondguesses her enthusiasm with the selfconscious countertake \"when everyone's watching it's hard to admit/ The movement of shadows that lead me to quit.\" It's a bummer of a way to end an album that finds Pollock doing what she does best. The optimist and anyone rooting for Pollock would say she needn't worry so much. "}
