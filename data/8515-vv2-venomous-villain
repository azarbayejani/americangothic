Calling the people who post there \"Doom fans\" sells them way short; \"Doom scholars\" seems more appropriate. One person's reaction to VV2: Venomous Villain, the followup to DoomasVaughn's fantastic 2003 album, Vaudeville Villain, involved a trackbytrack, tothesecond rundown that analyzed how much time Vaughn spends on the mic. His science speaks: VV2 lasts 32 minutes and 53 seconds, and Vaughn raps only 9 minutes and 30 seconds of it. These simple (if fanatic) mathematics get to the heart of the record's problem: There's just not enough Vaughn, on either the mic or the decks. As on Vaudeville Villain, he's turned over all production to a number of underground heatseekers, and the album's vocal tracks almost always feature at least one special guest from the Insomniac label's roster. Four skits and interludes further detract from the pull, and as a result, the disc feels more like an Insomniac Records sampler featuring Viktor Vaughn than a proper Vaughn release. Fortunately, VV2 manages to hurdle many of these obstacles: Despite the variety of beatmakers, the record feels strikingly cohesive and naturally, when the Villain's on point, he's pretty much untouchable. On opening instrumental \"Viktormizer\", producers System D128 and DiViNCi drop the requisite introductory scifi flickery before coursing briskly through glitchedup, Prefuseinspired drumwork and settling into a scratched beat flecked with guitar and violin. \"Back End\" flutters in on the wings of a menschmachine reminiscent of Disney's Tron, while Vaughn fires out from the corner: \"There's feds at the door, oh it's just Fed Ex/ I thought I heard walkie talkies, must've been them redneck/ Neighbors of mine they fuckin' with their CB/ And we up in the spot watchin' Cops on TV.\" But there are too many problem areas: While Phillybased Session 31's piano breakbeat on \"R.A.P. G.A.M.E.\" favorably recalls Doom's own work on Operation: Doomsday, VV2 executive producer IZREAL and Mars Ill's Manchild squander their verses with clumsy lines like, \"I'm trying to compensate for ya ill rap trace/ By concocting schemes to sell a few rap tapes.\" Likewise, thin, plastic horn synths ruin \"Dope Skill\". Still, these weak spots underscore album highlights like \"Doper Skiller\", on which Vaughn trades verses with Kool Keith (whom some consider Vaughn's primary influence) amidst Sex Styleesque scratches. Though Keith by no means bests himself here, his brief appearance boasts some charmingly incharacter vulgarities. Check: \"Leave ya yellow spots around your bed area/ Defecate around your head area,\" or, \"Urinate on your jacket and leave you pissy.\" \"Bloody Chain\" is another standout, with Vaughn spinning a typically brilliant twosided narrative with guest rapper Poison Pen. However, the record closes awkwardly: The Analears' remix of \"Pop Quiz\", while passable, feels somewhat incongruous within the context of VV2. In fact, Vik raps not as Vaughn here, but as Doom, suggesting the possibility that the track was tacked on as a means of fleshing out an already lacking effort. Throughout the course of VV2, Vaughn drops a number of lines that express a general dissatisfaction with the album, confirming suspicions that he may have largely just passed this one off. The record's opening verse advises, \"Dub it off your man, don't spend that 10 bucks/ I did it for the advance, the back end sucks.\" Similar telling sentiments pop up elsewhere: \"Can't stand the beat, there's no sense bitchin',\" and, \"Coulda flipped it longer 'cept the beat was rather rinkydink\" both speak to Vaughn's frustration. Considering these deficiencies, VV2 feels like a sequel to Vaudeville Villain in name only, not in spirit. Then again, it's hard to complain about having more Doom to tide us over until the late October release of the highly promising Mm Food even if it's just 9\\xBD minutes. "}
