{"label":" Rounder / Waveland","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/3954/homepage_large.85637fc9.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"Hem","title":"Eveningland","text":" Sure, \"countrypolitan\" is as good a term as any to describe Hem's music assuming you know what that term implies. Countrypolitan is the area where the yarnspinning twangloving country mouse and the popsavvy champagnesipping city mouse can break brie and listen to outtakes from the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. And the way in which Hem's songwriters (multiinstrumentalists Dan Mess√©, Gary Maurer, and Steve Curtis) can set a scene with just a few choice words or images and a mix of pedal steel and fiddle would make even the most respected set designers and directors envious. Fittingly for something so cinematic, this album was recorded on Dreamworks' dime before that label went bellyup. It's a good thing, too I assume Rounder would need to push a lot more Alison Krauss records across cashier countertops before being able to justify flying Hem to Europe to work with the Slovak National Radio Orchestra. Each song on Eveningland acts as a tightlyblocked onescene short film, from the sleepy suburban sunset (\"across a gingham sky\") in \"Receiver\" to the lonely and wet pavement in \"Pacific Street\" (\"I don't know you except in the way/ A traveler knows a traveler\"); from the simple sadness of \"My Father's Waltz\" (\"May this night keep you here till tomorrow\") to the rush of fear and exhilaration of \"Redwing\". Even without words, Hem paint a vivid picture the burgeoning rush and relenting ebb of strings and woodwinds on the title track would mesh perfectly with timelapsed photography of a forest bedding down for the night, while banjo and fiddle make \"Cincinnati Traveler\" a wistful vignette of a tourist's arrival in a strange city. When words are in the picture, though, they're placed in good hands. Whether conveying the conflicting emotions that come with the discovery of love (as in \"Redwing\") or solemnly confessing fears and shortcomings (as in the hymnlike \"Strays\"), Sally Ellyson's voice remains pristine and powerful. It's a power evident in even the quieter, softer moments she warbles softly through \"My Father's Waltz\", sometimes even disappearing, but it's a devastating performance, effortlessly carrying the song's emotional heft. Equally devastating is the album's hidden, closing track, \"Now The Day Is Over\", a traditional folk song sung acapella. The stark contrast between the album's lush orchestration and this song's nudity is jarring, and the tremble in Ellyson's voice lends a fearful air to the lyrics. This isn't to say that Hem are humorless. Exhibit A: \"Jackson\", a song probably best remembered for Johnny and June Carter Cash's duet on At Folsom Prison. In the hands of the Cashes, it's a playful rollicking tune about a man going down to Jackson to \"mess around\" and his woman making sure the door hits him in the ass on the way out: \"Go on down to Jackson, go on and wreck your health\"  and don't mind her if she throws all your stuff out into the yard when you leave town, you goodfornothin' soandso. The way Hem plays it with a slower tempo and some twinkling glockenspiel dusting the strings the woman becomes implicit in this tawdry seduction. She's beckoning her man to come down to Jackson in a playful manner (\"Play your hand, you big talkin' man/ Make a big fool of yourself\"), coyly taunting him. Sure, she'll still be dancing on a pony keg that's about 22 liters and he'll still be walking around like a wounded hound, but there's no longer a sense of broken furniture and slammed doors. Indeed, Hem's songs no matter how bleak project a hope and buoyancy that would grate were it not for their deftness and skill. Even with the murder balladry of \"Carry Me Home\" \"So me and Jessie, we left Ohio/ We left him bleeding on the valley floor\" there's hope to be had. When Ellyson repeatedly sings, \"Tell me nothing's wrong here,\" it's not an accusatory order; it's a gentle, comforting request that knows that everything will be all right as the music comes to an end and the curtains close.
