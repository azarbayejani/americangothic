{"label":" Warp","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/15008/homepage_large.ac5ca830.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Gonjasufi","title":"A Sufi and a Killer","text":" The best description of Gonjasufi's voice may have come from Flying Lotus, who gave the new Warp artist a highprofile appearance on Los Angeles deep cut \"Testament\". FlyLo called it \"timeless, incredible filth,\" which reads more laudatory than descriptive, but there's something about that voice that escapes simple specifics. On \"Testament\", Gonajsufi lost himself in the track's wispy, ghostlike soul, but on earlier selfpressed records like Dead Midget on Stilts (Crutches) and Flamingo Gimpp (released under the name Sumach), his voice had a gruff, restless quality. His singing can sound raw, maybe a bit off, but his ability to pull off a frail falsetto and ragged rasp in equal measures gives him a serious depth of range.In pairing with L.A. producer Gaslamp Killer, Gonjasufi has found a powerful outlet for his otherworldly strain of singing. Together they've created A Sufi and a Killer, one of the most fascinating slabs of hallucinogenic headnod music to arise from Southern California's posthiphop vanguard. Unlike the digital bleeps and squelches of SoCal contemporaries FlyLo and Nosaj Thing, however, Gaslamp Killer and Gonjasufi draw from their hiphop background to create an LP that could as easily fit on the Stones Throw roster as well as it does IDMcentric Warp. The beats knock, but for every moment of bboyfriendly atmosphere, there's another moment or a simultaneous one that makes like 21st century acid rock.Gonjasufi's vocals are both haunting and haunted, coolly assertive yet frequently fixated on mortal matters, and they bleed vividly through Gaslamp's corroded analog wall of zerofi psychedelic noise. The results are stark: Brooding, badtrip laments (\"Kobwebz\"), a doowop number punctuated by spacey twang (\"Duet\"), a warping of the blues (\"Ageing\"). Even the more straightforward stuff has a grimy quality to it, particularly the heavy soul of \"Change\", the barjazz tension of \"Advice\", and the woozy \"Kowboys & Indians\" with its Eastern vocals looped against a rustcovered revision of club rap beats circa 2003. A couple of previously issued tracks helmed by other L.A. producers sneak into Gaslamp Killer's showcase as well: Warp 2010 comp selection \"Ancestors\" maintains the psychedelic mood with a sitardriven Flying Lotus boomclap, while both sides of last year's Mainframeproduced \"Holidays\"/\"Candylane\" single contribute miniCasio chirpiness and rollerrink funk. Even with the additional producers and the stylistic elasticity, it all coheres nicely.And if the production on A Sufi and a Killer proves anything, it's that Gonjasufi can stitch himself into the beat whether it's a heavy banger or a quiet ballad. \"Sheep\" is the most notable example of the latter, as well as a testament to both the singer and the producer's ability to salvage a potentially corny concept: The lyrics are a vague and contradictory metaphor about wanting to be a sheep instead of a lion, but Gonjasufi sells it expertly with a fragile, subtly harmonic multitracked voice. And in the more impassioned moments \"She Gone\", \"DedNd\", \"Stardustin\" his offkilter wail pushes an already surreal junkshoprock aesthetic into a kinship with Safe as Milkera Captain Beefheart. There are plenty of times where the mix renders the exact words elusive and indistinct, and a track or two where you might wish they'd stay that way, but the meaning comes clear enough. And what the words don't hold, that incredible, filthy timbre does. "}
