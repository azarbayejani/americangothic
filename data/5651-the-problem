{"label":" Nature Sounds","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/5576/homepage_large.e3a7087e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Mathematics","title":"The Problem","text":" We're a long way from 1997, when the WuTang Clan's second album moved 600,000 units in its first week. Eight years later, in The WuTang Manual, RZA marks '97 as a turning point, when he began \"converting Wu from the dictatorship it had been to a democracy.\" Maybe Ezra Pound was onto something when he famously argued that fascism was beneficial art: The democratic incarnation of WuTang has birthed stellar efforts from Ghostface and RZA, but has also turned out some forgettable solo joints and spotty group albums. Method Man seems to be spending more time on screen than on wax. Cappadonna's driving a taxi in Baltimore. Dirty passed on. \"After the laughter...\" Mathematics has been a quiet Clan associate since day one he designed their famous logo (an early draft had a hand clutching a hilariously gory severed head sticking out of the nowiconic W), and contributed RZAsanctioned beats for albums like Ghost's Supreme Clientele and Meth's Tical 2000: Judgment Day. On his second LP, Mathematics succeeds where other recent Wu efforts have faltered by keeping it hot and simple. Instead of trying to push things forward, Math sticks to the basics, and The Problem plays like a subtly modernized précis of vintage '90s WuTang styles. Should've been called The Solution: Take midtouptempo, cinematic beats and use them for blazing posse cuts that mingle the entirety of the Clan (including Dirt) with competent NüTangers like Eyeslow, Hot Flames, and Bald Head; repeat as necessary.The Problem opens with a reminisce, natch: \"C What I C\", where Mathematics's skittering drums and snakecharming melody pave the way for Eyeslow and TSlugz to reprise the streetreportage/pining for simpler times themes of \"Can It Be All So Simple\" see also the beautifully expressive horns of the elegiac \"Tommy\". \"Strawberries and Cream\" is a honeyed, profane slowjam with a watery soul melody (remember \"Love Jones\"?) and swaggering romantic raps from RZA and Ghost (one hopes his line about \"high school pussy\" is a reminisce as well). Where was UGod on that one?  You've got your party jams: \"John 3:16\", where Meth monkeys around on a springy cartoon beat, singsonging hooks and punchlines (\"got Milton Bradley hating the game\") like Nelly with a personality; \"Rush\", which pits Meth's rubber chickens against GZA's precisely clipped fingernail rhymes; the bouncefunk club banger \"Two Shots of Henny\". Then there are the thrillingly grim tracks: \"Winta Sno\" gets stupid frosty with silvery minor chords and nihilistic crime rhymes; Ghost and Rae slangbang \"Real Nillaz\" over frantic drums and skeletal metallic accents; on \"U.S.A.\" the bombastic spookhouse synths are wellcontrasted by Masta Killa's stark straighttalk. There's something sly about imbuing all new songs with a \"bestof\" aura, and it makes for a strong Wu release.  "}
