They're all that way. What made it a letdown was that there was a twinge of stewing rage in there, the work of someone who tried to do the right thing and still got fucked over anyway. Despite his gregarious and accessible persona, noted hiphop scholars such as Oprah Winfrey and Bill O'Reilly made it a point to single Ludacris out as a \"gangsta rapper\" (this is equivalent to Death Cab being blamed for teen suicide), while the ascendancy of traphop/crunk/etc. painted him as softbatch in his own city (which he vehemently address on \"Been Puttin On\"). I know we have enough trouble dealing with one Common as is, but if Luda would rather just keep his hair short, pen mahogany love jams, and stick with taking roles in questionable action movies (Max Payne coming soon!), hell I wouldn't blame him. With that comes DJ Drama Presents: The Preview, and on one hand, well this simply has to be better than something labelsanctioned. No \"Splash Waterfalls\"! No shitty Neptunes beats (okay, he does rap over \"Blue Magic\")! No Tommy Lee skits about green living...probably! It's typical \"this is for the streets/the love\" stuff, meaning that Luda's using his incredible vocal elasticity describing an unstoppable appetite for weed, women, beatdowns, and general act a foolness. And of course, punchline after punchline that's just barely before its freshness date (\"I'm 'bout to fuck a bitch and get off like R. Kelly!\"). And befitting a mixtape, it's stocked with lame skits, unnecessary guest raps from the DTP crew, and it's about 1015 minutes too long.The main difference is, for the most part, a carefree tone, with Luda raiding my 2000 Winamp playlist he handles Prodigy's \"Keep It Thoro\" and Gangsta Boo's \"Where Dem Dollars At\" with typical agility, and really, dude could turn an ElP instrumental into something for your kid sister to bounce with. Yet while his beatjacking is rarely short of competent, there's something lost in the translation there's almost no track here that improves on the original. How is that a guy who's made a career out of stealing tracks with his guest verses (\"Holidae Inn\", \"Oh\" to name a few) can't actually steal a fully made song and call it his own? When you try hard, then you die hard the best Ludacris moments have tended to be the ones with the least amount of guile, and as such, the more scripted moments of humor are straight openmic night. You'd have to be a total prude to disapprove him turning quite possibly the only good hiphop track that advocates against smoking weed (OutKast's classic \"Git Up, Git Out\") into a tutorial on puffpuffpass protocol, but it's done in such a lazy manner that it actually bolsters the original point in a roundabout way. And, hoo boy the skits. Cross Tucker Max with N.W.A.'s \"Automobile\" and maybe you've got \"Ordinary Negroes\", and while hearing Jim Jones through an autotune is quite possibly the highlight of the record, the fake ad for \"the robot thingie!\" belongs in the trash bin of an aspiring \"Mad TV\" writer.Bigger problem is that DJ Drama is also trying to reassess the value of his \"stamp of approval\" at the very same time, and in a manner that's completely contrary to what Ludacris is doing not since Best of Both Worlds have two rap superstars shared an album less on the same page. Obviously, Drama's greatest contribution is acting like he's trying to shout down Stephen A. Smith just say \"DRAM CRUISE I DO MISSIONS IMPOSSIBLE!\" or \"GOOD CHOICE!\" or \"IT STARTS WITH YOU LIKE IT STARTS WITH ME\" out loud and see what a dumbass you sound like. Not to mention the extraneous dross that drops in under his stewardship (Playaz Circle, I20), none more otherworldly than LA the Darkman's \"Coogi Down\" (what year is this?), wherein he and Willie Da Kid boast about eating chicken parmesan at Italian feedbaggery Maggiano's without the slightest bit of selfdeprecation.All of this would've made a mixtape digested and forgotten by the time Theater of the Mind comes out on October 21 if it wasn't for \"Politics as Usual\". Just his luck Ludacris is just trying to do something nice for Obama and ends up in the recycle bin with Scarlett Johansson's emails. Essentially, this is Obama's Sistah Souljah moment, giving him the opportunity to make bold disapprovals of Luda's views of Hillary (\"she hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant\"), Dubya (\"mentally handicapped\"), and in the money quote, McCain (\"don't belong in ANY chair unless he's paralyzed\"). But let the volley fit the serve, as Luda spends as many lines describing his car's paint job as he does Obama's qualifications. It's a nonstory on all fronts, but nothing requires constant churn like hiphop gossip and election muckraking. More telling is that it's three months from election day and the support of Obama from the pop community feels awfully similar to the Rock for Change campaign of 2004 most of it generated on bold and yet incredibly vague promises of change. At least for Ludacris, we'll see by October whether he plans to deliver on his end of the bargain. "}
