Have you heard Sov's latest 12s? Soft as Baby MC's ace, with beats, rhymes, and life dumbed down for what, Radio 1 and \"Top of the Pops\"? Sov's turned (nearly) from splendid young emcee to Young MC on splenda. And yes, I am dissing her \"95\"; it just ain't her twist. So while Sov haggles in rap vs. pap identity crisis, this Vertically Challenged EP, her first release available stateside, packs all the hard, grimey shit, a comp or even history of sorts of her raggesttaggest jams. \"Random\" has her best bitchslaps, mostly on American rappers, over kicks and bass zoom we'd expect from Timbo in 15 years. In other words, Sov's mean schooling us, flipping our scripts and taunting from afar that she, a 19yearold London hoodrat, does hiphop better than hiphop. I just assumed somebody would bark back provided they knew she even existed; instead JayZ signed her to Island/Def Jam. The whycare of all that won't resonate without knowing Sov's grime scene backstory. There in that fastpaced, viciously insider culture of/for/by Britteens boasting neckle but not much else, Sov found a strong chiponshoulders identity, however racially/sexually (un)determined. From grime, so far only Dizzee's vibe has come as fully formed. If \"Random\" meant war, \"ChChing,\" her remix of the \"Cheque 1, 2\" garage anthem, first read like personal declaration: \"Me na have 50 rings/ But I got 50 things to say in a cheeky kinda way.\" Fortyeight more to go: \"Random\" and \"ChChing\" are two of the best singles of the past couple of years, and Sov recorded boys vs. girls posse cut \"The Battle\" and \"A Little Bit of Shhh!\" before \"ChChing\", so they don't count (though they're great and on here, with meh remix filler too). She has rap knees on their heads why jump shark? To be frank I don't know what the fuck's going on here, who Sov's talking to, why she's holding back on us. \"Fiddle With the Volume\", the EP's one new original, beatstanks durty but, sorry, Bryan Adams did the waking up the neighbours thing better, and that's saying something. Right now I'm stuck on one line of \"Shhh!\": \"Here comes the press!!/ Nuva damn reporter/ Obsessed wid my disorder/ Diagnosis please whats wrong wiv her Bill? She's ill.\" Give shit interviews, fine, but on wax don't stamp yourself out. Please? "}
