Along its fenced banks lie the majority of the city's attractions. Turner buildings, blossoming with neon network logos, lure Yellowjacket grads from the adjacent campus cluster with the sweet nectar of Powerpuff Girls money. Across the way, The Varsity serves grease between buns, communicating with an enigmatic fast food lexicon that rivals rhyming Cockneys. Tourists walk the overpass to the ghostly Olympic park, built on the graveyard of Techwood projects, in the shadows of Vick's pastel dome. Hipsters and reluctant yuppies settle in the gentrified Five Points and Cabbagetown, giving their quaint subdivisions more verdant \"___________ Park\" monikers. And finally, there's Turner Field, reverberating collective October sighs, before the highway splits back into its tributaries in East Point, the cultural fountainhead. The hiphop id to New York's ego: the home of Outkast. Lauded retroactively in 2000, upon the release of Stankonia, for a formula that had been perfected by teenagers on 1994's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Outkast charged up the public with silly amounts of reserved anticipation for this doubledisc marathon. Since dropping that debut nearly ten years ago, Outkast's singles have charted a steady incline of genredefiance and pop virtuosity. But now, in the wake of the commercial and critical smash that yielded such classic tracks as \"Ms. Jackson\", \"B.O.B.\", and \"So Fresh, So Clean\", Big Boi and Andre 3000 have, for the first time, chosen to work in separate corners, like Beatles after India. Here, on the resulting Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, the two wander down the blacktop from East Point, each plotting their own distinct course: Andre, like I85, shoots off to the airport and skyhigh trips before dipping into the Mardi Gras marshes of New Orleans, while Big Boi rolls deep down I75 into south Florida, home of booty bass and baby blue. The consensus in rock circles had unfairly anticipated that The Love Below would reign supreme over Big Boi's Speakerboxxx, since Andre was the one with the guitar in the fuzzy boots. As it turns out, his Princemimicking fusion looks a lot better on paper than it sounds in your ears. On too many songs, Andre repeats spaceplayboy choruses over repetitious, unfinished digifunk. As the brief orchestrated outro to \"Pink and Blue\" suggests, each track feels like it's missing something strings, guitars, harmonies, organic instruments, and, oh right: Big Boi. Andre does have his moment, though: \"Hey Ya!\" glitters and towers like the silver Westin hotel over an 80s Atlanta skyline, blending Flaming Lipslike synthbass and ebullient acoustic guitar with the rebellious joy of \"Little Red Corvette\" and like all classic songs, it introduces new vernacular with a genius that transcends product placement. Even indymedia.org feeders will shout \"Polaroid!\" while miming spanking at this fall's NotDog cookouts. Of the few other tracks on The Love Below that come close to reaching \"Hey Ya!\"'s apex, the one that most succeeds is \"Spread\", which showcases trumpets and piano weaving through a rubber bassline and scattering rimshots. Its chorus has Andre putting on his Camille voice, while the verses contain some of the only moments on the album in which he actually flows. When he does, he's tight enough to pose the question of why he decided to cut back on rapping at all particularly since, frankly, he ranks just above Pharrell Williams on the \"brilliant but mosquitothroated crooner\" list. Elsewhere, the quite literal \"Dracula's Wedding\" boasts guest vocalist Kelis over whistling squelches, while Norah Jones' lovely turn on the acoustic \"Take Off Your Cool\" hints at the true stylistic breadth Andre is capable of achieving. \"Baby, take off your cool/ I want to get to know you,\" they both sing over plucks and strums. Heed your lyrics, Andre. (Except for that \"become the master of your own bastion\" nonsense.) Big Boi's Speakerboxxx coolly upstages its counterpart: Although it, too, provides the world with one earthshaking single, it differs from The Love Below in that it also manages to maintain a consistent level of brilliance and emotional complexity. Here, Big Boi effectively asserts himself as man who wants both a stripper pole in his home and his nostalgic place saved on the pew \"Unhappy\" conveys that in its beat alone! Comparing the selection of Speakerboxxx to Andre's limper Love Below, it's clear who won this bet: Machineheavy, horndriven funk stomps behind \"Bowtie\" and \"The Rooster\"; reverberating woodblocks (a trademark Outkast signifier since \"Elevators\") starkly soundtrack pondering rhymes on \"Knowing\"; \"Church\" takes gospel into the 21st Century, accelerating aluminum Stevie Wonder discopop into Teutonic techno; propulsive kickdrums pump under drunken guitars, scratches, and a JayZ hook on the standout \"Flip Flop Rock\"; and \"Ghettomusick\", the aforementioned earthshaking single, is, emotionally, a celebration and a lament, braggadocio and beatitudes. Musically, the record shifts from punkcadenced, cellulitequivering woofer booms to threewheeled slowjams and back before snakecharming with George Clinton keyboards. Of course, there's one department in which neither disc succeeds: Despite how forwardlooking these albums can be, both members have failed to envision a future without skits and intros, which make up no less than ten of the 39 tracks here. It's one reason why Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, like no albums before, beg to be ripped, sieved and resequenced. Cutting out the dialog, along with The Love Below's siliconsmooth, Rainbow Childrenesque jazz and lulling middlesection, and Big Boi's guestladen, beenthere street tracks, leaves one genius fulllength that fits on a single disc.
