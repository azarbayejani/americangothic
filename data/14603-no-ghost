The songs are inventively arranged, exuberantly played, and occasionally beautiful. There are moments of disarming simplicity the sparse, shimmering ballad \"Misplaced\"; the dusty banjo plonking of \"Slippery When Wet\" and moments of high color and energy, like the title track, built on a needling bed of guitar harmonics and some sawing violins. Like two clear precursors, Grizzly Bear and Califone, the Acorn have a knack for accretion of tiny, engaging details: marimbas, horns, organs, and other colorful elements will often slip fluidly into the background halfway through a song, adding warmth, texture and atmosphere on an almost subconscious level. And yet, somehow, almost none of No Ghost manages to leave a lasting impression. Why?It's a puzzling question, and it hovers over a lot of talented bands dogged by a certain hardtodefine facelessness. A unique voice is a difficult thing to talk about, since no two people can agree on what one is, exactly. The Acorn's sound is indistinct; they make pleasant, fullbodied folk rock, but their sound has a wobbly center of gravity. When they adopt the rangy slide guitar and scrapyard percussion of Califone, like on \"I Made the Law\" and \"Almanac\", there isn't enough Acorn there to keep from the overwhelming sensation that a Califone album has unexpectedly wandered into view. Rolf Klausener's clear, high tenor even resembles Califone frontman Tim Rutili's, but without any of the earcatching crags or worldweariness. His voice is pretty but polite; when he hits high notes on the uptempo numbers, like \"Restoration\" or \"Bobcat Goldwraith\", there is a pinched quality to it that squashes the momentum.There are glimmers, in the various halfideas that surface throughout No Ghost, of a vision that the band could have taken and run with. Klausener's lyrics can be appealingly morbid. It doesn't immediately register, for instance, that the opening lines of \"Restoration\" \"concentric circles signal dinnertime\" refers to chumming sharks. They have a good feel for ballads. On songs like \"On the Line\", the Acorn sound more relaxed than on the uptempo rockers, which betray a whiff of overachievers' strain. The album's most indelible moment is the sweet, subdued \"Slippery When Wet\". The pace slows, the arrangement opens up, and a simple, instantly affecting tune rises out of the silence. It is a humble, quiet moment, but the band sounds more at home in it than anywhere else on the album. "}
