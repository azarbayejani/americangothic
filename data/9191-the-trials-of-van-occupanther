To wit: The sophomore LP by Texasbased rock group Midlake opened at #14 on the UK indie charts more than a month before gracing its sullen native shores. Similarly, Midlake take a step back from the synthage psychedelia of their solid 2004 debut Bamnan and Slivercork on followup The Trials of Van Occupanther, an encouraging but ultimately disappointing contemplation of time's ceaselessness, love's promise, and Harvestera Neil Young. Speaking of time, Midlake waste little at first. Opener \"Roscoe\" keeps getting compared to Fleetwood Mac but actually comes closer to the pristine, highconcept chug of the Alan Parsons Project's paranoid 1982 hit \"Eye in the Sky\" (in a good way, gang) or the similarly anxious spacerock of the late Grandaddy. \"Whenever I was a child, I wondered/ What if my name had changed into something more productive like Roscoe/ Been born in 1891, waiting with my Aunt Rosaline,\" whispers frontman Tim Smith, his phrasing elusive, his grassy tenor warming into multipart harmonies after one of the year's most casually compelling pop moments. Alas, nothing else here comes close: A fuzzy guitar solo goes Lindsay Buckingham's way on the legitimately Maclike \"Head Home\"; monotonous single \"Young Bride\" chases ramshackle dance beats and skittery violins through a haunted and hookless forest; and \"Bandits\" pairs anachronistic wit (\"Do you want to be overrun by bandits?\") with mild woodwinds, an acoustic intro recalling \"Mother Nature's Son\", and gray Coldplay piano.  Throughout the album, the desperation for meaningful human contact glimpsed in the record's lonesome centerpiece \"Van Occupanther\" underpins images of mountaineers, stonecutters, and frozen pines. The album's second most affecting track, hornsprouting \"Branches\", further illuminates the protagonist's heartbreak through ominous minor sevenths, \"Exit Music (for a Film)\" triadinversion segues, and a canny reference to the Jackson Brownepenned classic \"These Days\". \"It's hard for me but I'm trying,\" Smith delicately repeats, his voice falling between Young's woozy falsetto and the sinuous timbres of Thom Yorke. The second half of the disc, however, drags amid belllike vintage synths, pastoral singer/songwriter strums, and a stolid mountain of midtempo melancholy. \"On a clear day I can see my old house and my wife,\" intones Smith, still struggling against the passing seasons for an irrecoverable romance.  After Bamnan and Slivercork's Flaming Lips progressivism, The Trials of Van Occupanther may seem like a retreat. Yet despite all the shagcarpet throwbacks, Midlake's new one rises above retro pastiche to probe its central character, the lovelorn, calendarconfined Van Occupanther; spacey production and allusive songwriting mark the album as a presentday artifact. \"We'll pass by for the last time,\" the disc concludes, but surely a band this promising will be back for more.
