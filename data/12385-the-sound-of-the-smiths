In fact, collections that emerged during the band's lifetime, like Louder Than Bombs and Hatful of Hollow, are more or less part of the group's canon. So while it's slightly baffling that a really good onevolume introduction hasn't appeared yet, it's not exactly frustrating. Does this release do the job? The first disc is fine, containing most of the band's singles and a few key album tracks. The second is messier: Halfway between a rarities collection and a deeper investigation of the group's work, it doesn't satisfy on either level. BSide mavens will wonder where minor tracks like \"I Keep Mine Hidden\" are, while new fans hoping to hear a band at their peak won't bother coming back to pleasant spacefillers like \"Oscillate Wildly\". And with each disc sequenced chronologically, The Sound... ends up telling the same story twice.The story in question is one of the oldest of all: When you've built your art around loneliness and exclusion, what do you do once you find a mass audience? The Smiths' career halves into a kitchensink era and a vaudeville one in the former, the lives Morrissey sings about are greyer and more limited, the action more realistic, the frustrations rawer. In the latter, kicked off by the musichall intro to \"The Queen Is Dead\", the misery is exaggerated into archness, the loneliness played more for laughs. The divide isn't absolute second single \"This Charming Man\" is as wry and sprightly a record as they ever made; latterday BSide \"Asleep\" as dark a one. But in general, the early Smiths are a starker proposition: There's a gulf between the band who made 1983's keening \"Jeane\" (\"How can you call this a home/ When you know it's a grave\") and the band on 1987's jaunty, frivolous \"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before\". That's not to say the group got worse. Morrissey's great contribution to pop is a mode of flamboyant loneliness, and it took a while for that to evolve and peak. My favorite Smiths period is the batch of singles around The Queen Is Dead the singer in thrillingly confident form, slipping nimbly between the roles of martyr (\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\"), spokesperson (\"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side\"), doomsayer (\"Panic\"), and kindly advisor (\"Ask\"). The point of the Smiths isn't that their songs were miserable or that their fans were alienated, it's that they showed how to turn the misery into a weapon, a rebellion, a strength, a pose. In this their wildly successful inheritors have been mallemo teen idols like Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance, bands who've blazed a Morrisseyesque trail into a more traditionally pop demographic. There are two big problems with performing misery, though. First, it's easy for it to set into selfparody. By the time the group split, singles like \"Girlfriend in a Coma\" were setting these alarm bells off frothy, fun, but nowhere near as striking as the band's best work. Secondly, it really helps if you have the star power and natural charisma of Morrissey: Bands with less of a frontman could find themselves in a trap, glamorizing a loneliness they could have fought. Â Your reaction to the Morrissey cult of personality is still likely to determine your reaction to the band as a whole grotesquely unfair on guitarist Johnny Marr though that is. It's thanks to him that everything the Smiths did is worth hearing, even when his lyricist is having an off day. His range and ambition as a composer widened through the band's life, and his contributions remained consistently stellar from the liquid joy of \"This Charming Man\"'s giddy intro to the mockstately chill of his picking on \"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\". His iconic, shuddering phased guitar riffs on \"How Soon Is Now?\" are the reason that track remains the band's best known. Listening to The Sound of the Smiths a project overseen by the singer and guitarist though, it's Morrissey who still makes an impact. There remains the coldwater shock of their early records the rainswept romanticism of \"Hand in Glove\", the doublebluffing whimsy of \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\", and the heartbroken empathy of \"William, It Was Really Nothing\", perhaps their saddest song of all. More than anything, the compilation rehabilitates the band's anger. From \"Still Ill\" through \"Nowhere Fast\" to \"Panic\" the record is full of manifestos, masked by bravado or comedy but with a thread of bloodyminded rage running through them nonetheless. When Morrissey finds a specific target, it results in the band's fiercest music: \"The Headmaster Ritual\" is a thrillingly venomous treat, but Morrissey's agonized howls of \"No, no no!\" on a live \"Meat Is Murder\" are as uncomfortable as intended. If you sympathize, you might find it cathartic; if not, you might think it overthetop a miniature of reaction to the group in general. Morrissey's gestures of refusal aren't especially principled, or philosophical they seem to come from a more primal, contrary place: an instinctive comic repulsion towards modernity and its trimmings, a cackle of despair at a world getting shabbier by the day. A very English impulse, this, flailing at a weakening country though he emerged in an era where even comfortable conservatism was being shredded, Morrissey is really a piece from an earlier jigsaw puzzle. As their sepiatoned singles sleeves hinted, the Smiths are the pop band England had failed to produce in the late 1950s when the postwar generation was making a spiteful mark on every other artisitc discipline poetry, theatre, film, literature. Better late than never. "}
