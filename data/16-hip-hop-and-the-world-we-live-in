{"label":" Project Blowed","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15/homepage_large.1e0b789c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Julianne Shepherd","artist":"Aceyalone","title":"Hip Hop and the World We Live In","text":" Aceyalone's transcendent smoothness is such that he can reference Laverne and Shirley and the overweight lover Heavy D in the same song, back to back. Both references seriously represent for the ladies, and when Acey's extrapolating on the hotness of his \"Dirty Birdy\" who's \"So flirty/ Comin' out the house lookin' all nice and purdy,\" he sounds more shook on lovin' than LL Cool J. But the entirety of this longtime Freestyle Fellowship/Project Blowed emcee's persona is defined by his smoothness, as both an emcee and a lyricist (not that the two are or should be separable). His reclined, effortless flow is represented well on Hip Hop and the World We Live In, a compilation of tracks recorded from 20002002 with Elusive of the Living Legends (soon to be betterknown after Def Jux releases a new record from crew member Murs). Though Hip Hop was made sporadically, within the same time frame as Accepted Eclectic (2001), it's a more consistent offering, without the weaker tracks that kept Accepted Eclectic from exceeding the comfort of \"classic\" and approaching the realm of \"masterpiece.\" While Hip Hop doesn't necessarily launch Aceyalone into those circles either, it's a good, solid example of the art of rhyme. As always, Acey excels at his craft. As proven on earlier AceyaloneElusive collaborations, these two boys were made for each other. Acey's \"Got the ease/ Cool as a breeze,\" and Elusive backs it up with a layered, laid back shuffle of thick, consistent beats, inserting subtle elements of 20th century jazz and classical samples (flute, upright bass, cello, etc) whenever possible. It's somewhat freaky, twinkling darkly with distant skronks, deeply up front melodies, and scary piano lines that sound ripped from the deepest recesses of Henry Cowell, Gyorgy Kurtag, maybe even Mike Oldfield. None of that happyschmappy, edgeless nujazz piano noodling here: this is purely ominous stuff. It especially works on standout tracks like \"I Think I Know Too Much\", in which Acey's authority and anguish is conveyed in a heated list of thoughts that clog his brain: \"Holidays/ Sorrow/ No one is guaranteed tomorrow/ Yesterday is borrowed/ Pictureperfect sunsets/ Oceanfront toxic waste dumps/ I think I know too much/ (You don't know shit!)\" Aceyalone is at his best when he's rapping in precise, simple polyrhythms (occasionally on a feelin' fine, Stetsasonic/De La vibe), proving that an emcee doesn't have to emote into oblivion to sound personal, nor does he have to rock fiftycent words to sound intelligent. Throughout, he conveys a smart toughness, still speaking out against the bling and the thugs, while lauding a kind of humility in a battle rhyme: \"The bigger they come, the harder they fallin'/ All I wanna know is why your man got so much ego?\" The milliondollar question, then, is whether Acey's next release will launch him further into the public eye; after all, he's been a force in the L.A. underground since the late 80s, his fans are loyal, his records are numerous, and he's widely considered a strong talent. He wonders this himself on \"Say\", the nowobligatory, frustrated rant against the mainstream hiphop machine: \"The question is how could a man like me/ Actually be/ A man that's free / Of speech and the ability reach the masses?/ Maybe I should refrain and let the unimaginative, noncreative ones give me some brains?\" "}
