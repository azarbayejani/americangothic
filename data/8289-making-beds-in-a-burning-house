{"label":" Lookout!","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/8152/homepage_large.d05ab827.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Troubled Hubble","title":"Making Beds in a Burning House","text":" Beginning with their quirky name, Illinoisbased touring machines Troubled Hubble are a nerdy blast from the toorecenttobetrendy past. Their style neatly summarizes the musical epoch before Travis Morrison lost his mojo back when Built to Spill were newly perfect, Isaac Mouse had nothing to think about, and \"soccer moms\" drove \"minivans\" instead of leatherupholstered tanks (eff you, H2!). Like a \"Happy Days\" for the geekrock '90s, Troubled Hubble's 2002 wordofmouth breakthrough, Penturbia, was all that, but jollier, idealized. Troubled Hubble's Lookout! debut, Making Beds in a Burning House, is actually their fourth fulllength. In many ways, it's an evolution from its predecessors: cleaner recording quality, a few strings 'n' horns, and selfconsciously literate lyrics (holy Hapsburg Empire, \"defenestrate\"?). Indeed, singer/guitarist Chris Otepka hurls his words in a Mountain Goatslike torrent, reedy voice and all. \"That candle in the window is gonna be the reason your whole house burns,\" Otepka warns before jumping breathlessly to another image and then another over Andrew Lanthrum's lithe, impossibly Dismembered bass line on superficially upbeat opener \"14000 Things to Be Happy About\". Then again, the rush of staccato verbiage on \"Ear Nose & Throat\" brushes awkwardly close to R.E.M./Billy Joel listsong terrain (what else do I have to say?!). A few standouts seem likely to bump up against the latest Clem Snide on your local college radio station. \"To Be Alive and Alone\" is a catchy, chiming affirmation of your betweenclasses quarterlife crisis (\"It's nice to see you back in the game,\" Otepka begins, hoping to \"play\" get it?). Going on a road trip? Throw meticulously straightfaced \"Floribraska\" onto your spring break mix disc. \"There's no place like the Midwest except the Southeast,\" quoth Otepka. The album's most memorable new song, \"Even Marathon Runners Need to Nap\" is a gradually expanding midtempo indierocker worthy of a Grand Canyon wake and bake, or at least the library psychedelia of its forebears. For all the strides Troubled Hubble have made (the dread \"maturation\"!), in some ways Making Beds in a Burning House is unsatisfyingly retrograde, even beyond its derivativeness. For starters, nothing here rivals college radio fave \"I Love My Canoe\", which has appeared on two previous albums. And the song you'll leave humming? Bonus track \"Nancy\", essentially a guitarbased take on selftitledera Ben Folds Five wimppop originally from Penturbia. Still, it's hard to complain while listening to the closing lines, which offer a glimpse into Troubled Hubble's charming worldview, or at least a decent AIM profile: \"What inspires you/ Should entire you/ Live how you want to be loved.\" "}
