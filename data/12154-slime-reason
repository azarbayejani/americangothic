He talks in a manner where he either says the first thing on his mind or he plays with it internally for far too long, a frustrating combination of writer's block and an overactive brain. Not surprisingly, Roots' output has more in common with WuTang than Weezy just four albums since 1999.As such, Slime & Reason tends to work best when it's straying far from a typical rap record. \"The Show Must Go On\" should be a sonically harrowing account of a radioactive nuclear family, the narrator watching his wife and child evacuating the premises as he drunkenly stews in his own piss. But in between long stretches of pained R&B vocals, Roots sounds like a specter hovering above the situation, still shellshocked at how far gone things are. The same goes for \"2 Much 2 Soon\", which breaks down his ambiguous role in hiphop with the bemusement of a bored kingpin: \"Bouregouis hippies wanna fight my flow/ I'm wishin' I was a Trustafarian/ I wouldn't have to hustle and I wouldn't have to swear at them,\" he moans.Beyond the expository tracks, the most successful parts of Slime & Reason are those that break completely from a rap template. There's always been a dubby influence on Roots Manuva records, but here, there's a distinct bhangra/dancehall vibe coming from 2step producer Toddla T that's reminiscent of So Addictive. \"Do Nah Bodda Mi\" in particular works with a very Timbalandish earworm hook, while \"Buff Nuff\" surprisingly turns out to be something other than a rewrite of \"Fit But You Know It\" taken in context of its Benny Hillsummoning video, it's a welcome reprieve from what is usually an oppressive stoneface.But while Manuva's unorthodox style is a unique pleasure, too often his flow can be laconic to the point of being subliminal a good portion of Slime & Reason's midsection demands attention, but doesn't necessarily deserve it, not when the beats that support his rhymes are justbelowscale like the budget gfunk of \"Kick Up Ya Foot\". Too often, the claim of British rappers getting lost in translation has more to do with impenetrable slang, but for those familiar with Run the Road or even the Bug's atomic London Zoo, Slime & Reason can fail to hit on a visceral level. Which is why the mental fisticuffs of \"Well Alright\" becomes all the more alluring you can hear equal parts defiance and sarcasm when Manuva boasts \"I push my pen and blend in with big spendahs\" before likening himself to Jesus (because \"God's my dad\") and summing up his career (\"I ate with the devil but I still ran back to God\"). Ruminative is all well and good, but even when Manuva stays rooted, the thrills on Slime & Reason come from a maneuvering mind. "}
