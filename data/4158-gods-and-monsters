The disc plays like a sex operation gone botched Adonis to Medusa in 10 minutes tops. Three songs into a promising start, the I Am Kloot of yesteryear rears its lyrically asinine head, which wouldn't be so bad if the Kloot didn't regard themselves as \"Harold Pinter real deal to everyone else's overblown, Cecil B. de Mille mockups.\" More problems arise when this band wants to be somebody's soundtrack all vampires and exotic places and from there the degeneration's traceable: The straightforward \"No Direction\" largely succeeds, \"Over My Shoulder\" straddles the goodtougly divide, and \"An Ordinary Girl\" is a fullblown suckfest. Moody Doveslike undercurrents work in small doses but wilt when spooned out in large doses. If you're looking for reference points, Cinerama's shtick isn't far off, except that was smart. You never caught David Gedge singing about the \"bald raging flame of your heart\" or recounting Gothic tales of \"ordinary\" girls in what he thinks are fiftypence words. I Am Kloot singer John Bramwell's execution is gloomily expressive at best, melodramatic as a rule, and when the Wurlitzers materialize like dry ice at a Backstreet Boys concert, shit's more exasperating than convincing and tiresome, too.  While it's true that stories don't tell themselves, Kloot's stories might speak volumes if Bramwell sang less. Loungey \"Avenue of Hope\" could be an Angry Inch Bside, if this Hedwig were a wholly sincere woman with a deep voice and razorthin vocal range instead of an affected man with with an overdeveloped sense of misanthropy and a razorthin vocal range. \"Hong Kong Lullaby\" feels like a cheap shot at fluffy pillowsoftness, offering respite from billowing swells of overinstrumentation but little else; \"I Believe\", a weirdly compelling Nick Drake anthemcumrescue mission, comes tacked on as a bedside prayer finale that also fails to salvage or move (to tears or otherwise) thanks to the tyranny of circumstance. For all their godlike aspiration, it's a shame that I Am Kloot basically don't do Genesis.  "}
