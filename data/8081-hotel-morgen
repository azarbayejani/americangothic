Hotels are places of transience, refuge and the very briefest of romantic encounters. As I unwrap the cellophane from To Rococo Rot's fifth album, I can scarcely shake the memories of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in which Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo violate hotel rooms in ways that would have Aerosmith shrinking in repulsion. Things happen in hotels. The White Stripes (\"Hotel Yorba\"), Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds (\"God's Hotel\"), and yes, even Cassidy & R. Kelly (\"Hotel\") have all recognized the strange echoes and rhythms that permeate these rooming houses of the drifting, unsettled and hedonistic. I, for one, was looking forward to To Rococo Rot's entry into this canon. This German outfit started as an art project back in 1995, but despite their trademark smoothness, they seem to mute all expressive idiosyncrasies in favor of tribute to (and emulation of) any number of influences. Broadly speaking, Hotel Morgen fills in a few gaps between Kraftwerk and Plaid, but is never as interesting as this might suggest. To their credit, they've resisted the forays into drumnbass that seem to tempt most stalwart electronica artists, but the Lippok brothers and Stefan Schneider do lean towards house (\"Bologna\") and lounge (\"Sol\") here without ever owning the styles. In short, Hotel Morgen mirrors an array of contemporary electronic approaches, but its reflected image takes a bit of the luster away. Not exactly The Animals' \"Hotel Hell\". More than previous To Rococo Rot releases, Hotel Morgen is rooted in somnambulance, with lulling tracks like \"Non Song\" and \"Opak\" recalling Eno's Music for Films and Apollo Atmospheres and Soundtracks in a kind of hazy ambience that's always a little too clinical to ever be called \"warm.\" Minimalist act SND, meanwhile, are masters of the palette borrowed by cuts like \"Bologna\" and \"Ovo\", the latter being this album's most abstract and challenging contender. Unfortunately, this liberal borrowing of wellregarded electronic templates poses a problem for the trio, as they erratically adopt a few too many styles, and rarely live up to their inspirations.Hotel Morgen may be beautifully produced, but despite its expert attention to detail, few of these tracks truly engage in the way they seem meant to. Although the adjective \"pleasant\" frequently springs to mind, To Rococo Rot are lagging creatively here, and as a result, the bulk of Hotel Morgen seems to soak in a kind of noncommittal sonic hibernation. Perhaps they could do with a few nights in a real hotel. "}
