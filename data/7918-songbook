On his third album in the last six months, Japan's Nobukazu Takemura closes his laptop, sits down with partner Aki Tsuyuko, and makes an album of songs backed with (mostly) acoustic instruments. In the past, Tsuyuko has provided the vocal inspiration for career highlights like \"Kepler\" and \"Wax & Wane\", though on the last couple of Takemura projects she's been replaced by processed and computergenerated voices. While not a technically adept vocalist (she's a keyboard player by training, and her own solo material is instrumental), Tsuyuko's simple and direct style has been the right accompaniment for Takemura's child'seye view. Pairing the two over the course of an album sounds like heaven for admirers of twee electronics. Problems are evident on the opening \"Mirror Tower\", which is just Takemura's nylonstringed guitar and Tsuyuko's voice. Tsuyuko's notes sound almost random, for one thing there's essentially no melody. It has a certain Shaggsish charm, I guess, in that it sounds \"innocent\" and so forth, but the track is all atmosphere and no song. Fortunately, \"Mahou No Hiroba\" is a terrific followup. There's still not much in the way of a tune, but \"Mahou No Hiroba\" is less about melodic development, and more of endless build through repetition. There's propulsion in the blend of acoustic guitars, vibes, organ and crisp jazzstyle drums (which I believe are programmed); the way the song stacks its blocky chords almost seems like a gentle, discordant, farEast version of Stereolab's \"Jenny Ondioline\". This track is nine minutes long but doesn't seem it, and it's one of the best things Takemura has done. Unfortunately, nothing else here comes close to \"Mahou No Hiroba\". With 19 tracks running almost 80 minutes, Songbook is way, way, way too long, but that's come to be expected from Nobukazu Takemura. When he has a good idea he tends to drive it into the ground, making the listener tire of the track before it ends. But on Songbook, the good ideas don't come often enough. Roughly half the tracks sound like throwaways, nothing more than some clever instrumental flourishes laid beneath Tsuyuko's offkey warbling. I consider myself a pretty serious Nobukazu Takemura fan and I enjoyed Aki Tsuyuko's solo record, but I honestly can't understand what anybody could get from \"From the Ocean of Forest\", \"Tadpole in the Puddle\" or \"Obaoba\"; there's just nothing there, no melody, harmony, hook or texture. Plenty of great tunes have come from singers who could only sing three or four notes, but all of these had someone behind them who knew how to use that handful of tones to their best advantage. Both Takemura and Tsuyuko sound utterly lost inside most of these tracks. There are a few exceptions, like \"Turutiksbinbon (Fr ver)\" (easily the best tune of the bunch, though the melody only lasts two bars and still goes on for 8+ minutes) and \"Uruu\" (which, with its thick organ and breathy vocals, reminds me a lot of Bj√∂rk). These few highlights and the fantastic \"Mahou No Hiroba\" keep Songbook from being flatout bad, but just barely. As an album of songs, Songbook fails. A major disappointment. "}
