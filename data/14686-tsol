{"label":" Decon / Black Box","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/15750/homepage_large.9fc48e29.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Shad","title":"TSOL","text":" Earnestness in hiphop has been synonymous with corniness for far too long; at some point we have to get rid of this postbackpacker hangover.Â For all the indierap iconoclasts who've gone introspective somewhere between \"Through the Wire\" and \"Thank Me Now\", there's still a sense that the averagethoughtfuldude persona is less appealing than the largerthanlife shittalker. And why not? The shittalkers are more fun. This is why the best everymanrap practitioners make sure that their beats punish speakers and their punchlines are more than your typical rimshot fodder.Shad recognizes this, and that's why TSOL is a modest but admirable success. The Kenyaborn, Ontarioraised rapper has been pegged by the faithful as a new standard bearer for positive rap, and somewhere between this album's Polaris Prize nomination and its recent rollout to markets outside Canada, a lot has been made of his potential to be a new voice for fans of Talib Kweli and Common. It definitely aims for that: Despite a discreet indierock crossover vocal from Broken Social Scene's Brendan Canning on \"Lucky 1's\", the productionbycommittee sound doesn't stretch the backpacker boombap parameters too far.Still, Shad's a bit different from your typical conscious figurehead in that he seems more interested in contemplating than crusading. He notes the trap of his supposed niche with some selfawareness on \"Keep Shining\" \"it's funny how words like 'consciousness' and 'positive music' can somehow start to feel hollow\" a line that's dropped in the process of declaring that dudes need to stop just rapping about strong women and actually give them the mic for once.What Shad reveals of himself on TSOL is spiritual without being preachy, righteous without being selfrighteous, and human without sounding mundane. \"Telephone\" is a rare breakup track that doesn't devolve into selfpity or bitter fingerpointing instead, it slips its matteroffactness inside some simple wordplay without  ducking culpability. \"At the Same Time\" deals with emotions introspectively. And \"Listen\" is a compelling portrait of someone who gets completely lost in music, as it shifts from a display of his eclecticism (\"listening to 'Strange Fruit', Jeru, and Beirut\") to an examination of how he draws his inspiration. If all this humble empathy means that he sounds a bit outofcharacter (albeit entertainingly so) when he goes into worldbeating battlemonster mode on \"Yaa I Get It\", at least he compensates by following up his bragging with a bit of metaselfawareness: \"I hope I ain't boring y'all rappin' 'bout rap/ But the only thing I love more than rappin' is nappin'/ And I know nobody want to hear me rap about that.\" I don't know he's probably relatable enough to get away with it.
