The duo's members, Vast Aire and Vordul Mega, had something to prove. Definitive Jux label head ElP, who produced the album, was fired up to define himself postCompany Flow. And underground hiphop was at the perfect point to accept a new vanguard for postWuTang spiritual headknock. But bridges have been burned, beefs over business have gone down, and all the players have been left to their own devices. The more time that passes, the easier it is to wonder how well the sum of CanOx's parts could survive independently of each other. For a while after the release of 2008's Dueces Wild, it looked like Vast Aire was finally starting to shift the conversation from \"when's the next CanOx album?\" to \"when's the next Vast album?\" But any feeling of momentum from that release has vanished on OX 2010: A Street Odyssey. It takes 35 seconds for the spaceage triumphalism of \"Nomad\" to get to this cornball lyric: \"And even though I do yoga/ Trust me, Vast Aire has never been a poseur.\" Over a beat evoking some sort of futurist celestial majesty, that headslapper of a punchline is only the first of several moments where it feels like Vast is stuck somewhere between badass and goofball. In splltting the difference, he just sounds stilted. Other verses tread a similar line. \"My dad is a Magnum/ I'm a son of a gun,\" Vast jokes on \"2090 (So Grimmy)\". The wickedcarnival scenario of \"Merry Go Round\" has just the minimum amount of dignity to keep it from seeming like a bid for Juggalo crossover fandom. And the goopy wuvrap of \"Horoscope\" is way too treacly from someone who once poured his heart out on The Cold Vein's devastatingly sincere \"The FWord\". The most cringeworthy moment comes in closer \"Battle of the Planets\", where Vast actually recycles the refrain from \"Scream Phoenix\", turning The Cold Vein's most lifeaffirming moment into a grudge taunt at the expense of former Weathermen crewmate Cage. His deliberate, heavily enunciated growl underlines every embarrassing lyrical decision in red pen. At least OX 2010 doesn't feel entirely like one MC stranded in his own malaise. The beats are serviceable, with some unostentatious boombap from the likes of Kount Fif, Harry Fraud, and Ayatollah. And the guest verses range from complementary mediocrity (Cappadonna treading water on \"I Don't Care\") to complete upstagings (Guilty Simpson going berserk on \"The Verdict\"). Unfortunately, the album's most headlinegrabbing collaboration a brief reunion with Vordul on \"Thor's Hammer\", with a reused Raekwon verse from Blood on Chef's Apron taking the first slot is also its biggest disappointment. There are plenty of ways to get people to stop clamoring for a Cannibal Ox reunion. This album's the saddest one. "}
