{"label":" Scion A/V","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/17116/homepage_large.dbb6de53.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Evan Minsker","artist":"The King Khan Experience","title":"Scion A/V Presents: The King Khan Experience","text":" Last year, Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson asked the King Khan & BBQ Show to join their curated Vivid Live festival in Sydney alongside Tuvan throat singers, Reed's Metal Machine Trio, and the Blind Boys of Alabama. According to Khan, Reed and Anderson wanted the duo to \"put back the danger into the devil's music.\" His antics at the event, which ultimately led to his breakup with Mark Sultan, proved that assessment accurate. His live shows are unpredictable and wild. His music with BBQ, Tandoori Knights, and the Shrines is driven by an energetic, fiery soul that jumps straight out of the 1950s and 1960s a time when several of pop music's central characters were handsome, wildeyed men screaming and pushing that \"devil’s music\" to America's children. King Khan is the same sort of dangerous and then some: He's usually shirtless (in the very least) and he unleashes Wilson Pickett shrieks, exudes grease and sex, and has a knack for being gratuitously crass. That's why this Scion EP by \"the King Khan Experience\" is so disappointing. The palpable feeling of danger from Khan's work never comes into play. Where his material with the Shrines felt like a sharp rock and soul review, the Experience comparatively sags. The Shrines' What Is?! was backed by a tight horn section and some onpoint melodyaccenting guitars. Meanwhile, the Experience features organ and poorly utilized horns. Many of the reference points seem to come less from the 60s and more from the indulgent, jammy 70s the wandering organ and the loose blues guitar solo of \"Knock Me Off My Feet\" feel sloppy in comparision to past material. What's worse, Khan sounds tired. His vocals frequently drag, and even his \"OWW\"'s come off less wild than usual. A few songs hint at the electrifying promise he made with the Shrines, but they ultimately slip up somewhere. The opening guitar and percussion drive of \"Come Levitate With Me\" sound like they're about to build into a party song, but then the song just slows down with a Herbie Mannish flute solo and Khan's monotonous, dragging vocals. \"I Got Love\" is the song that begs for horns and speed, but neither happen. The only track that truly hits is his tribute to Jay Reatard: \"Hammer Ich Vermisse Dich\", a German cover of Reatard's \"Hammer I Miss You\". It’s unclear why the song is in German, but through the language barrier, you can hear Khan's passionate delivery. He's backed on the chorus by what sounds like German schoolgirls, and there's glitchy percussion driving the whole thing. It’s a touching tribute to his friend, if only from the titular message: \"I miss you.\" Maybe the EP was a place to put out some odds and ends that don't have a clear place with any of his other bands it really does sound like a hodgepodge. We get \"Are You Serious?\", a lofi goof on Jimi Hendrix's \"The Wind Cries Mary\" and Are You Experienced. (The song might explain the new band name.) He also offers \"Keep It Simple Stupid\", a bit of clichéd Eastern psych with a toolong whine. There is \"Bob Log Stomp\", a track that would fit tidily with BBQ or the Shrines, but it's basically a \"somebody pooped in my scotch\" joke, and it's not even as funny as \"Tastebuds\". Throughout, we get a shadow of Khan as \"wild man\" as joker as rocker. His best work comes from a place that's unhinged. This material's too toneddown and wandering. In \"I Got Love\", he sings: \"It's a question of soul/ Some people got it and some people don't.\" This turns out to be a supremely a misplaced lyric on an EP where the man's delivery is so flat. "}
