{"label":" Nature Sounds","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/2019/homepage_large.a0c6a88a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Rollie Pemberton","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Convexed","text":" When it comes to the game of modern compilations, the main caveat is longevity. In the fast moving worlds of both commercial and underground mixtapes, success in collaring the most relevant acts and freshest cuts is the difference between flashinthepan and beat culture empire. In regards to the Nature Sounds team, their display of talent remains balanced enough to warrant a listen. As expected from an album that exists upon the inherent differences of the artists involved, Convexed touches myriad concepts with several atypical approaches: exCannibal Ox magnate Vordul extols the virtues and problems with habitation in ghetto in two tastes (\"In the Hood\" with Carnage, \"Never Gonna Hurt Again\") from his upcoming Nature Sounds solo record, MF Doom indulges in aural fear and loathing with his stellar drug and drink anthem \"All Outta Ale\" and RA The Rugged Man & Timbo King contrast the differences between both positive and negative spectrums on \"Black and White\". While the majority of the record falls positively, a few tracks lower this high standard. Nature Sounds artists Space and Ancient Coins bore in the manner expected from label upstarts on a starstudded compilation, while the surprising appearance of a Cannibal Ox track (\"Handle That\") leads to a sign of the times: Vordul rapping the same goingforbroke abstract word salad that helped make The Cold Vein a classic, Vast Aire rehashing a lame freestyle from his unbalanced mixtape album and then awkwardly freestyling out of the verse (\"And it's like that [awkward silence]/ Cannibal Ox [more awkward silence]/ I wear mini hats/ Whether the jimmy or the New Era/ I get on the mic and sound clever\"). This is the same guy that once said, \"You've got beef but there's worms in your Wellington\"? The most powerful statement is Aesop Rock's contribution, \"Numb (To the Guns)\". Opening with a news reporter speaking from the middle of an Iraq hot zone, Aesop Rock gives his hilarious and lackadaisical take on the war on Iraq, juxtaposing the convenience of watching war with other common television with intriguing results. Unloading great wordplay (\"Me and my fine T&A; on TNT,\" \"P.O.WB, buzz over the rumble of cannons and lead sandwiches\"), Aesop claims to have empathy for the battle situation, but is unfortunately more concerned with watching Bring It On, and having \"Wolf Blitzer 'holler at his boy' when he hosts Blind Date.\" When asked for his opinion on the war in a street news interview, his answer is simple: \"War sucks donkey dick, what's the Knicks score?\" It's a refreshingly loose vision of a commonly maligned topic, given a lighter approach from the person many wouldn't expect it from. The production is a definite bright spot for the Nature Sounds team. With the majority produced by Nature Sounds (with some work from the Professor and Omega One), the beats succeed in mirroring the personalities of the rappers, from the gorgeous Mobb Deep soulful boom bap of Vordul's \"Never Gonna Hurt Again\" to the sharply chopped Premieresque piano jazz of Count Bass D's \"Dro Grown\" to the red hooked Twilight Zone guitar loop of Cage's \"Middletown NY\". A couple beats disappoint, most notably Cannibal Ox's \"Handle That\", with its lazy gear shifting sample and boring dub chimes, and Zion I's \"Spinning\", which sounds like a strangled Dr. Mario instrumental. While some songs meander and fail to fully develop, others completely fall flat and several never catch your attention, the intent is complete: Nature Sounds makes a name for itself through a nicely produced, traditional hiphop compilation that both gives hope to the direction of some artists and reinforces the positives of others.
