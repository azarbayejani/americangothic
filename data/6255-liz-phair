{"label":" Capitol","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/6165/homepage_large.97410789.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Matt LeMay","artist":"Liz Phair","title":"Liz Phair","text":" It could be said that Liz Phair's greatest asset has always been her inability to write a perfect pop song. On her 1993 debut, Exile in Guyville, Phair's gruff voice wrapped awkward nonhooks around flimsy, transparent chord progressions, resulting in (to everyone's surprise) a certifiable indie roadtrip classic. It still stands as a powerfully confrontational album, skirting convention yet marked by Phair's striking awareness of her own limitations. Unfortunately, it seems that Phair has spent the better part of her postExile career trying to gloss over the very limitations that made her original statement so profound. Though her second album, WhipSmart, had a few choice moments which recalled the insight and complexity of Exile, it ultimately seemed like a much more calculated affair. Things didn't start to go horribly awry, of course, until Phair's next album, Whitechocolatespaceegg. That record's attempts to radioize her sound only dismantled the depth of her music if not the awkwardness resulting in an odd batch of songs that perhaps encapsulated Phair's faulty view of what constitutes a radiofriendly album. Ten years on from Exile, Liz has finally managed to achieve what seems to have been her goal ever since the possibility of commercial success first presented itself to her: to release an album that could have just as easily been made by anybody else. Even the songs on Liz Phair that could be considered \"shocking\" or \"profound\" are gratuitous and overdetermined, eschewing the stark and accusatory insights of Exile in favor of pointless fbombs, manipulative ballads, and foulmouthed shmeminism. Liz Phair has always been known for her vulgarity, but on Exile and parts of WhipSmart, she put that trait to good use. On \"Fuck and Run\", a standout from Exile, Phair used the word's negative connotations as a means of pointed selfdeprecation and lamented, \"Whatever happened to a boyfriend/ The kind of guy who makes love cause he's in it/ I want a boyfriend/ I want all that stupid old shit/ Letters and sodas.\" \"Flower\", Phair's most notorious track to date, reads like a laundry list of graphic sexual desires, but rather than paint a uniformly flattering portrait of her love interest, he's immature, he's obnoxious, and despite it all, she still wants to fuck his brains out a simple, necessarily crude semicontradiction that speaks volumes. \"Flower\" would seem to have a descendent in \"H.W.C.\" (\"Hot White Cum\"), in which Phair extols the virtue of semen as a beauty aid (\"...Dear Cosmo: Splooge, The New Rouge!\"). But, unlike the complex, alternatingly cocky and selfeffacing sexuality of \"Flower,\" \"H.W.C.\"'s unqualified spermpraise is entirely vain and degrading. Even more degrading is the constipated donkeyfuck harmonica solo towards the track's end, a hilarious sideshow that only magnifies the triteness of the song's glycerinslick production. Though \"H.W.C.\" is without question the best watercooler conversation piece on Liz Phair, \"Rock Me\" makes for a close second. Here, Phair sings exuberantly about the benefits of an affair with a younger guy including I shit you not \"[playing] Xbox on [his] floor.\" In between choruses of, \"Baby baby baby if it's alright/ Want you to rock me all night,\" Phair declares, \"I'm starting to think that young guys rule!\" without a trace of selfdoubt or reflection. It's hard to imagine that the Liz Phair of ten years ago wouldn't have had something profound and devastating to say about older women who shack up with clueless college kids, but on \"Rock Me\" as on the rest of Liz Phair vapid, clichéfilled rhyme couplets dominate. Take, for example, the album's first single, \"Why Can't I\", \"co\"written by Avril Lavigne songwriting team The Matrix. With a chorus of, \"Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?\" and a cookiecutter rock/pop background, the song could easily pass for Michelle Branch. The lyric, \"We haven't fucked yet/ But my head's still spinning,\" seemingly seeks to set Phair apart from the teenpop crowd, but the use of the word is completely gratuitous change it to \"kissed\" and stick a 16yearold girl in front of the mic and no one could tell the difference. Only on \"Little Digger\" does Phair attempt to tackle subject matter unique to the circumstances of her own life as a 36yearold single mother. The song has received positive press for addressing a difficult issue, as Phair sings to her son about his absent father and the new men she's dating. But the fact that anything positive could be said about this track speaks only to the overwhelming lack of substance on this record. From its cloying synthstring arrangements to its balladinabox drumbeat to its infuriatingly manipulative chorus of, \"My mother is mine,\" \"Little Digger\" offers up all the insight and emotion of a UPN sitcom. In recent interviews, Phair has been upfront about her hopes of mainstream success, and claims full awareness that Liz Phair is likely to alienate many of her original fans. What she doesn't seem to realize is that a collection of utterly generic rockedout pop songs isn't likely to win her many new ones. It's sad that an artist as groundbreaking as Phair would be reduced to cheap publicity stunts and hypercommercialized teenpop. But then, this is \"the album she has always wanted to make\" one in which all of her quirks and limitations are absorbed into welltested clichés, and ultimately, one that may as well not even exist.
