On the Zincs' 2005 album Dimmer, ChicagoviaAlbion singer/songwriter Jim Elkington brought a bleak touch of funny to the folktinged indie rock he'd honed since his days in dour 90s UK bands Sophia and Elevate. Just a touch, though, which when it comes to love, anyway was all the musicfactory workers of Clivilles & Cole really needed. Hey, it was in Sister Act!. The Zincs' third album, Black Pompadour, engenders more awkward chuckles than outright guffaws. The brooding midmidtempo pacing and smoky classicrock guitar grandeur set a table for some serious moping. Elkington's uneasy baritone conjures up the type of blokes who aren't exactly quick with, um, jokes: Jim \"Spanky\" Morrison, David \"the Knife\" Bowie, fellow sad Brit popster Richard \"Oates\" Hawley, ol' what'shishaircut from Editors, etc. John McEntire's clear, detailrich mix lets the moody bass lines, toms, and keyboards settle behind the, like, just good songs, duders. Well, there's the typical rub, right? Chicago guitar guy Nathaniel Braddock's perambulating watchthisriff riffs deserve better than phrases like \"selfmesmeric drones,\" but Elkington's lyrics don't stop at accidental selfcriticisms. Somebody's got a case of staggering bombast: \"Would that I were as young as those muskagers,\" he intones ponderously on \"Burdensome Son\". Gentleman tops himself on wordcrazy \"Hamstrung and Juvenile\", groaning, \"Once those copulations fail/ You're only half that creature with two spines.\" It's as if the terrorists behind the Bible's New International Version went to work ruining Othello. Those fucksticks!  Horns smolder, handclaps bring temporary joy, sundry solos stab back and forth longer than you'd expect, but mostly Elkington keeps overreaching. \"They scheme with Caesarean smiles,\" he observes of \"The Mogul's Wives\". She was like a bearded rainbow. Elsewhere, he notices \"the wretchedness of the reptiles' rush.\" Eyes in their nipples. Awkward chuckles don't really hit till boudoir duet \"Lost Solid Colours\", when Jimbo suave's all, \"I'm so goodlooking/ Gonna tell you what you're all about/ Just a thin towel/ Keeps moving your mess around.\" Here is the dome, back with the wait, \"mess\"?
