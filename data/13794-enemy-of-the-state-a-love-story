Hell, planning to retire even before you release your first album got kinda big in 09, and Lupe was doing that before it got all trendy and shit. That's about as good a year a rapper can have while releasing almost no new music whatsoever. To cap it off? Actual music albeit just 22 minutes of it, on this mixtape that popped up in the middle of December.Maybe that needed to happen: If Lupe embodies any aspect of postKanye hiphop, it's using greater access to candor and transparency to prove himself more unlikeable with every statement he makes outside of the booth. A lot of times, it's been tough to remember that we were intrigued not because he rapped from the perspective of a cheeseburger, but rather because he simply rapped his ass off. But outside of a few blips most notably, a RZAstyled, selfsatisfied anthropomorphology of the United States tagged on to end of \"The National Anthem\" Enemy of the State tends to steer towards the latter version of Lupe with often fantastic results. It's particularly true of \"The National Anthem\": Though rappers have been sampling Radiohead since the glory days of Chino XL, for the most part, it's an olive branch to alternative nation, the easiest way to show how refined your taste in nonrap music is. Suffice to say the biggest compliment you can give is that \"Anthem\" bangs even if you've never heard one second of Kid A. It's crucial that Lupe raps with the beat as opposed to merely over it, sounding equally adept atop the bassline as he is during the hornled climax it's a great touch as his boast \"I don't think I'm best, I just think I'm better than...\" is completed by Thom Yorke singing \"...everyone.\" A question that's been raised by Enemy of the State is whether it's Lupe \"going at\" JayZ. While it's been Lupe's M.O. to mostly beef with rap bloggers, there is a notable lean on Jay's material (\"Thank You\", \"So Ghetto\") that goes beyond \"Blueprint 3 could've been something if someone else rapped over those beats.\" \"So Ghetto\" showcases Lupe's \"Food & Liquor flow\" as a kite to an incarcerated friend, and perhaps selfconsciously, \"Where I'm From\", one of Jay's gulliest tracks, gets flipped into \"Angels\", a rangy, AutoTuned love song. But elsewhere, Enemy keeps things short, vital, and mostly current: \"Back By Popular Demand\" is a fair exchange for Clipse's inclusion \"Dumb It Down\" on their Road to Til the Casket Drops mixtape, and \"The One\" is proof that DJ Khalil's beat could've been something had it not been saddled with that hook and the relentlessly personalityfree raps of Slaughterhouse. Sure, there are still plenty of times when Lupe's charmingly overreaching with his punchlines, but I wouldn't trade it considering how revitalized Lupe sounds. Though it's pretty much impossible to not be amped by the \"Final Countdown\"styled bounce of Travis Porter's \"All the Way Turnt Up\" and the yoyo synth of Lil' Wayne's \"Fireman\", the performances are potent reminders of Lupe's sheer technical prowess \"All the Way\" agreeably slouches through halftime punchlines (\"I came to take it all back like I'm Miller High Life\") and while the former cuts off at about two and a half minutes, he raps like he could go on for five times that. So, is that grade up there justifying a lack of, I dunno, ambition? Tough to say: Though a conceptual framework gave us \"Gotta Eat\", it also resulted in \"Kick, Push\". Then again, mere days after Enemy of the State dropped, you could find Lupe dedicating about as many words as there are on this tape to putting RapRadar.com on blast for god knows what. Whatever becomes of that, at least we'll have this reminder of what Lupe is capable of when he's given a mic instead of a soapbox.  "}
