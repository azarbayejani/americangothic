Lead singer Gary Lightbody's lyrics may have been more winceinducing than watching Sarah Palin go off script, yet none of it mattered when the band reached choruses so unabashedly large and humane.Though widescreen preciousness is Snow Patrol's forte, that's no reason to expect Lightbody and co. to continue bleating towards the stars forever. Arenasized anthemics have already taken the group to commercial heights scarcely imaginable when the formerly monikered Polar Bear were indiepop nobodies on Jeepster, lost in Belle and Sebastian's shadow. The band's newest album, A Hundred Million Suns, doesn't represent any drastic shift in its sonic principles, yet it's noticeably lighter on surging, megawatt stadiumfilling fare. Perhaps the newfound attention paid to nuance is just a sign of Snow Patrol's maturing, but in the record's puzzlingly diminished returns it's not hard to hear a band seemingly upping the degree of difficulty when it was just barely getting by in the first place.If A Hundred Million Suns has any hits in it at all, they're likely over and done in the album's first eight minutes. Opener \"If There's a Rocket Tie Me to It\" is Snow Patrol at their best and most emblematic, as Lightbody softens the blow of overwrought lyrics like \"the sea between us only amplifies the sound waves\" with his reliably irresistible Scottish burr, while the band crashes and explodes at his back. Second track \"Crack the Shutters\" also goes in the win column, regardless (or perhaps because) of its modest ambitions. Rhapsodizing about waking up in the morning next to a lover and wanting \"to bathe you in the light of day\" may be a fairly douchey sentiment, but keeping his lyrical concerns at such an intimate level nonetheless serves Lightbody far better than the awkward cosmic strivings that color much of the rest of the album.Sure enough, there are groaners aplenty sprinkled throughout Lightbody's lyrics, three of the most cringeworthy being: \"There's no truth at all/ Poking out at the giant eyes of ancient gods\" (from \"Lifeboats\"); \"When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills\" (\"Set Down Your Glass\"); and \"the shells crack under our shoes like punctuation points\" (\"The Planets Bend Between Us\"). There's also loads of bad planetary metaphors and overwrought cosmological bullshit that proves ohsogermane to the album's title.Still, Lightbody's tin ear wasn't such a sticking point so long as Snow Patrol routinely rolled out choruses that caught your heart in your throat. Here instead we're treated to the lightly arrhythmic Radioheadish patter of \"The Golden Floor\", the numbingly simple acoustic patterns of \"Set Down Your Glass\", as well as the likes of \"Take Back the City\" and \"Engines\", which elicit initial optimism by the sheer fact of their volume only to eschew the band's patented emotive dynamics in favor of attempting to do something Snow Patrol just simply can't manage strut.A Hundred Million Suns is rife with the sense of a band striving to be taken more seriously, whether through rocking more manfully, displaying a more sophisticated subtlety, or simply stringing together three ponderous, alreadyoverlong songs and calling the impenetrable result a 16minute standalone epic (\"The Lightning Strike\"). Snow Patrol shouldn't be expected to manufacture massappeal poprock forever, but the fact remains that the group's talents aren't yet on par with these newer, more artful ambitions. "}
