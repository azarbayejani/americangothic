The first, \"Never Alone\", is a puton a 30second slow jam that points directly to a Boyz II Men poster that may lie hidden behind an old pile of Ranger Rick magazines in Rob's closet, while the second (which follows the sublime \"Beyond Him\", a sample of the type of stuff the rest of the record will contain) is simply a thick slice of cold uncool: its title (\"Jedi Outcast\") speaks volumes, and lyrical tidbits like \"Jedi will crush the Sith\" might be a bit much to swallow, but it's important to note that this bit of scifi fandom is offered in the form of a heavy metal dirge doubletime bridge included. Obviously, if Rob gave a rat's ass about looking cool for all the kiddies, he'd shelve such excursions and offer more of the lowkey acoustic fourtrack chicanery that fills the rest of this disc. But then, why stop there? Why not cut that song about being a fucking robot (\"Kill All the Humans\") or that dreamy, reverbhappy track about the helicopter (\"Helicopter\")? What next drop the song with the Foo Fighter drumbeat about hating your job (\"Overtime\")? Introduce the cutting room floor to \"Catching the Trap\", a stopandgo track that slaps together frantic strumming and leisurely picking? The way I see it, liking Rob Crow means taking the good with the bad if you're going to groove along to the typewritten pop of \"Some Things\" and the somber meditations of \"Finger\" and especially the contagious beat of \"A Subtle Kiss\", you'll have to accept that Rob's an unabashed Star Wars fan and that he wants to share his 80s boyband homage with you. Crow's ideas come fast and furious, and it's better to give them voice and let them hit the air than squelch them for fear of them sucking. Yeah, it's a mess, but it's a glorious, expansive one. Folks that want a more concise and less willfully idiosyncratic Rob Crow can listen to Pinback; the rest of us willing to dig for diamonds will do just fine getting dirty with this. "}
