Among the first words on the intro are \"Dipset for life,\" which Santana proceeds to back up by starting an entirely new collective with dudes that will ring bells to the diehards: Un Kasa, Jim Jones... come to think of it, pretty much everyone except Cam'ron. A large part of Dipset's appeal stemmed from their ability to deadpan through every ridiculous stunt they ever pulled, and the same suspension of disbelief applies to Skull Gang. Throughout the hourplus runtime, they conduct their sexcapades in halfmilliondollar condos, haters whittle the day away opining about Skull Gang (\"Who Said That Skit\" is a musthear), hooks are built off sentiments like \"I'll kill a nigga for my chaiyeen\" delivered TPainstyle, and Young Jeezy's The Recession is seen as trenchant political commentary. Moreover, the album assumes that there's a sector of hiphop listeners that thought Cam'ron's Killa Season was too cerebral and uplifting or at least that some will cop this because Santana learned how to use AutoTune. There's even something called \"Shorty Dirt Bike Skit\" on it (lasting all of four seconds).Apparently, an integral part of growing up is having the realization that skulls aren't that cool, and following that, there's a clear lean towards naughty locker room talk just about any time you hear a woman's voice or a woman being addressed on the record, you'll probably feel bad for her. That goes for the remake of Case's mahogany slow grind \"Touch Me Tease Me\", in which the female vocal begs for her hair to be pulled in between compliments about \"smell[ing] sweeter than a daffodil\" (rhymes with a certain hygiene product) and boasts about \"your insides squishin' like a Hot Pocket.\" Same for the fake Ciara trying to sell \"Body Like a Maserati\" and its confusing metaphor about speeding tickets. If there's anything that makes it abundantly clear that Dipset are spirited if not a little misguided, \"Electric Relax\" becomes a blowjob tutorial, but I guess that's closer to its original intent than \"Peepin' My Swag\", which flips the bareknuckled grime of \"Uptown Anthem\" into a tribute about proper accessorizing.Even if reviewers are the only people to listen to this straight through, there's still plenty to enjoy \"Drama Fold\" sets the bar terribly high for Skull Gang's hilarious ignorance, as does the silly \"Got Money\" redux \"What You Reppin' (Skull Gang)\". Most of it involves Juelz growing into a lead role (\"Tony Danza, look who's the boss\"), and whether it's due to the fact that he's the most recognizable voice of the team or that he's just that much more skilled, he effortlessly steals any track he's on.It's tough to say whether this is some new beginning for Juelz, as since at least 2005 his entr√©e into pop's landscape has been through an open seat at the cokerap table if Skull Gang is infinitely more tangible than the everpostponed I Can't Feel My Face tape with Lil Wayne, it's about a fraction as anticipated. The evidence is in the perfectly competent gunclappers like \"Aggy\", lofted by a simmering sax loop, and \"Problems\", which manages to be a decent \"message\" song. But Juelz always boasts that it's more than music, and although Skull Gang have an admirable chemistry, they hew far too close to the scads of NYC mixtape lurkers to which Dipset once proved to be a far more excitable alternative.
