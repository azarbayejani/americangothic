EP","text":" Not a very sensitive name for a band, but as it was with guitarist John Chapple's former band Mclusky, nothing here should be taken too seriously. Somehow considered an EP despite containing 10 tracks (including a hidden one), Soon There Will Be... is the first release from Chapple's longstanding side project. Shooting at Unarmed Men don't sound much like Mclusky they're undeniably lofi, and neither as loud nor as frantic but they manage to withhold the volume while sounding just as distinctive. Like Ian Mackaye's recent Evens project, Soon There Will Be... veers from sloppy punk to scaledback songs, albeit gleefully brutish where their D.C. brethren were graceful. Mclusky's primary singer, Andy Falkous, crammed in syllables to convey the band's dark humor, but Chappple limits himself to concise, oneline truisms. (Everybody sing: \"Don't go fucking in the barn...\"). The approach is much the same, and his vocals are just as coarse, though he's got more than enough angst, ideas, and energy for an entire album (or EP, whatever). \"Taking Care of Business\" opens the record on a calm note, with clean upstrokes and demure drums. Mclusky's calmer moments always hit straight to the gut when coming between all the chaos, but SAUM pull the same trick without the volume. Chapple sets up an usandthem theme with lyrics about cursing the selfemployed, and an even quieter, almost poignant chorus of \"They're not as clever as we think they are.\" At first listen, it may sound like a grunge band who couldn't afford a Big Muff, but these short and sweet lofi punk songs are hymnals for young, happy drunks who woke up and found themselves in shitty 9to5s in a cubicle or a warehouse, wondering what happened. \"Taking Care of Business\" just gets all that gravitas out of the way, so \"Four Eyed McClayvie\" brings back the thrash with some of Mclusky's snide selfdeprecation (\"Can anybody cope with another song?/ Well we're gonna play one anyways\"), though fidelity holds it back from kicking up the same kind of dust as Chapple's old band. Elsewhere, the rallying cry of \"Impunity Rules\" skewers productivity goals over two galloping chords (\"40 percent means you could do a lot better\") and \"The Long and Short of It\" is delightfully inane, chanting \"I love beer\" before hunching over into a boneheaded threenote riff. \"No One Can Waltz\" is a squeaky wannabe military march and the group singalong single \"The Pink Ink\" is undeniably catchy, though from the incidental studio patter that introduces it to the shouts of \"That's the spot!\" in the chorus, it shows its cheek at every opportunity. It works, too: These songs continue Mclusky's penchant for displaying a twisted, melodic sweet tooth underneath the thrash, and that bodes well for a proper album. "}
