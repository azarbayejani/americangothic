Dropping a breakup album for your first LP seems a risky move. Listeners are just starting to get to know you, after all. But considering his last solo outing, the scrappy songsketch collection The Josiah EP, was selfreleased all the way back in 2003, maybe he had to make this record at this time. If only to get it out of his system.Jet Lag indeed has its share of emotional baggage, although it's hard to tell if it's getting unloaded, or simply repacked for a later trip. These songs are filled with observations, openended questions, and musings on postbreakup life, but with little resolution. \"The New Car\" revolves around the purchase of a vehicle to \"help with the separation,\" detailing a failed attempt to pawn a mattress as well before Wolf sighs, \"But when you told me/ That I wasted your twenties/ I didn't know what to say.\" Meanwhile, \"Unused 'I love you's build up\" in his throat in the somewhat cornily named \"The Apart Meant\", after expressing the lonely sentiment that \"For 11 years/ We didn't touch another/ And now I can't sleep,\" in \"Skull in the Ice\".Lyrically, Wolf is convincing when sticking to the griefstricken script. It's when he goes offbook that things start to get awkward. \"Master Cleanse (California)\" and \"The Opposite of Breathing\" opt for a wideeyed and spiritual tone, but their offbeat musings on praying naked in the shower and waiting for \"Thomas Edison/ With seven heads/ To come from the sea\" sound forced. Later, attempts at surrealism, like the adolescent wet dreaming detailed in \"That Kind of Man\", stumble out of the gate and suggest that Wolf doesn't share his brother's talent for crafting absurdist yarns that hold a weird carcrash fascination.If Wolf could be accused of lyrical overcompensation, the opposite could be said about the music. \"The Opposite of Breathing\" and \"The New Car\" represent the sort of competent but dull chamberpop that litters much of the record, where the jammedtogether folksy melodies of \"In the Seam\" and \"The Apart Meant\" sound less like actual songs and more like halfdecent ideas haphazardly grouped together. Listeners coming to Jet Lag expecting the bizarre pop mutations of WHY?'s 2008 careerhigh Alopecia or even its more straightforward cousin, last year's Eskimo Snow are going to be disappointed. Wearing your heart on your sleeve is one thing, but musically, Josiah Wolf isn't really taking any risks here.Nonetheless, Wolf's anguish comes over as real and consuming, and Jet Lag's highlights offer an occasionally compelling look at his darkened mindset. Opener \"The Trailer and the Truck\" stretches and yawns via elongated guitar bends and bursts of concentrated drumming, while \"Is the Body Hung\" rolls with freakfolk touches and Wolf's cracked vocals. Most affecting, however, is the spooked folk closer \"The One Sign\", in which Wolf likens a plane crash to the slow dread of uncertainty, before uttering a final epitaph: \"'Heaven help me' are just words/ That time will make you say.\" Time heals all wounds, sure. If and when Josiah Wolf decides to make another record, here's hoping he'll be newly restored by then. "}
