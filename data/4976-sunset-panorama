Silence is also with the new work that Sweden a completely important instrument, though this is not to be equated under any circumstances with nothing. Logh work thereby, build on it. Google's builtin translator explains: Dirge, slow, ice falling rock shelves. But, global warming is imminent. America on Glacier National Park will no longer, you know. The hills across the valley of Logh were long and white. I say: On this, their third plate (oops, Babelfish again), Logh have created yet another sparse, precise slowcore epic with colossally imbecilic SwedishintoEnglish lyrics. On \"Destinymanifesto\" (yes, one word), singer/guitarist Mattias Friberg whispers, emowise, \"Destiny's dead/ I cut its head off.\" On \"The Big Sleep\" (nothing like Chandler's L.A.!) he adds, \"Beauty hides in your eyes\" and \"I'm heavier than a broken heart.\" No, really. On aptly titled \"Bring on the Ether\": \"Time is the enemy,\" which was my 12thgrade mantra thanks to MxPx. On \"Asymmetric Twins\": \"I wrote a letter to the king and queen\" and \"I set sail for the mystery in life\" and the glockenspiel goes do, do, do. Shall I compare thee to a winter's day in the land of the morning sun? There is a song notable because it's a song and not one average guitar lick repeated over and over and turned into an instrumental, like the album's opening and closing tracks called \"Trace Back the Particle\", which goes nuclear over the album's frosty, windchapped landscape. It's something to wake you up, at least. The album comes with a DVD of the band recording the album (live), complete with 5.1 surround. Watch the ice caps melt! With a Dolby sound system! What fun! Remember Sigur RÃ³s? OK, of course you do. Remember Appleseed Cast? Well, maybe, yeah, fine. Remember Waxwing? Exactly. On second thought, good thing it snowed in Manhattan last night, turning my little apartment building into a Nordic ziggurat, or else I might have graded this Scandinavian paintbynumbers too harshly.
