Almost as if it were a challenge, the two decided to make a throwback synthpop artist the centerpiece of their mix while kneedeep in reggae, dancehall, and hiphop.Â Enter UK duo La Roux, who make catchy, demonstrative synthpop that's nonetheless brittle, stiff, and exceedingly pale.Lazerproof takes instrumental and vocal tracks from La Roux's heavily 80sindebted album and brazenly mashes them up with beats and rhymes that are almost wholly uptotheminute hip, encompassing rap, R&B, dancehall, and dubstep. Surprisingly, it often works, thanks to singer Elly Jackson. She's a dramatic, expressive vocalist, and it seems likely the real reason Major Lazer thought a mindmeld with La Roux sounded like a good idea was because Diplo and Switch knew her voice could still sound great even outside synthpop strictures. The blend of La Roux's \"Fascination\" with \"Keep It Goin' Louder\", a standout from Major Lazer's own 2009 debut, Guns Don't Kill People Lazers Do, is a seamless success, as is the recasting of formerly plinky \"Quicksand\" as a slice of squelchy, steel drumblessed dance bliss.At its best, Major Lazer's reimagining lends pathos to La Roux, a quality the synthpoppers were only sporadically interested in conveying on their own album. The mixtapeopening \"Bulletproof (Nacey Remix)\" boldly takes La Roux's best song and turns it into something stark and haunting, full of strings and portentous piano chords. Likewise, the succeeding track powerfully weds Jackson's turn on La Roux's \"Colourless Colour\" to the delicate shuffle of Ken Boothe's classic ska hearttugger, \"Artibella\". This formula nets further rewards on the tape's blendings of \"As If By Magic\" with Demarco's melancholic \"Fallen Soldiers,\" and \"Growing Pains\" with Drake's \"Houstonatlantavegas\".Hotwiring Jackson's hysterics to thudding beats works perfectly, but Lazerproof mostly falters when trying to shoehorn rappers and reggae spitters into the equation. That's not to say a great mix can't be woven from the likes of Gucci Mane, Amanda Blank, or upandcoming female emcee Candi Redd, but the effect of trying to nestle any of their grittily profane verses against Jackon's steely androgyny is just too jarring to work. Unlike slangier, more musically polymorphous former Diplo tape subjects M.I.A. and Santigold, Jackson doesn't play well with others. At least Major Lazer have proven she looks good with a tan. "}
