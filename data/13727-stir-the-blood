So the Bravery are just about the last quasibig rock band anyone might expect to come within downtown sneering distance of a noteworthy hit by a bona fide pop starlet. But here we are: Sam Endicott, frontman for these oftabused New York electrorockers, cowrote Shakira's Italocrazed \"She Wolf\". He didn't, however, write the lyrics.New Orderstyle bass lines like the one on \"She Wolf\" could practically be the story of this guy's career. They anchored the Killerslite dancerock of the Bravery's selftitled 2005 debut particularly its best song, \"Honest Mistake\" and turned scarce when the band dialed back the synths for rootsier wannabeBrit mope on disastrous 2007 followup, The Sun and the Moon. While that synthpop bounce is back on Stir the Blood, so are the group's shortcomings. Some are familiar, and some are worse than even the most hardened mid2000s NME skeptics could've anticipated.Endicott's voice still alternates between operatic Ian Curtis croon (remember Elefant?) and adenoidal Robert Smith whine (remember Stellastarr*?). He still sings songs that manage to evoke greats from bygone eras without any of the greatness: \"Baby, we were born to be adored,\" repeats glumly hooky synthrock opener \"Adored\", neatly desecrating the most famous choruses from Bruce Springsteen and the Stone Roses in a single refrain. \"Born again\" stomper \"Song for Jacob\" contains a sideways allusion to the Smiths' Louder Than Bombs, and makeout anthem of sorts \"She's So Bendable\" has that \"How Soon Is Now\" guitar wobble. Somadropping dystopia \"I Have Seen the Future\" in which the band accurately concedes, \"I am a nerve ending without a brain\" might as well be called \"I have become aware of the title and primary neologism from Brave New World.\" Druggy (I guess?) finale \"Sugar Pill\" avers, \"I am blissed out/ I have kaleidoscope eyes.\"  Shakira this isn't.\"She Wolf\" collaborator John Hill, who coproduced Santigold's excellent debut album, doesn't seem to have been much help sonically, either. Someone clinically extracts whatever trace of messy humanity made it through the first time the Bravery worked the nuwave shtick, on their debut; Stir the Blood is a parodoxically bloodless listen. In another evolution of the band's sound, lead guitarist Michael \"Moose\" Zakarin now tops the cookiecutter chord progressions with needlessly frilly progmetal solos. See \"Hatefuck\", which gives the band's previous womanunfriendly tendencies a shrill, witless apotheosis (\"No one can hear you here\" hey, wasn't that part of a David Spade dirtballcomedy routine?). As if that weren't enough to get us all excited, there's utterly unremarkable first single \"Slow Poison\": \"Burn, burn, house on fire/ I'm so sick and tired.\" It goes on like this. "}
