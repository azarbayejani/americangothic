{"label":" 5RC","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/1823/homepage_large.a26c5908.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Mia Lily Clarke","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Sur La Mer Samp-Le-Mer","text":" While Slim Moon's Kill Rock Stars has held a longtime place as one of the most progressive and independentminded imprints in underground music, Moon's subsidiary and predominantly noisebased label, 5 Rue Christine (formed in 1997, and named after the Parisian address of Gertrude Stein), has also been fitted for an indie crown in recent months. Over the past year alone, 5RC has released acclaimed albums by the Mae Shi, NoNeck Blues Band, and Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice. With such an impressive roster of artists, it isn't surprising that Moon chose to celebrate 5RC's progress with a compilation. It's apt that the first 5RC compilation should highlight Deerhoof the San Francisco quartet were the first band to sign to the label, and have stuck by it even as their has popularity soared. They're the only group to have two spots on the 17track SampLeMer: \"Running Thoughts\", which appeared on The Runners Four, and a previously unreleased recording, \"ChiTan First Guitar\". The latter is a brief, lofi track built around subtle guitars, a minimal vocal line that repeats the word \"meow\" in Japanese, wheezy segments of harmonium, and the brisk twang of a sitar. Like the other 10 unreleased tracks on this comp, it doesn't stand up to the band's other recordings. Need New Body's \"Endless Sky in the Mind's Eye\" is also underwhelming when compared to last year's intriguingly opaque album Where's Black Ben?, a vicious instrumental soundscape. The Planet The's disjointed, rhythmically textured postpunk and the dilapidated marching beat of the Punks' \"We Are the Shit, Part 2\" are previously unreleased tracks that go toetotoe with these artists' other work. Far more effective in this compilation, and saving it from becoming crippled by songs that were deemed too weak to make it on to a \"proper\" release, are the tracks by Xiu Xiu (\"\"), Hella (\"Madonna Approaches R&B Blonde Wreckages\"), the Mae Shi (\"Remarkable Dirty Animals\"), and BARR (\"My List of Demands\"). Quality aside, SampLeMer is first and foremost a document and celebration of 5RC's brief history. Moon may not provide a flawless run of tracks, one that represents the individual strengths of the groups on his imprint, but this collection still serves as evidence of the label's diversity and devotion to exciting, genrecrossing music.Â  "}
