Faded Seaside Glamour and You See Colours were overlooked albums of gorgeous, sunstroked pop that was equally informed by dance and shoegaze, often and rather accurately likened to a Cocteaus/La's crossbreed. But there's so much about them that comes across as earnest to the point of unintentional silliness in no particular order, their videos, their lyrics, and their haircuts. And even if Greg Gilbert's voice is an astonishing instrument, he sounds like a woman half the time, and when he tries to grit it up in the lower registers, he suspiciously sounds like a Bonus Jonas. That's actually relevant to the discussion, because I used to wonder how \"Valentine\" or \"Hey Girl\" could fall under the radar in the golden age of Poptimism, when grown men are falling over themselves trying to unearth the \"genius\" in Disney pop outside of its marketing. But after hearing \"When You Look Me In The Eyes\" while getting my hair cut and then \"One More Lie In\" and \"Keep It Simple\" in the car immediately afterwards... well, the two might actually be playing the same game at this point. Bet you can't tell which is penning these lyrics: \"I love you/ I'll pick the leaves from trees above you.\" \"I know what haunts you/ And you need to know I want you.\" \"You need to try today/ Because these things don't go away.\" Where the Cocteaus looked to obscure, the brothers Gilbert makes themselves fully intelligible, and at Everything's The Rush's worst, you get wincing simulacra of 1990s \"sell out\" pop ballads whose sheer inanity was tough to anticipate even when Delays were at their corniest. Everything's The Rush provides convenient scapegoats, specifically the decision to let keyboardist Aaron Gilbert sing; I'll stop short of namedropping CCR's Mardi Gras as a comparison, but not by much. Harmonically, he's a great fit with his brother and it's hard to imagine \"Hey Girl\" or \"Nearer Than Heaven\" having got as close to the cosmos without him. But as a lead, his froggy everybloke accent strips the band of their most distinguishing characteristic, not to mention all of the lyrics I mentioned before are his. Aaron fairs better on the clubby stomper \"Friends Are False\", but that might have to do more with Greg murdering him on his own shit once the hook kicks in.  Or you can blame the guy behind the boards if you must; the majority of their past work was headed by Graham Sutton of Bark Psychosis, who always managed to make even the most synthetic of their numbers sound humble and handcrafted. For their major label debut, they recruited Youth, who's always fallen a hair shy of Bruckheimer overkill, but tellingly has enabled gargantuas of ego such as Richard Ashcroft, Liam Gallagher, and, if we're to believe the rumors, Axl Rose. Whereas the past saw the group trafficking in coy \"Do you love me? Check yes\" mash notes, too many moves here feel like the desperate begging for a lastminute prom date this is the rare band where real strings sound less appropriate than fake ones, and while they add a nice touch to the surprisingly tender \"Pieces\", \"Touch Down\", and \"Keep It Simple\" end up sounding like Pavlovian biscuits of phony populism.  But Everything's The Rush isn't without its charms even if they do surface less frequently. Along with the Rapture, they're one of the few bands that can legitimately make rock music applicable to dancefloors without the middlemen of disco remixers. \"Girl's on Fire\" and \"Friends Are False\" in particular hurtle with a heady velocity that makes their underwriting feel almost necessary. Meanwhile, knowing that \"Hooray\" is about Gilbert's OCD is about as important as knowing \"Valentine\" was supposedly about Hurricane Katrina which is to say, not at all. It's an overwhelming, irrepressibly cheerful refrain from a band that seems to have an endless supply of them; even \"One More Lie In\" redeems itself at its chorus. But Everything's The Rush often feels like one of those stock characters that tries to play ditzy so it can hang with the popular kids before eventually being loved for what they are. Their previous albums ensure they'll deserve it if Everything's The Rush manages to break them into a higher tax bracket; I just hope they don't see it as a mandate for more of the same.  "}
