Deusner","artist":"Chad VanGaalen","title":"Infiniheart","text":" Maybe this is just an American's projection onto our northerly neighbors, but I imagine Chad VanGaalen knows the cold very intimately. He hails from Calgary, where he busked street corners and subways for years, gradually building up a large catalog of original songs. Using a variety of instruments and equipment some of which he's fashioned by hand the relentless DIY'er has recorded hundreds of his songs in a makeshift studio in his bedroom, where you can imagine him retreating from a frigid evening. On his debut album, Infiniheart, which was released in Canada earlier this year and which Sub Pop is now releasing domestically, that crisp chill hangs over every chiming note and every booming beat. Even the packaging cannot escape the cold front: Snowwhite and iceblue dominate the cover artwork, and the inner sleeve is windchapped pink. This chilliness suggests an album full of spare, soft songs conveying subtle emotions, which is accurate but only to a degree. While he keeps his accompaniment to a minimum, VanGaalen is no minimalist. His songs are balanced with only a few carefully chosen elements, as if he has expended a great deal of energy trying to avoid adding another instrument here or overworking a beat there. But the range of sounds on Infiniheart is impressively wide: When VanGaalen culled these 16 from the hundreds in his vault, he chose with an ear toward the eclectic, showcasing his musical ingenuity.  In fact, there's an almost maximalist spectrum of sound on Infiniheart, and the album is all the more impressive for creating and maintaining such a specific mood over 16 songs. Brushes stir against snares on \"Blood Machine\" imitating slow respiration, and the prismatic guitars of \"Liquid + Light\" and \"Somewhere I Know There Is Nothing\" evoke the cutting cold in the air and the sharp glare of sunlight off frozen snow. On \"1000 Pound Eyelids\" a bleary trumpet suggests the bending metal and breaking bones of a car crash, and the sharp notes of a dobro and a breezy penny whistle pierce \"Sunshine Snare Hits\". VanGaalen's guitar can be gentle or brutal, his beats reserved or ostentatious, and he has sequenced the album to showcase this dynamic. The twoguitar coda of \"Kill Me in My Sleep\", which is perhaps best described as \"gossamer\", is immediately followed by the instrumental \"J.C.'s Head on the Cross\", which bounces frenetically on thudding beats. He sings these songs in a voice that stretches towards a shivering falsetto, which cracks noticeably on \"Chronograph #1\" and adds to the otherworldliness of \"Red Blood\" and the videogamey \"The Warp Zone/Hidden Bridge\". If this chilliness enlivens the music, it unfortunately dampens VanGaalen's songwriting, which relies too heavily on weighty, scifi concepts that seem frozen and immobile. In theory, such reliance suggests a unique vision, unflinching in its conception and execution, but in practice, he too often sounds coldly remote, more aloof than elusive. \"Clinically Dead\" starts the album with the demise of a manmachine: \"Clinically he was dead, and the modem inside his head was still working.\" Conceptually, it recalls the Flaming Lips (who based an entire album on the heartbreaking inner conflict of a crimefighting cartoon) and Grandaddy (who based an entire album on the melding of humanity and machines in a postapocalyptic world), but those artists play with the distance between their subject matter and the emotions they intend to communicate. Very rarely does any selfawareness come through on Infiniheart. When his flights of fancy are anchored in the actual, Infiniheart becomes a powerful combination of words and music. \"After the Afterlife\" asks about such mundane matters as a mother's haircut and a father's drug habit before conjuring eerie seaweed imagery that hints at tragedy. And \"Chronograph #1\", about a party whose guest of honor is noticeably absent, possesses more gravity than any of his oddball lyrics. But still, those cumbersome songs stand out the most, especially \"Blood Machine\", which imagines a Matrixlike underworld where everyone is hooked up to a \"giant machine that could circulate blood.\" He tries to connect it to larger, existential issues, but despite the fluttering guitarwork, the song falls flat: \"One of them explained to me/ how they used to be free/ Before the machines got built/ And before there were laws regulating free will.\" To his credit, VanGaalen invests those clunky lines with a vocal intensity that's surprisingly graceful and even poignant. That's ultimately the sticking point with Infiniheart: VanGaalen's songs tend toward folly, yet it's impossible to discount his commitment to the material.  "}
