At the sight of the ranch house, he sighs with relief and leaves his tired horse at the edge of the porch. His spurs clank with each footfall, and he notes the damage done to his fancy new boots as he trudges up the stairs. At the door, he reacquaints himself with his reflection in the window, and knocks. \"Come on in.\" He enters, and sees his employer, Gar Price, fumbling with a small black box. \"You seen these?\" asks Gar. \"CD player.\" \"You wanted to ask me something, boss?\" \"Yeah, yeah.\" Gar mutters, offers a box of cigars. \"Smoke?\" \"Don't mind if I do.\" Brady strikes a match against the heel of his boot. \"You wanted to see me.\" \"Well, Brady, I got this new CD for the newfangled phonograph there. Band called Little Grizzly. Texas boys. Ever heard of them?\" \"I reckon I haven't,\" says Brady. \"It's these four renegade cowboys from up round Denton. Leader's George Neal and he's got some real city slickin' ways about him. I think that's mighty suspicious.\" \"Yessir.\" \"I'll be damned if I know what to make of this music. I know you're something of an educated man, Brady, and I was wonderin' if you could make heads or tails of this.\" Gar pushes a button on the black box and the room floods with music. Five cigars and six Tequizas later, after a long period of critical evaluation interspersed with Gar' onesided conversation about upkeep on the ranch, Brady offers, \"I gotta admit, I like that George Neal feller's vocals. He sounds like Wayne Coyne with a Western tinge. Hand over that case... yeah, this song's called 'Today Is the Day.' I like that part at the chorus where things start to sound a little more like a sloppy Flaming Lips. That's a good thing, by the way. \"And the lyrics ain't bad, really. Sorta funny and absurd and poignant at the same time. Like on 'Charlotte,' which seems to be about a robot, though I ain't sure. That song may be more your speed. Shows more of its countryroots. Just George Neal and an acoustic guitar.\" \"Right pretty,\" says Gar. \"There's a coupla waltzes on this disc,\" replies Brady. \"The first, 'I Though I Knew Better Than That,' is louder but, if you don't mind me sayin', the undue twang makes it sound like novelty. The second, 'Mockingbird Glasses,' is a whole other story. Feels antiquated. Even the lyrics allude to a sort of sepiatoned past of 'Mockingbird glasses, torn waistcoat and glasses, and old movie posters.' The organ work is nice in this song. Adds character to the song without overwhelming the other instruments, and I tell you what, sir, that's becoming a rarity these days. This George Neal is a heckuva multiinstrumentalist.\" \"City slicker,\" Gar responds. \"What'd I tell you?\" \"Well, boss, listen up here in 'Sleep Foreign Engine.' It's a sad sort of antilullaby. Good song, but the real high point comes with the horn section about halfway through...\" \"Son, I don't know what in tarnation you're talking about.\" \"I'll sum up: Little Grizzly writes countryflavored indie pop with more of an edge, than say, Jay Farrar's last album. They're not afraid to turn up the amps and rock Uncle Tupelostyle when the time is right, but it seems somehow wrong to keep drawing comparisons to altcountry bands. With few exceptions \"Charlotte, \"Mockingbird Glasses\" their best stuff comes when they keep the country to a minimum. And the worst tracks on the album \"I Knew Better Than That,\" \"Drum Major\" show the downhome flavor getting the better of George Neal. Over the top dialect and affectation only go so far. Consider, for example, this review. \"On the whole, it's a pretty good 'compact disc.' They take a fairly basic formula you've prob'ly heard before and make it sound reasonably fresh. Some songs are so catchy, they feel almost like guilty pleasures. I say give it a try or two. It'll probably grow on you.\" \"Well, I thank you, Brady,\" says Gar, \"but I think it's about time we wrap this up.\" \"Yes, sir, I reckon so. But how?\" Gar's head turns into that of a goat's, and his hands become like giant katana blades. Brady's boss has revealed his true identity. And now, he speaks, with a voice that is as thunder. \"I am the demon lord, Abadon. Embrace Satan!\" Quickly, he plunges his mighty katanahands into Brady, who can only utter, \"If you don't mind my sayin' so, I certainly did not see that comin', sir.\" Whereupon Abadon feasts upon the lifeless flesh of his employee until he finally bursts into several smaller demons and disappears through the walls.
