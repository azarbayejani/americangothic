After the departure of cofounding member Larissa Loyva, P:ano's remaining threesome have returned as No Kids, changing course from 2005's ukuleledriven Ghost Pirates Without Heads for a debut that rivals the Dirty Projectors' The Getty Address in its artsaturated omnivorousness, though its appetites aren't always within its means. On Come Into My House, everything from presentday urban radio to kitchensink chamberpop to college glee clubs serve as fodder for F. Scott Fitzgeraldesque depictions of effete East Coast student loneliness. This old beach house is an extravagant one, peopled by characters who probably weren't hurt by the housingmarket slump. Plenty of indie pop bands borrow from 1960s Motown, but No Kids' appropriation of contemporary r&b puts them in a lineage that runs from Orange Juice's Chicstyle guitars and Scritti Politti's soulful balladry to Hot Chip's selfaware electropop and, alas, labelmate Hey Willpower's unFutureSexy Timberlake sounds, too. When the compositions are as engaging as the intricate percussion, as on advance mp3s like pianobased malefemale duet \"For Halloween\" or the falsettofrosted \"The Beaches All Closed\", songwriter Nick Krgovich conjures a world of empty vacation homes and full scrapbooks. The TPainesque AutoTuning on \"Listen For It/Courtyard Music\" comes off as an eccentricity next to what sounds like bassoon, but Krgovich's protagonists have eccentricities instead of girlfriends. \"Neighbour's Party\" interpolates the slinky piano riff from Amerie's \"Crush\" as if it were a sample; the obviousness of the reference is a painful reminder that Amerie would be a lot more fun to hear blasting from your neighbor's party. Of course, No Kids know this, too. \"It's a dance in my heart,\" Krgovich and Julia Chirka sing not a night in the club. Opener \"Great Escape\" describes \"wandering around the gardens on this great estate\" with the band's Jimmy JamTerry Lewis fascination hidden behind lush orchestration, marchingband drum rolls, and quiet wistfulness. When the time comes for celebration on \"I Love the Weekend\" or \"Old Iron Gate\", Krgovich's melismas flit over Brazilian rhythms instead of icyhot r&b. \"Four Freshmen Locked Out as the Sun Goes Down\" sets barbershopstyle harmonies atop unobtrusive strums. Lyrical mentions of uppercrust academic life are about as frequent here as musical allusions to the pop charts.  In Fitzgerald novels like The Beautiful and Damned, the characters may come from the WASP elite, but their passions burn like the booze in which they can't help but overindulge. Come Into My House represents another side of paradise the yearning of the welltodo young intellectual who doesn't do well when it comes to matters of the heart, the insider who finds himself on the outside (with his pockets full of saltwater taffy). The album could use a little more of Fitzgerald's fiery extremes, and a bit less of meandering disappointments like \"You Looked Good to Me\" or \"Dancing in the Stacks\", but at its best it's a clever piece of musical storytelling by a band unintimidated by genre.
