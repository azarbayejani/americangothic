But during a worrisome stretch for the WuTang Clan that year, he seemed among the most likely to survive and even thrive if the Clan ceased to exist as a functioning group. Largely selfproduced and forgoing any Alisters (UGod doesn't count), the album harbored no delusions about what it was meant to provide Deck ripping through one simileladen verse after another with beats that stayed out his way. But since then, his falloff has been dramatic, as he's rattled off increasingly lessnoticed solo drops and sounded wholly uninspired on higherprofile Wurelated releases (remember \"keep it fresh like Tupperware\" from 8 Diagrams?). It was easy to view last year's \"House Nigga\" as some sort of nadir, Deck spending five minutes dissing Joe Budden for his Internet fame. This was the guy whom even GZA was scared of following on \"Triumph\"?A more positive approach is to see the song as Deck's attempt to find his place in a galaxy of faded NYC stars; the wise ones realize they're not competing with Drake. At the outset, Deck seems aware of what could constitute a solid 2010 release on his part. Though the ringside samples of \"The Champion\" are beyond played, he still lets off rounds of impressively pugilistic internal rhyme. Meanwhile, the Obamaquoting \"Born Survivor\" continues the lowkey revival of Cormega and reveals the image Deck wants to create for himself here, a grindoriented street soldier not all that far removed from latterday dead prez albums. They called it \"revolutionary but gangsta,\" while Inspectah boasts, \"Still I'm quick to pop it off/ With the model broads or the Molotovs.\"But as Manifesto runs through its forbidding 20track playlist, it unsurprisingly falters when it chases Hot 97 spins that are laughably out of reach. The aluminum handclaps of \"We Get Down\" evoke a GUnit beat so generic that even Tony Yayo would take pause, \"T.R.U.E.\" is a limp rap&B overture for empire states of mind, and \"The Big Game\" is saddled with a cornball hook of a nonmetaphor that can't fully commit to AutoTune. And while the relationship songs of Uncontrolled Substance offered an occasional glimpse behind Deck's otherwise stoic veneer, \"Luv Letter\" comes awfully close to Murs at his most needy.But worse than the blind fumbling for hits is hearing what sounds like an average MC doing an uncanny Inspectah Deck impersonation. It's disorienting to hear him put such conviction behind subpar getthatpaper rhymes. And while Raekwon, Billy Danze, and Kurupt hold serve, \"Brothaz Respect\" houses quite possibly the most embarrassingly offbeat Cappadonna guest spot to date (and I've heard The Yin and the Yang), and too much of Manifesto is turned over to aggressively average foot soldiers like Fes Taylor and the indefensiblynamed Carlton Fisk.Look, it's no fun to criticize Deck for reaching for that brass ring. You can't help but think he realizes this disconnect during \"This Is It\", where he counters those who think he's slipped by boasting of \"A million kids thinkin' he rich/ A million bitches think he the shit.\" Sadly, it shows how the dynamic's been reversed for Inspectah Deck since Enter the WuTang (36 Chambers) you sit there and watch him play himself, knowing he's lying.
