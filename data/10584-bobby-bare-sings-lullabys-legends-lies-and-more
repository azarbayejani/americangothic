Deusner","artist":"Bobby Bare","title":"Bobby Bare Sings Lullabys, Legends & Lies (And More)","text":"  Shel Silverstein is a master of the aabb rhyme scheme, which is too often abused by unimaginative or naïve musicians. In his poetry and his songwriting not that there's that much distinction between the two he uses seemingly simplistic lineending rhymes to underscore his fanciful ideas, whimsical humor, and gentle subversion. For example, the colloquial cadence and limerick line rhythms in this description of Paul Bunyan's sexual appetite downplay the bawdy and emphasize the comic: Well, you talk about women, that man's so lusty Needs a woman every hour just to keep from gettin' rusty And the young ones run and the old ones crawl... To Paul That song, unassumingly titled \"Paul\", first appeared on Silverstein's 1968 album Dirty Feet, but the definitive take comes from the bestselling 1973 album Bobby Bare Sings Lullabys, Legends & Lies, the first of several collaborations between the two musicians, recently reissued in a 2xCD Legacy Edition. Despite the absence of his name on the spine, Silverstein is as much a presence on this album as Bare, for he provides everything in the title but \"Bare\" and \"Sings\" (and \"&\", if you want to get technical). The title track supplies a pretty matteroffact introduction to this concept album: \"Gather 'round ladies, come sit at my feet/ I'll sing about warm sunny skies/ There's mermaids and beans and lovin' machines/ In my lullabys, legends, and lies.\"  Of course that song ends in a singalong, and of course the lyrics are true to their word: the baker's dozen tracks that follow all penned by Silverstein tell of voodoo witches, mermaid lovers, mechanical women, barroom brawlers, and, of course, gigantic lumberjacks. The tone alternates persuasively between the gleefully silly (\"The Mermaid\", \"True Story\") and the gently mournful (\"Rosalie's Good Eats Café\"), which has as much to do with Bare's vocals as Silverstein's words. His singularly laidback singing style, at once relaxed and expressive, fits these songs perfectly, never overselling their childlike appeal nor diluting their emotional weight. Even 34 years after its release, it still plays like the best hippie redneck adult children's album ever made.  \"Daddy What If\" is the aural equivalent of cuteoverload.com, with fiveyearold Bobby Bare Jr. (making his recording debut) subbing for snuggly animals. Both Silverstein and Bare seem to have realized that at the time country music was one of the few genres that could traffic in such unabashed sentimentality and not come across as mawkish or condescending. In this context, songs like \"Daddy What If\" or \"In the Hills of Shiloh\" (about Civil War widows) or \"The Wonderful Soup Stone\" (about imagination as a salve for hard times) are all the more poignant for having no ulterior ironies or subtext of any kind. As a result, they are able to address the child in every adult while respecting the adult in every child.  A second disc collects the duo's later collaborations, culling mostly from Bare's subsequent albums and striking the same balance between humorous and ruminative. \"Singin' in the Kitchen\" features Bare, his wife, and their children banging on pots and pans; \"$100,000 in Pennies\" recounts the travails of the world's unluckiest bank robber. By contrast, \"Sylvia's Mother\", a hit for Bare as well as for Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show, is a conversation between Sylvia's mother and Sylvia's heartbroken exlover, and the confines of the concept the hesaid, shesaid structure, the prechorus announcement from the operator keep the emotions immediate but understated.  Inspired by the local hullabaloo following Lester Flatt's death, but now relevant to any country singer older than 60, \"Rough on the Living\" is one of the most powerful examinations of Music Row's curious disdain for and veneration of its legends: \"They didn't want him around when he's livin',\" Bare sings achingly and accusingly, \"but he's sure a good friend when he's dead.\" It's hard not to miss the irony the song has accrued over the years: Despite the successes of Lullabys, Legends & Lies and subsequent hit albums, both Silverstein, who died in 1999, and Bare are better known outside of Nashville, as a children's author and an altcountry icon, respectively. But this reissue is a good reminder that they once charmed the city with complex compositions that still sound like the simplest of pleasures.  "}
