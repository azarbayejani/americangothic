The 27yearold glitchpop experimentalist shares his European record label and broadminded view of pop with Shugo Tokumaru, but the Frenchman's recordings are more frenetic and electronicbased than those of his Japanese peer (who has only mellowed since 2004 breakthrough Night Piece). On third proper fulllength Monolith, released in the U.S. by Portland's Audio Dregs, O.Lamm overextends himself even further but more like a slinky than a bungee cord, so hooray no bloodshed.It'd probably only be video game bloodshed, anyway. Monolith MarioPaints laptop breakbeats, Jpop bleeps, and, somewhere, a Gameboy version of a Melvins riff into a delightfully seizureinducing fantasy. The princess is in this castle, starting with Lullatone's Yoshimi Tomida on kaleidoscopic doremi opener \"La Chasse Aux Oiseaux\". The real prize, however, is \"Open Malice\", featuring Paris trio Konki Duet's Zoe Wolf sounding beguilingly listless on a bassheavy track that's brainy/zany enough for a dream collab between Cornelius and the Blow. \"Genius Boy\" casts another Konki Dueter, Kumi Okamoto, in a Hypercolor aural cartoon. Oh, and Momus raps spitting words like \"malarkey\" darkly on ominous cutandpaste \"Syllabus of Errors\".O.Lamm mixes in some organic sounds, too. Sampled strings and disembodied vocal snippets drive the electrofunk plot of \"The Macguffin\". The wife of the computer voice from \"Fitter Happier\" gives way to trebly acoustic guitar on \"Silviphoebia\", while musicbox chimes and spacedout synths help mask a melody that's awkardly like \"Good King Wenceslas\". Sometimes O.Lamm follows his whims too far, as on \"Electric Emily\", an allusion to a William Vollmann story with yipping samples and murky percussion that irritate more than they exhilarate.Since O.Lamm's whole deal is pixie stickfueled excess jerky beats moving onto the next idea without ever quite settling into an easy groove his occasional excess excesses are pretty easily forgiveable. But I still can't help drooling over what he'd sound like if forced to work within more conventionally songoriented limits, as he does here on \"Open Malice\" or on first YouTube video \"Aerialist\", which strings together enough vocal snippets to nearly resemble conventional verses. Monolith ends with a succession of voices, each asking, \"Julie, what's the matter?\" Dudes, this time I have no idea. "}
