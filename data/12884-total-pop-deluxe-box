Deluxe Box","text":" When Erasure released Pop! The First 20 Hits in 1992, it was a greatesthits that was practically a boast: 20 consecutive singles, almost every one of them a significant UK hit. After darting from project to project for the first half of the 1980s, songwriter/synth dude Vince Clarke had finally formed a lasting partnership (with Andy Bell, whose voice still sounds uncannily like Clarke's old Yaz partner Alison Moyet). If they didn't have the range and wit of Pet Shop Boys, the other major homophilic synthpop duo of their era, they had all the hooks anyone could ask for, and they damn sure had a flashier singer even minor singles like \"You Surround Me\" let Bell show off his postBoy George soul chops and stratospheric falsetto. Clarke's treblerange synthesizers sound chintzy and fakey now; that's how they sounded at the time, too, but that was their purpose to be the sound of the prefabricated future. Pop!'s final song (not counting a remix of \"Who Needs Love [Like That]\") was a cover of ABBA's \"Take a Chance on Me\" that gave the game away: Clarke's dream was to be Benny and Bj√∂rn rolled into one, a technician of irresistible, precisiontooled camp. (The earlier Erasure single \"Stop!\" had basically been a diagonal crosssection of \"Take a Chance on Me\", too.)Total Pop! is an expansion of Pop!, beginning with the original album in toto. That collection represented Erasure's first seven years; it's taken another 17 to generate enough material for a second disc's worth of singles. The strict chronology means that disc two leads with its one bona fide jewel: 1994's \"Always\", blessed with an upwardspiraling melody that justifies the \"Like a Prayer\" choir behind Bell. But that year was also when they started following the trends of electronic music (\"Run to the Sun\") rather than cheerfully ignoring them, and since then they've trudged through all the requisite careerextenders: the flaccid hopeyoulikeournewdirection experiment (1995's Erasure), the guessyoupreferredourolddirection backtrack (1997's Cowboy), the album of obvious covers (2003's Other People's Songs seriously, \"Solsbury Hill\"?), the acousticversionsofoldstuff album (2006's Union Street). The later singles are superficially very much like the early ones; the difference is that Clarke's electronics have come to mostly just underscore Bell's singing, rather than engage it with countermelodies and crossrhythms.And then there's the third disc, \"Live 19872007\", which adds little besides room tone, slightly different arrangements and the occasional bit of crowd noise to Erasure's studio recordings their live performances are long on spectacle (hence the DVD also included with the set) but short on revelation. There's yet another installment in their string of ABBA covers, \"Voulez Vous\" (preceded by an a cappella verse of \"Mamma Mia\"); there's yet another version of \"Who Needs Love\", this time from 1996, accompanied by wildly inapposite live drums and chugging guitars. (Oh, the 90s.)Clarke's gift as a songwriter is his sense of melody, which hasn't entirely deserted him 2007's \"Sunday Girl\" (not a Blondie cover) delivers the goods almost as much as anything on the original Pop! But Erasure has never quite pulled off the vulnerable universality and radiant ache that gave their Swedish idols depth and staying power. An hour's worth of their hits is about all it's possible to take before sugarcrash sets in. A second bestof disc two, in other words would've been a useful if lesser companion to the first; confining it to this bloated box makes it considerably less fun. "}
