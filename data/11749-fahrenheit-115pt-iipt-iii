In hiphop, especially. In the wake of Summer '05's Houston gurgle and the Winter's critical crackhop resurgence, there are many people hoping for a return to brighter, looser days this Spring. A rebirth of sorts, where something old is something new again. There's a palpable unrest on the Okayplayer Message Boards and elsewhere, blindly searching for a Native Tongues revival or at least something approximating Rawkus' dazzlingly brief resurrection of it half a decade later.There's probably only three ways you'd know much about nextofNativekin Lupe Fiasco: His exuberant guest spot on Kanye West's \"Touch the Sky\", the Chicago MC's regional skateboarderseducing smash \"Kick, Push\", or the internet. But the pitch on him is as exhausting as it is clich√©: Clever, conscious kid to save hiphop from the perils of bling kings and criminalminded malcontents. If you approach this multilayered, Shawn Carterapproved young artist's music with that kind of withering outlook on hiphop, you're liable to be disappointed. There aren't enough QTips in the world to clear that crevice. What Lupe does offer is a canny array of wordplay and an ear for snappish production. This group of mixtapes is a collection of freestyles and originals that comprise Fahrenheit 1/15, named for a corner in his neighborhood, and read like a trek through his life: Islam, geekdom, resistance to sinning, local turbulence, political unrest.One of Lupe's gifts is his malleability; he sounds as comfortable spitting hard, metaphysical poetics over Nas' \"Thief's Theme\" as doing acrobatics over chipmunked \"Revenge of the Nerds\" theme music. On Part 1 Fiasco samples his Chicago forebear's \"Jesus Walks\" for an extended treatise, which opens with a traditional prayer and includes some shots at Ignorant America's perceptions of his muslim beliefs. (\"Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader.\") In an act of aggrandizement he places two roughneck freestyles after his faithbased initiative. On the first he chirps, \"You far from the hood like limousine trunks.\" On the second, over JKwon's \"Hood Hop\", he sums up the writing and recording process in 72 seconds, while also cleaning up some local melodrama. \"Knockin at the Door\" is the sort of fullbodied production Lupe excels with; it allows him to wrap his ChiAlistyle syllable construction around it. In all, Part 1 is chockablock with revelatory verses, but it's also limited by the boundaries mixtapes create. He doesn't always spread his wings.Part II shows a marked improvement in his rubbery flow and storytelling abilities, but is again dragged down by obvious \"Still Tippin\"/\"Dear Summer\"/\"Sittin Sidewayz\" freestyleflips. Part III is kind of a gag, an EPstyle goof wherein Lupe rocks over beats from Gorillaz's Demon Days. It's basically a lark, but amplifies Danger Mouse's sometimes derided stylings into something more fruitful.At nearly twoandahalf hours of music, the Fahrenheit series is a breezy introduction to the Chicago emcee. But with Lupe's debut fulllength, Food and Liquor, due this summer it seems obvious he's holding out on us. Can he write an \"Electric Relaxation\" or a \"Ms. Fat Booty\"? \"Kick, Push\" is a start, but it's still unclear how capable he is of converting good will into good songs. "}
