{"label":" Hip-O Select","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/8909/homepage_large.e6d18f19.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"Various Artists","title":"The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 4: 1964","text":"  On April 4, 1964, the Beatles occupied the top five spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and the first two spots on the U.S. album chart. They also had nine other records in the Hot 100. Today, chart dominance like that is incomprehensible, but the British Invasion's shock troops were truly unstoppable that year. The Beatles had a huge assist from American rock'n'roll and r&b, of course, and it couldn't have escaped the notice of Berry Gordy that three songs in their early repertoire \"Please Mr. Postman\", \"You('ve) Really Got a Hold on Me\", and \"Money\" had originally been manufactured in his hit factory. In a great bit of circularity, one of the obscurities extricated from the Hitsville USA, vaults for the fourth volume of HipO Select's incomparable Complete Motown Singles series is \"Give Me a Kiss\" by the Hornets. It is, perhaps, the worst ripoff of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" ever conceived, with lyrics like \"Let's make the scene for Listerine/ Come on, give me a (sound of band members making kissy noises),\" and an arrangement that lifts George Harrison's guitar part verbatim albeit with considerably less technical facility. The odds that the Beatles ever heard this monstrosity are not good (almost nobody heard it, period), but it's emblematic of the way Gordy ran Motown and its sister labels in the early years. By 1964, Motown was a genuine force, releasing consistently excellent music and nibbling at the charts with a constant stream of singles, but Gordy was still not immune to a trend, and \"Give Me a Kiss\" feels like a throwback to his attempts to jump the twist bandwagon in 1961. He needn't have worried. Motown's own sound hit the top spot four times in 1964, and Gordy's years of patient faith in the Supremes finally paid off when \"Where Did Our Love Go\", \"Baby Love\", and \"Come See About Me\" became the first of five consecutive No. 1 hits for both the group and the Holland/Dozier/Holland production team. Mary Wells added a charttopper in \"My Guy\" and the Temptations' \"My Girl\", released that December, at last sent them to the top in early 1965. You know these songs you can still hear all of them on the radio today but they're just the icing on this set's sixlayer cake. The 163 A and Bsides released on Motown, Tamla, V.I.P., Gordy, Soul, and Melody take seven full hours to listen to, but it's easily the most solid set yet in the series, and there are only about a dozen songs with which the famed Quality Control department dropped the ball.  Part of the reason for this consistency is that Gordy finally begun to abandon all the sidelines that were clogging the Hitsville works. The countryfocused Melody subsidiary was the only imprint still working outside the core Motown sound on a regular basis by this point, and I'm still knocked out by the quality of some of the label's sides. Bruce Channel's \"That's What's Happenin'\" successfully merges the Snake Pit groove with rockabilly for a perfect piece of country pop, and it's the kind of invaluable track that only a compilation like this would have resurrected. Also included is the amazing debut of Gordy's new Soul label, Shorty Long's \"Devil With a Blue Dress\", which Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels made massive two years later.  While the Supremes were busy taking up residence in the Top 10, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were being eclipsed. As one of the label's first hitmakers, Reeves understandably came to feel somewhat slighted by all the attention Diana Ross & Co. received from Gordy. The Vandellas didn't have a bad year they hit No. 2 with \"Dancing in the Street\" but it's a bit of a mystery why a song like \"Live Wire\" failed to even creep into the Top 40.  Motown's other big names all check in with outstanding efforts. The Temptations made their first Top 10 showing in January with \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\", and of course there's \"My Girl\", but \"I'll Be in Trouble\" and its Bside \"The Girl's Alright With Me\" are nearly as good. The Four Tops, who had been denied a showcase in their first year at the label, hit right out of the gate with \"Baby I Need Your Loving\", and the Miracles proved everreliable. Stevie Wonder dropped the \"Little\" from the front of his stage name and made major strides as a singer on songs like \"Happy Street\". Marvin Gaye curiously followed up the smash \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\" with a disc that paired a version of \"This Is the Life\" with his admirably refined but still strangely chosen take on \"My Way\". Still, you can't argue with \"How Sweet It Is\" or \"You're a Wonderful One\".  Gaye was also entering a period in which he'd manage a duet with just about every prominent female singer on the Motown roster. He and Mary Wells teamed up for \"Once Upon a Time\" b/w \"What's the Matter With You Baby\", both exquisite pieces of laidback soul. This pair is followed on disc two by Eddie Holland's \"Just Ain't Enough Love\", yet another amazing side from a guy who never got the recognition he deserved as a solo artist. Still, his writing and production work with his brother Brian and Lamont Dozier was a defining element of Motown's 19641967 golden age, and almost everything they touch here turns to gold.  One of the joys of this series has been hearing the oddities next to the hits and lost classics, and the final disc on the set serves up a huge one in the form of Ray Oddis's \"Randy, the Newspaper Boy\" b/w \"Happy Ghoul Tide\". As if the Christmastime songpoem on the Aside wasn't weird enough Oddis sounds like the narrator from an old educational film strip the Bside features him talking with an awful Transylvanian accent to a sped up recording of himself. This holiday season fatherson vampire chat gets even weirder when the father closes the lid to the son's coffin, and the son's voice suddenly has echo on it, as though he's been placed in a cavernous room.  Flirtations with novelty and dance crazes (in this case, the jerk) are at a minimum on this set, though, sidelined in favor of a collection of r&b and soul songs most labels would have been happy to churn out in five years, much less one. 1964 began on a somber note for Berry Gordy in the wake of Kennedy's assassination he had been a huge admirer of the President but by year's end, Motown had just as much unstoppable momentum as those moptopped blokes from overseas. The last single on the set is the Velvelettes' \"He Was Really Sayin' Something\" not a hit, but nonetheless an amazing song with an amazing sound, brimming with all the creative energy that made 1964 Motown's first truly great year.
