{"label":" Cooperative","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/18365/homepage_large.73f9f006.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Katherine St. Asaph","artist":"Martha Wainwright","title":"Come Home to Mama","text":" There's a moment midway through \"Proserpina\", the centerpiece of Martha Wainwright's third studio album, Come Home to Mama, where a choir takes up the refrain: \"Proserpina, Proserpina, go home to your mother, go home to Hera,\" and then Wainwright looses a wail and the song becomes devastating. \"Proserpina\" is the last song Wainwright's mother Kate McGarrigle wrote before dying of cancer, and it was first heard a performance at the Royal Albert Hall by McGarrigle in December of 2009, just weeks before her death. For a show all parties involved knew was final, it's jarring how composed McGarrigle sounds, relishing every detail of wicked underground husbands and faminewracked earth. If there's familial subtext, you'd hardly know it from her delivery. But Wainwright's recording is full of such subtext: the sound is spare and lonely, like she's actually wandering the tundra, and quavery with regret. When she cries out, it's as if there aren't words to express her grief. It's an old technique, but Wainwright's earned the right to claim it. It's inevitable that Come Home to Mama dwells on loss, considering how central family ties are to Wainwright's music. The album's full of imagined talks from mother to child or vice versa. There's the rambling meditation \"All Your Clothes\", where Wainwright wanders from topic to topic in verses of disconnected thoughts (\"The baby's doing fine, my marriage is failing, but I keep trying all the time\"), like she's pretending she's talking to someone other than ghostly backup vocals. She pretends she hears a response, too, on \"Proserpina\" and hushed album closer \"Everything Wrong\", which adds her own child to the conversation. \"I don't want you to feel alone, but you probably will when you are older,\" she says, amid a speech that's half encouragement and half defeated confession. It's hard to tell exactly who's the addressee: her son, or herself. Loneliness aside, Come Home to Mama is not a somber affair. Credit's partly due to new producer Yuka Honda from Cibo Matto, who freshens up the sound considerably. Still, this is a Martha Wainwright album, so a few listeners will expect the saucy songwriter behind titles like \"Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole\", \"I Know You're Married, But I've Got Feelings, Too\", and \"Bleeding All Over You\". They'll be satisfied early on here, whether from Wainwright following \"the sevenyear itch\" on track one with its choicest rhyme or beginning the next song, \"Can You Believe It\", with the wry \"I really like the makeup sex, it's the only kind I ever get.\" It's an obvious attentiongrabber but only the first of an onslaught of selfdeprecating lines, crammed almost backtoback. These would come off cheaply prurient without Wainwright's matteroffact delivery; she performs the song like a comedy routine that works because the speaker thinks she's just spilling facts, sly or wideeyed or earnest or anything but a joke on herself. But none of Wainwright's songs would quite work without her delivery. For all the attention that's been given over the years to her flailing turns of phrasing and melisma, she's at her most powerful when she's restrained. There's nothing remotely \"histrionic\" about closer \"Everything Wrong\", and it's deliberate: The song's all about stuffing down the angst that's pervaded the album. By the final line, Wainwright is barely audible above the mix, speaking like a confidence: \"I have been really, really sad except for having you with your dad.\" As an expression of motherhood whose, it barely matters it's hard to imagine anything better.
