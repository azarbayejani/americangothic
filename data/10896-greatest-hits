{"label":" Columbia","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/13254/homepage_large.70e57c38.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Nas","title":"Greatest Hits","text":" Odds are, if you have any interest in Nas, you've already heard some wisecrack about Illmatic rendering a greatest hits collection redundant. That's bullshit; as one of the alltime great albums in rap history, failing to top it isn't so much a letdown as an inevitability, and from 1996 on, Nas' conflicts with commercialism, identity, and realness have provided more compelling moments on wax than the unendingsophomoreslump theory would have you believe. A 59minute, 14track collection like the new Greatest Hits doesn't even begin to cover it all.Still, the market gets what the market wants, so here's your gratuitous contractfulfillment bestof, hampered by label rights, an absence of deep cuts, and the obligatory previously unreleased stuff. Given the fact that anyone with a computer and a reasonably complete Nas discography can make their own personal Greatest Hits throw on five tracks from supergroup the Firm if you want, go nuts the thing that defines Nas' bestof isn't that nearly all of the tracks on it are just about bulletproof, but that the stuff that's missing is important if not flatout crucial to defining Nas as an MC.First, there's no \"Halftime\". His 1992 debut single proved he could carry his own track as well as he could carry his guest verses (speaking of which, a great homemade version of Nas' Greatest Hits might kick off with Main Source's \"Live at the Barbeque\"). The track also cemented his viciously intelligent, humorlaced style, and features one of Large Professor's greatest beats. Second, the problem with picking tracks from an album like Illmatic is that you'd have to stop somewhere, but while its four tracks represented here \"It Ain't Hard to Tell\", \"Life's a Bitch\", \"N.Y. State of Mind\", and \"One Love\" are classic enough that they'd be difficult to substitute anything else for, leaving out \"The World Is Yours\" is just about unforgivable; it is Nas' greatest hit. (Here's a reminder why: \"I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi 'til I'm charged/ Then writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin/ To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement/ Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with.\")\"Hate Me Now\" is the only track included here that was recorded between 1996 and 2001. Even if that period isn't his richest creative stretch it's weird to have it so underrepresented (at least throw in \"Nas Is Like\" or something). And, thanks to label and rights issues, nothing from last year's Hip Hop Is Dead shows up here, even though Columbia jointly financed and promoted it with Def Jam.Then there's the material that defined a huge step in Nas' career in the 2000s namely the JayZ beef. \"Ether\" is one of those rare 21st century tracks that's become an integral part of rap language, with its title becoming a lowercase way of saying you've completely devastated your opponent in battle. Put that in a threesong succession with God's Son cut \"Last Real Nigga Alive\" as the elaboration/defense and \"Black Republicans\" as the reconciliation, and you've got one of the decade's biggest hiphop stories represented in microcosm, maybe, but at least it'd be acknowledged, even if it risked reopening some old wounds.So what's the motive to buy this? The new track, \"Surviving the Times\", is a perfectly fine howIgothere reminiscence that details everything from his apprenticeship under Eric B. & Rakim to MC Serch getting him his first deal with Columbia (\"Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter/ Rebel of hiphop coming through a white rapper\"); it's also a penny short of a buck on iTunes. The other newish cut, the Rush Hour 3 soundtrack fodder/Ceelo showcase \"Less Than an Hour\", sounds like a Gnarls Barkley outtake with Nas on the other side of the \"ft.\"Greatest Hits is still a decent appraisal of Nas' artistic shifts and the risks he's taken in the last decade, with a second half that's as compelling as it is stylistically restless the moneystacks bombast and unhinged fury of \"Hate Me Now\" into the introspective slowburn intensity of \"One Mic\"; the hardcore shotbusting swagger of \"Made You Look\" into the classicist teachtheseeds Afrocentrism of \"I Can\". And going strictly by how good every song on this collection is and nothing else, yeah, it's technically an excellent record. But look at the cover, open the case, take out the CD, leaf through the booklet: You don't see Nas' entire face anywhere in the art for Greatest Hits. You see his eyes filtered through a repeated transcription of \"If I Ruled the World\"'s third verse on the cover, glancing over a skullprint bandana in the tray, peering wearily through his fingers in a photo recycled from the sleeve to the \"Life's a Bitch\" single but you never get a complete portrait. Now turn the case over and check the tracklist... "}
