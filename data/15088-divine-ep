{"label":" Interscope / N.E.E.T.","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16183/homepage_large.b8a242c5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brandon Soderberg","artist":"Blaqstarr","title":"Divine EP","text":" In the video for \"Shake It to the Ground\", from 2007's Supastarr EP, DJ Blaqstarr hides in the corners of the frame, dreadlocked and blunted, wearing a Marvel Zombies Captain America tshirt. He sleepily looks on as teenage rapper Rye Rye runs circles around his cluttered, manic beat. On the cover of Divine EP, nearly four years later, the Baltimore club producer is front and center, shirtless and mohawked, almost cherubiclooking. Probably still blunted. And he has removed \"DJ\" from his name, signaling the shift from gamechanging maker of club music to experimental bedroom producer. For Bmore club obsessives, Blaqstarr's move away from rapidfire dance music is a bit like OutKast's André 3000 starting to sing: a master abandoning his field of expertise for some brassy musical indulgence. Even Blaqstarr's 2006 regional hit \"Ryda Girl\" is stripped of its frenetic dance elements here (and retitled \"Rider Girl\"). Anybody familiar with the original can't help but view Divine EP's softer version as a bit of a buzzkill. But for the many, many more who never heard \"Ryda Girl\", and never heard of Blaqstarr at all, the stumbling interplay of dancing synths, plucked bass, and Blaq's naïve croon are enough to make it transcendent. For most, it doesn't need those trademark Bmore club claps. The Divine EP isn't a complete sea change anyway. The last productions we heard from DJ Blaqstarr in his former style arrived all the way back in 2009 (Rye Rye's \"Bang\" and the single \"Get Off\", produced by Diplo) and his shambling slow jams for M.I.A (Kala's \"The Turn\" or \"XXXO\" and \"It Iz What It Iz\" off /\\/\\/\\Y/\\) are hardly floorfilling stuff. The differences between DJ Blaqstarr, producer of \"Tote It\", a whirl of vocals and a spare gunshot percussion, and the Blaqstarr of \"Divine\", a similar though markedly quieter mess of explosive dance elements and stoned studio meandering, are more a matter of degree. The pastiche qualities of Baltimore club remain, only now Blaqstarr's focus is stacking styles rather than organically fusing them together. \"All the World\", a formless intro track, jerks alive with a burst of dancepunk style drumming; \"Oh My Darlin'\" is an oblique stripper ballad with radio R&B drums. Incessant, eventually hypnotic piano makes \"Turning Out\" a miniepic about lost love (maybe for a girl, maybe for club music). \"Wonder Woman\" sticks spare bluesy guitar on top of a lowinthemix flurry of drums and \"what?!\" shouts. In other words, it's a genuine Baltimore club track. That hint of raucous dance music is a cruel tease to longtime fans of the club music visionary and a tacit acknowledgment by Blaqstarr himself that producing nextlevel chaos is just one of the many things that interests him these days. Now, you've got to listen closely. Divine EP won't grab you by the throat. It runs on its own pothead logic and takes a little while to sink in. These songs become much more interesting during their 10th listen, and though that's taxing, especially coming from a producer whose reputation previously hinged on explosive dance tracks, it doesn't make Divine EP's ghettotechtinged, meditative R&B any less remarkable.
