That's three syllables, tralala, unless it's tralala. But either way there's actually seven, four girls acclaimed for their bangs plus three guys semiacclaimed for banging on instruments. They do this to form notes, which can be used for chords. Tralala rely on just a few, sometimes three! But those must be enough because tiny sinusinfected lunchrecess vox fill out the rest, courtesy mostly of the four with bangs. No, not Bangs: Meltzer. Of course three of these guy/girls already maybe know that, having employment experience with the same Greenwich Village record store that birthed Animal Collective. Tralala's kingdom is far simpler: Ramonesy NYC fuzz and girlgroup social agony stuck in bubblegum pop. Hello Raveonettes, right? But that's another story for a different subway stop. Tralala are recently corrupted naifs wandering heartsick through a shadowy cinematic Gotham. Except a song like \"The Girls Say\" is pretty seriously solid, puton or no. It stands out through sheer force of \"ba ba baba ba daaa da\" and yes subtleties like a nervous (please god not pregnant) pause between \"de\" and \"flate\" at the end of a line. Our narrator loves a certain boy because he's beautiful or is he beautiful because other girls say she should love him? \"I trust my friends, but I can't trust myself,\" she laments, and any critic of the human primate's pack instinct knows that's not a problem of youth alone. For all the handclaps and harmonies, Tralala are at least as notthatinnocent as Skye Sweetnam, with or without her collagen hookup. Toorote opener \"All Fired Up\" sure sounds like it's about sex. Same with rootsier closer \"Like This\": \"Feels so good, oh baby/ Let's do it again\". Shocking, I know. \"No/Yeah\" even conjures up carnival cruises with \"Lust for Life\" drums and more girlish lust. Sample lyric: \"Am I just some kid to you?\" Bland mimickry also weakens \"Everybody's Doin' Fine\", which reminds us that Judy was a punk before she was a dick slap. All of which brings us back to Number One, bummer your girlfriend says that's gross. "}
