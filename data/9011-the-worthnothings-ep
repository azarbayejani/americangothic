{"label":" Stones Throw","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/8859/homepage_large.5ffa271a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Will Dukes","artist":"Georgia Anne Muldrow","title":"The Worthnothings EP","text":"  Emerging from the same Los Angeles scene that spawned such nextlevel soulsters as SARA Creative Partners and J*Davey, 22yearold Georgia Anne Muldrow was born into a family of creative musicians: Her mother was a singer for the Pharaoh Sanders Ensemble, and her father was a pioneer of \"that crazy guitar thing\" heard on jazzman Eddie Harris' \"I Need Money\". On The Worthnothings, her debut EP, Georgia Anne Muldrow sets out to solidify her musical stock, displaying her formidable voice over the course of seven tracks, all of which she wrote and produced. On the delightful \"Larva\", one of the record's highlights, Muldrow shows her insightful side atop a toasty, kicksnare combo, singing, \"Oh, joy life, won't you learn me/ Destroy what is left of me.\" The song, whose caterpillar allusions speak to spiritual growth, prominently features her jazzinflected vocals, which, over the track's neoclassical thump, sound divine. There's also no shortage of introspection on the minimalist \"Demise\", which finds the budding chanteuse \"trying to maintain\" in a world full of pressures and overdue rents. Though songs like \"Lo Mein\" and \"Nothingness\" flaunt a sunnier, less conflicted feel, much of the disc is bogged down by thankless selfanalysis. \"Cool World\", an exotic, drumheavy affair, is undermined by Muldrow's musings (on how her courage betrays her), which, by then, begin to grate, like your friend who only calls you when she feels like complaining. The EP's relative brevity only underscores this problem.  Thankfully, Muldrow's gorgeous voice is charming enough to compensate for such shortcomings. And when suited with her more melodic productions, it assumes a sort of lilting grace on par with that of songstress Jill Scott's. Though not without its missteps, The Worthnothings is a quite capable debut from a multitalented singersongwriter who should only improve over time. Mr. and Mrs. Muldrow should be proud.  "}
