When Farina is at his best he can paint an evocative picture with a minimum of strokes, either a few pointed lyrical abstractions or a handful of strums and plucks. Unfortunately, he's often erred on the side of excess, going overboard with his guitar heroics or wordplay and turning seemingly pleasant or interesting tunes into loveless labors. This familiar turn occurs much too often on Glorytellers' intermittently enjoyable fulllength debut.The story goes that Farina wrote most of the album's songs on a beatup flamenco guitar while ensconced in a secluded cabin in the mountains of northern Italy. It might seem like a setup that's too good to be true, but Glorytellers shines brightest when it comes closest to realizing that idyllic scene. \"Trovato Suono\" (Italian for \"Found Sound\") does this the best of all the album's tracks. It combines flamenco strumming and brushed drums with unobtrusive pluggedin flourishes, and Farina, in his indomitable affectfree voice, gracefully offers some phrases to abet the whimsical worries (\"Head feels like a satellite/ Dark side of the earth tonight\") at the root of his lyric. The tracks that lean on evocative images of nature also tap into this earthy simplicity, whether they be the slightly overwrought similes of \"Exclusive Hurricanes\" (\"You are like the tree/ That spreads out all its seed\") or the decidedly wintery backdrop behind album closer \"Perennials\". The unfussy arrangements that accompany these tracks help enhance that charm.\"Tears Of...\" seems to be a similar slice of breezy prettiness, with its gentle arpeggios and lazy gallop, but semitopical lines like \"infidels stare at you longest straight in the eye\" and \"tell the 30oddmillion what their tears are made of\" belie the track's relaxed demeanor and reveal the song to be an effective, if diffuse, polemic. Other attempts to speak hardhitting poetic truths, however, aren't nearly as successful. The fractured family portrait sketched out in \"Camouflage\" comes off as overwritten and overly emotive, and is also weighed down with intrusive spasms of electric guitar noodling.A few tracks specifically \"Quarantine\" and \"Anonymous\" are so overloaded with words that Farina ends up cramming too much into too small a space, an arrangement that's unflattering to both the tales he's trying to tell and the voice giving them life. The tunes behind these words don't help matters the music in \"Quarantine\" is as harried and frantic as the lyric it's chasing, and the jazzguitar licks that show up on \"Anonymous\" are anything but hot. The one place this approach comes closest to succeeding is in \"Awake at the Wheel\", where the nonstop rush of words and images are used in the service of a bandtour story that's seemingly about running across the stillfresh site of a roadside murder. Unfortunately, the abstraction of the actual events occurring in the song doesn't mesh with the specificity of the mentioned details, and the meandering shamble of a tune underneath it all clashes with the material. One or two missteps like this, where reach exceeds grasp and passion overwhelms prudence, are understandable if not commendable. The problem with Glorytellers is that the modest moments where song and story work together and coexist peacefully are in short supply. "}
