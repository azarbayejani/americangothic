Their name translates to \"Y2K bug\" or \"year 2000 problem,\" and they've been around for 10 years, making albums, zines, live CDRs and handmade clothes. Still, they haven't released an album stateside. Neji/Tori, two of their earlier EPs bundled together, at least postpones that release gap in their discography. But their biggest problem is that on record you can't get the contrast between their physical size and the size of their music. It's that contrast that struck visiting U.S. musicians like Prefuse 73, who called them both \"tiny\" and \"diminuative\" in a Dazed & Confused interview. \"The drummer was as big as my hand,\" he said, before waxing romantic on their technical prowess. That contrast between size and sound is probably startling, but size doesn't matter much overseas. They may be dainty when compared to their U.S. counterparts, but their proper context is within Japan's lush experimental scene, from Koenjihyakkei to Boredoms and Merzbow, where women can be responsible for the harshest sounds.The two EPs here were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Tori's titles are in Japanese, but Neji's songs are named for their influences. \"Sonic Youth\" is aptly named, as bassist Yuri Zaikawa slows her nimble runs to approximate Kim Gordon's sturdy, deliberate plucks. But many other tracks show clear influences even if they're not named for them. \"Kyaaaaaaa\" partially turns into a rumbling surf tune, and \"Ikkkyokume\" snakes into a chase song for a 1960s spy flick. \"2534\" could have been called \"Lightning Bolt\", as their influence is clearest here (the band is also one of Nisennenmondai's stateside supporters). At just over one minute, it's their shortest song, but the best cuts here are the longer tracks, where the repetitiveness pushes forward and retreats over each iteration.Nisennenmondai's eagerness to depart from tonality and form is inherited as much from the free jazz tradition as from these named influences. Zaikawa and drummer Sayaka Himeno set up pins for guitarist Masako Takada to strike down via her looser, messier playing. Her approach doesn't contribute much to the overall \"small women with big chops\" image of the band she's not as muscular, her parts not as technically impressive but her guitar morphs while the others stay the same. No matter what sits on top, an undulating groove hides beneath noise, thanks to the Zaikawa and Himeno's precise rhythm. They'd be fun to watch, not for their size, but for how quickly and often Himeno's hihat must turn to shards. It almost seems a shame to put much distortion and noise over them, but their cleanest, most repetitive tracks, like \"Kyuukohan\", clearly fall behind the ones that combust. Nisennenmondai are pummeling, but not because they use repetition as a way of imprinting songs to your memory. They're bigger than that. "}
