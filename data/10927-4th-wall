The L.A. sextet's song isn't a cover, nor does it touch the same emotional spheres of James Murphy's original, or the worthy covers from Franz Ferdinand or John Cale. That not West Indian Girl's point, either; their object with 4th & Wall is quite the opposite, actually. Where Murphy et al use those closest to them as springboards for nuanced expressions of longing, regret, and passion, West Indian Girl sticks firmly within the realm of sundrenched escapism and celestial sonics: \"All my friends get high.\"  \"High\" isn't necessarily referring to a feeling created by ingested inebriants, either. No, this \"high\" is of the stripe that movie surfers talk about. West Indian Girl takes literally the \"City of Angels\" moniker of its hometown, and pack 4th & Wall with a glassy, newage haze. Like the New Pornographers if Todd Fancey's gossamer softrock keyboard vibe replaced Carl Newman's driving powerpop, the album's sonic M.O. is spacedout, burbling synthesizers, guitars that ring like digital travel alarm clocks, and tiffany vocals floating above, and looking down upon the sex and danger pocking L.A.'s streets. The street corner that gives the album its name also inspired 4th & Wall's prevailing dialectic: L.A.'s dueling vibes of heavenly cool and urban decay. The band describes its studio thusly: \"An old warehouse surrounded by a humble community of homeless people living in cardboard boxes and tents. They're our captive audience, listening to us every night...we conjure up spirits and manifest visions...of a better place.\" 4th  is shot through with this sort of na√Øve urban transcendence and PSAlevel awareness. The sole lyric of \"Lost Children\", for example \"You're all alone, and you follow me\" suggests equal parts sympathy and distance.  Albumopener \"To Die in L.A.\" chronicles a moment when, within the confines of the city, you realize that \"you don't know how you got there,\" and first single \"Blue Wave\" and roadtrip fable \"Up the Coast\" offer two solutions to the existential quandary: grab your board, or find your keys. Though most of its music is underformed and based on wideeyed wish fulfillment, West Indian Girl hits their mark once, with \"Sophia\". It's their bombastic classicrock moment a waferthin, vaporous \"Layla\", as it were, with the ridiculously overwrought poetry of the verses (\"Love is a symphony and/ She and God are one\") leading to a surging chorus. That's only the beginning, though: during the song's three minute coda, Sophia is guided heavenward by a melismatic, glassshattering soprano, followed a what sounds like a restrained take on Clare Torrey's passionate screaming at the end of Pink Floyd's \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". \"Sophia\" plays like an encapsulation of the 70s' most decadent rock moments heard through a smog of innocent sincerity and Valium, and it's actually pretty great.  As depicted through 4th & Wall's liner note photo montage a series depicting wayward, streetlit youth trying to make an unforgiving urban landscape their own, somehow West Indian Girl's primary strength is its artless, unironic embrace of humanity's capacity to make itself better. The city that inspires them, then, should be the same place they cash the majority of their checks: 4th & Wall might not stand up to scrutiny on its own merit, but there are more than a few teen dramas and automotive admen seeking soundtrack fodder for the 1824 demo. It's a noble endeavor, of course, and a perfect venue for music so charged relentlessly hopeful, allinclusive sentiment. "}
