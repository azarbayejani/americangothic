{"label":" Fourthcity","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/15931/homepage_large.bc10972c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Truckasauras","title":"Quarters","text":" Even if you had no clue what terms like \"chiptunes\" or \"circuit bending\" meant back in 2008, the packaging of Truckasauras' Tea Parties, Guns & Valor gave you an accurate picture of their aesthetic: \"The Simpsons\", monster trucks, neon paint, Nintendo, the WWF. So what's with the Bleach­like cover of Quarters? Is the Seattle quartet trying to cement its place in the city's musical legacy, or, gasp! trying to present themselves as \"serious artists?\" Of course, a closer look at the grayscale image shows the group amidst a gang of empty liquor bottles, skateboards, and assorted video game equipment.In fact, Quarters might be even more of a straightup party record than its predecessor, a welcome relief that Truckasauras aren't trying to overcompensate for working within a niche that's almost entirely defined by its novelty. While \"instrumental hiphop\" often brings to mind Dilla heads or the buggedout experimentalism of the Brainfeeder scene, Truckasauras have always put themselves forth unironically as \"crunk.\" It's not the most accurate description, but they do share a sort of kinship with more slithery but no less hedonistic Atlanta sounds, as tracks like \"Dom P on Your Backneck\" and \"Show These People Who's Springstein (Yes We Can)\" boast enough 808 and BASS bass to soundtrack a night cruise to Magic City.Tea Parties turned out to be enduring even after you got past the Contra and Ultimate Warrior jokes, in large part because its sonics explored a fragile, lowgrade beauty. That aspect is still on Quarters, though they arrive at it differently, locating more placid drones while maintaining a rhythmic force. If the prickly, pinwheeling beeps at the outset of \"No More Nerds, Comanche Brancho\" were to simply repeat throughout, it would likely drive you batshit, but it becomes something more like a percussive effect under the quacking bass it's not far off from Discovery's side B or even DâmFunk for its honest appropriation of roller rink chintz.While Quarters is ultimately a refinement of Truckasauras' sound, it's possible that some might be mildly let down as they focus more on craftsmanship than showmanship once again, the overall packaging of this stuff is important, and the inherent humor sometimes only manifests itself in the song titles, instead of in the wow factor of recognizing a sample from Operation Wolf. But if the primary battle that Truckasauras face is avoiding redundancy while still being a genre of one, credit them for having the upper hand on Quarters. "}
