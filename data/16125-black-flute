The Brooklyn band can be pretty hard to peg, but they maintain a very entertaining Twitter feed, make hiphop beats on the side, and their debut, Black Flute, is being released on Das Racist's Greedhead label. So, having our full attention and the weight of expectations, how do Keepaway choose to reintroduce themselves? Here's the first line on \"Cake\": \"Everything/ Waohohohoh/ Tastes like lemons.\" Okay, so it's no surprise that these guys skew a little hackysack, but it's not so much what Nick Nauman says right there, but how it sticks out so blatantly. Black Flute executes a frankly baffling gameplan that forefronts Nauman's newly grating vocals, the timbre and content of which serve as the anchors in Black Flute's thudding disappointment. They've done away with the wavy, reverbsoaked production that typified \"Yellow Wings\" and \"5 Rings\", which at least superficially feels like a wise decision: After all, who hasn't tired of that kind of thing over the past couple of years? Of course, that mindset overlooks the possibility that some acts are just better off with some sort of sonic obfuscation, and Black Flute wholly hitches itself to grouphug harmonies and lyrics that are intelligible but inscrutable conflations of philosophy, sex, and religion. It's occasionally welcoming, but mostly confusing in a manner akin to walking in on the culmination of a dormroom bull session. Credit to Keepaway for being a band that seems to have an investment in what they actually say, even if they do traffic in awkward carnality (so says \"Vital\": \"Every cat's gotta scratch, gotta run/ Can I make you find the milk on the tip of my tongue\") and vaguely stoned revelations as impenetrable as adobe slabs. \"Hologram\" tries to coalesce Garden of Eden imagery with scifi futurism, but mostly sounds like a Yeasayer demo, and even without the trippy studio effects, tracks like \"Royal Jelly\" tend to drift thanks to runon fantasias like \"16 royal elephants/ I'm hardly running/ But I'm moving twice as fast as them/ Each one has a rider/ Dressed in royal armor.\" I mean, make fun of Rusted Root all you want, but at least they yodeled what they meant. There's a certain logic to it all, and some of Black Flute manages to lodge itself into your brain on sheer repetition, even if it doesn't always feel particularly welcome. There are hooks situated within this fruitopia of lightstepping reggae (\"Cake\", \"Bomb Track\"), Casio synthpop (\"Hologram\"), and unmoored R&B balladry (the closing \"Purple\") that aspire to the sonically dry but lyrically louche configuration of early Prince. But in light of the lush production they contributed to Das Racist (especially \"Amazing\" from Sit Down, Man), you question why they've grown so enamored with all these Tinker Toy drum patterns and a bass that occasionally sounds like it's not even plugged in. And so rather than stressing its lilting harmonies and sopping atmosphere, \"Vital\" doubles down on Nauman's nearfalsetto, which has the shrieking edge of Avey Tare, but none of the catharsis. Considering the promise Keepaway had initially shown, you want to give Black Flute the benefit of the doubt, digging past its surface miscues for deepseated flaws that might not be their own fault is it the culmination of Animal Collective's opening the tent for Phishheads combined with the judgmentaversion fostered by the social networking presence of Brooklyn's increasingly chummy indie scene?  Or is it an LPlength extension of \"Deep Ass Shit (You'll Get It When You're High)\"? Or maybe Black Flute just feels so suited for campus quads because it folds so quickly in the face of pragmatic scrutiny, its dimethin arrangements and cashedbowl musings equal parts selfdenial and selfindulgence.
