{"label":" Sincerely Yours","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/16061/homepage_large.97a5e749.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Bevan","artist":"jj","title":"Kills","text":" In the parade of 2010 holiday releases, jj's was among the most anticipated. In late November, the pop polymaths gave away single \"Let Them\" and promised to leave a free, new mixtape beneath the tree on Christmas Eve. And there it was, glistening on the Sincerely Yours website when the 24th came: A download link, well worth the wait. Kills is a true mixtape in both senses of the word. First, like the American rap tapes they seem to love (they've toyed with a lot of nonmixtape material as well as R&B covers in the past), much of this outing finds Elin Kastlander laying her vaporous vocals over other people's samples. It's all very tongueincheek but at its core, Kills, which features a version of the \"Let Them\" single retitled \"Kill Them\", also plays like the kind of tape one fan/nerd might give as a gift, but with a twist. These are songs and samples and scraps of melody they clearly loved enough to share. jj boast a peerless melodic sensibility, and on this tape they're at once disorienting and exhilarating. You may even LOL every now and then. Because there's a lot of fun to be found in hearing, say, the hydraulicized pluck of Dr. Dre's \"Still D.R.E.\" slice through Kastlander's goofy, weedheavy, Weezysaluting whispers on opener \"Still\". Or in \"Die Tonight\", a Frankenstein of a track that opens with Kastlander lifting lines from Robyn's \"Hang With Me\" before vaulting into a dancepop floor banger sewn together with a sample from Taio Cruz's \"Dynamite\". Though underrated, stretches of n° 3 did sound as though they had been left incomplete or drained of all the color that made its predecessor so vibrant. Even when smoked out or slowed down, Kills still teems with energy and both Kastlander and Joakim Benon, chameleons that they are, blend into snippets of song just as well as they shift gears between genres. A lot of that is due to how well they can identify the potential for a new song in someone else's. \"Kill  You\" for example, takes M.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\" and transforms it into a torchwielding breakup hymn. Kastlander riffs on the chorus, Benon adds a cushion of synths that sound like they could part clouds, and wham, you hear a new interpretation of a song (and its raised gun sample) that could go over fine in the quiet of a church. On \"New Work\", the duo takes the piano melody from JayZ's \"Empire State of Mind\" and makes it the chassis for a song about being young and starryeyed elsewhere. And then there's \"Angels\", which clips a Biggie Smalls vocal from a DiddyDirty Money track and bookends it with 2Pac's \"Changes\". Thankfully, this sort of conceptual relief saves the whole affair from being a slew of stonerizations and AutoTuned fauxswagger, which, by the way, still somehow ends up wreaking of swagger. But in the end, as energizing as it tends to be, Kills feels more like a oneoff stopgap between original jj fulllengths, an illuminating detour for creativity's sake. The album's climax, \"Boom\", stitches together three distinct pieces of Kanye's latest opus and then boldly tacks on blasts from Hans Zimmer's Inception score for even more gusto. When that \"can we get much higher?\" sampling from \"Dark Fantasy\", drifts in, it's not clear whether jj are referencing weed again or simply commenting on some music they love. But when Kastlander hums over the last few bars of \"Runaway\", the two seem one in the same. This is how they sing along. "}
