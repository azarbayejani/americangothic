Though it's not as if the Besnard Lakes were unfairly denied their due, having released a gauzy 2003 debut that was heavy on languorous shoegazer jangle/drone, but low on personality and vigor.The Dark Horse shares that album's deliberate sense of pacing, precious attention to detail and hermetic soundworld atmosphere; the difference here is that almost every song builds to a crucial moment where the Besnards bravely step out of the shadows, and in the process, transform from being a merely good band to a great one. And just as the individual tracks ascend to their own internal peaks, so too does the eightsong sequence as a whole, which means patience is certainly a virtue here: Opener \"Disaster\" begins as a swell of forlorn falsettos and weepy strings (courtesy of inhouse arranger Nicole Lizee and moonlighting Godspeed violinist Sophie Trudeau) that yields to a slumberous chorus of Brian Wilson harmonies; \"For Agent 13\" is all slowdissolving, ladiesandgentlemanwearefloatinginSpiritualized tremolos and mournful coos that sound like they're coming from a castrated Sigur RÃ³s. It's not until the third track, \"And You Lied to Me\", that The Dark Horse really achieves liftoff, and not without some great effort: the song seems to be deliberately working against its itself with its Floydian glide, oddly timed drum rolls at the chorus and frequent pauses filled in with strange, indecipherable murmurs. But finally, at the 4:56, we hit pay dirt: after a brief stop, the drums kick in and guitarist Steve Raegele and guest Jonathan Cummins (ex of the Doughboys, currently of Bionic) blast into a glorious twoway duel worthy of its own planetarium laser show. And then instead of coming down, the Besnards turn it up another notch thanks to bassist/Lacek's belle Olga Goreas' star turn on \"Devastations\", a hellacious, fucktheman screen delivered in 70ssmooth girly harmonies that provide an uncanny contrast to song's monstrous psychmetal groove and oh yes climactic threeway drum solo.  Together, these two songs form the front half of The Dark Horse's awesome middle stretch, but their playful bombast is effectively counterbalanced by the two songs that follow: \"Because Tonight\" is the album's most moving performance, a swaying spacerock ballad that intensifies into a beautifully bawling chorus; \"Ride the Rails\" is its most foreboding, with a circular bass riff and ominous violin inflections that lend it an ominous allure. It's also the song that best exemplifies Lacek's recurring lyrical strategy of trading off between World War IIera imagery and the present tense, with verses told through the eyes of a desperate drifter (\"Gotta find a better to go on\") and a chorus (\"my father rides the rails\") that shifts the perspective to a contemporary thirdperson telling. So it figures that the one song with an identifiably modern setting Brooklyn set piece \"On Bedford and Grand\" is the one that ultimately breaks The Dark Horse's dreamlike spell, an amiable but uneventful fuzzpop exercise on which the Besnards come off as just another band of shoegaze revivalists.  But as sprightly Beach Boys pastiche \"Cedric's War\" gallops triumphantly to the finish line, you realize what's really remarkable about The Dark Horse: that for all its epic intimations and interstellar overdriving, the album still clocks in at a lean 45 minutes. Clearly, the Besnard Lakes are the product of a generation that remembers when their favorite albums used to fit perfectly on one side of a C90. But they've retrofitted classicrock grandeur to indierock dimensions and forged their own special niche spacerock that's down to Earth.  "}
