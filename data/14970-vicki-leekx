As a selfconsciously confrontational experiment in allout agitprop and industrial sonic overload, that record had snarl and ambition but little of the sassy snap and sidelong force of her first two classics, Arular and Kala. For all her bombsexploding imagery and globalwarchild empathy, M.I.A. always came off like a smart, arty, roundtheway girl who, it happened, had seen some shit; she was concerned about the fate of her homeland and about the text messages on her man's phone, and those concerns coexisted in nervous harmony. /\\/\\/\\Y/\\ replaced that persona with a nearhumorless conspiracy theorist who really seemed to think the government controlled Facebook. But with her new Vicki Leekx mixtape, M.I.A. buries her 2010 with a single, chaotic, 36minute track. Released to the Internet on New Year's Eve, Vicki Leekx madly crams around 20 tracks into its runtime and channels /\\/\\/\\Y/\\'s furious tumult into something that sometimes slips into sheer dizzy joy. Vicki Leekx is also an experiment in steamrolling sonic overdrive. This is a busy piece of work, with noisy interruptions and song excerpts that end as soon as they begin. But it's delivered with heart and vigor and humor, and it reintroduces an M.I.A. who actually sounds like M.I.A. once again. Vicki Leekx is M.I.A.'s first mixtape since she and thenboyfriend Diplo released Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1 more than six years ago, introducing her to the world in a blur of thencurrent globalpop genrefusion. Piracy Funds Terrorism chased its moment, and M.I.A. existed beautifully alongside Missy Elliott and baile funk and LL Cool J's \"Headsprung\". Without Diplo playing party controller (though he does contribute some production), Vicki Leekx only rarely sounds specific to an instance in time. Musically, it falls right into M.I.A.'s wheelhouse: fast, cheap, and out of control dance music that pulls a ton from Baltimore club and oldschool rave but never settles into anything you could nail down as an actual genre. A couple of /\\/\\/\\Y/\\ tracks show up here in stridently altered form, pushed toward partyanthem status. The tape's itchy beats dissolve into each other with headwhirl speed, and its momentum flags only at the end, when a series of slower tracks force things into the wrong gear. And periodically, a digitized female voice the record's title character floats in to add Internetage sloganeering, like an insurrectionist version of the robotic tour guide from A Tribe Called Quest's Midnight Marauders. But despite its title, Vicki Leekx isn't a blast of political turmoil. Instead, it's M.I.A. tuning back into everyday life and microlevel personal relationships. One song, without any detectable irony, is titled \"Let Me Hump You\", and it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Another, \"Super Tight\", finds M.I.A. using sex as a weapon: \"You better be big boy kryptonite because I got my shit down super tight.\" \"GenNEY\" seems to target old frienemy Diplo. And the harshest blast of bile, \"Marsha/Britney\", is a scathing attack on \"bitches who are fame hoes,\" or, more specifically, a girl who \"wanna be a model for American Apparel\" and \"always claim she's part native Navajo.\" Even in a brilliantly petty snarl like this, though, M.I.A. uses politics just to give her taunts a little extra bite: \"Your shoes could feed a village; you should think about that.\" In its brief onslaught of sneery fun, Vicki Leekx only occasionally reaches the dizzy pop heights of Arular and Kala. But it does give us an M.I.A. who, once again, seems to be having a blast doing what she's doing. And it's great to learn this M.I.A. still exists. I'd sigh with relief if the thing hadn't left me breathless. "}
