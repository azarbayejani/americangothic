A far cry from their recent selfindulgent pouts, 2002's Revolverution and 2005's New Whirl Odor, How You Sell Soul to a Souless People Who Sold Their Soul??? gets at the finicky emotional recipe for P.E.'s success. Instead of pretending to strut and rage Ã  la those aforementioned mid1990s old grey mare trudges, How You Sell Soul (there is no way to cleanly truncate most P.E. titles) revisits instrumental blueprints from Fear of a Black Planet and It Takes a Nation of Millions, enshrined intros \"The brother don't swear he nice/ He KNOWS he nice!\" and plays the selfreferencing cards with aplomb. Because when piss and vinegar is your blood type, there's no such thing as tempering. Old age is just a new window to shoot from. The band combats \"age\" with disclosure: The liner notes sprawl like yearbook memories, thanking old AC/DC records for inspiration alongside Chuck's handholding descriptions of just how and why each song was constructed sample history, just WHY he respects KRS so much and just needed him for \"Sex, Drugs & Violence\". Chuck D even tones down his stillglorious solo megaphone riot and concedes: \"Thank you for letting us be ourselves/ So don't mind me if I repeat myself/ These simple lines be good for your health\" (\"Harder Than You Think\"). Simple chestnuts they are: kids gotta read, governments gotta be questioned, and gangster rap is fine, as long as you know it's rap, not reality.  And the skeletal disclosure works. Aside from a few ungainly, obvious missteps trying to play the Scott Storch melodic game on \"Amerikan Gangster\", wasting the KRS runin on a track that sounds like a D12 refuse pile (\"Sex, Drugs & Violence\") the album is finely sequenced. Newsreelish interludes punctuate the album into thematic thirds (rebirth, bitches!/appraising the day/stumping for the apocalypse). The nakedly obvious structure loosens everyone's valves. Chuck worries about images and phonetics \"watch the masses move as a mass of switches,\" \"Botswana to Watts and Queens.\" The best melodies are given the space (Read: minimal Flav howling, Chuck pays attention to breath control) to breathe see the stubblefunk trash on \"Frankenstar\", the Commodores sample on \"Escapism\", and, the album's best track, Redman's burbling production and winsome guest verse on \"Can You Hear Me Now?\"  When How You Sell Soul rounds the corner into its raging final third, there's a nice little epiphany. With the way we now appreciate and consume music, P.E. may never be able to change America again (they probably have a bigger contemporary fanbase outside this continent), but they still can light up a few souls. No matter their pop \"relevance,\" they refuse to, and refuse to let their listeners, be complacent. Read Orwell, beat Yung Joc with a trashcan, don't watch CNN. Just. Do. Something. When the apocalypse is finally unveiled, don't be the hollow man Jocing your way toward Bethlehem.  "}
