Deusner","artist":"Wreckless Eric & Amy Rigby","title":"Wreckless Eric & Amy Rigby","text":" As a solo artist, Amy Rigby has spent more than a decade singing about complicated relationships veering toward messy breakups. She's described the clueless or cruel men in her life with such humor and heartbreak that her persona as a harried or wronged woman often seems at odds with her headstrong performances and pointed songwriting. Still, it's odd to think of her recording an album with her husband, odder that such an endeavor wouldn't be contentious, and oddest that her romantic and musical partner would be Wreckless Eric, the Stiff Records artist best known for his sweetly oddball hits \"The Whole Wide World\" and \"Take the Cash (K.A.S.H.)\". The couple made the matteroffactly titled Wreckless Eric & Amy Rigby at their home in France, performing, recording, and producing everything themselves. Amy gets more songwriting credits, but the music skews toward Eric's fuzzyedged pop. Taken as a whole, the album sounds surprisingly balanced between the two marital giveandtake manifest in music.It's not lofi (the distortion on \"First Mate Rigby\" comes through clearly), but these songs do sound homemade. That staticriddled spiritedness highlights their individual quirks as well as the easy chemistry between the pair. They trade off vocals and gender roles on \"First Mate Rigby\", chuckle at the vagaries of the music biz on the standout \"Round\", and get bitterly wistful on \"Another DriveIn Saturday\". Opener \"Here Comes My Ship\" sets Eric's warbly vocals against what sounds like a keyboard preset beat, then gradually builds to her spokenword bridge and their casual harmonizing. Eric's simple, curious organ line motors through \"Astrovan\", Amy's surprisingly touching eulogy to a dependable tour van. \"You worked so I could play,\" she sings, before revealing its untimely end: \"They left you across town/ I cried the day you were found.\"At times that homemade quality gives Eric Rigby a tossedoff feel, as if it's only a rough draft for something more complete. The filter on Amy's vocals makes her sound distant on the waitress' lament \"A Taste of the Keys\", which isn't helped by the lengthy weather forecast sample that begins and ends the song. The album lacks the gravity and cohesion of their best solo material, but not necessarily the humor. Rigby's \"Men in Sandals\" wonders how Hank Williams' music would have sounded if he'd worn Birks instead of boots, then counsels, \"You can't kick ass in Tevas.\" Toward the end of the album, \"Please Be Nice to Her\" sounds like a valedictory, a farewell to an old self, and their cover of Johnny Cash's \"I Still Miss Someone\" sounds too harmonious to convey the song's deep, dark yearning. Whether Wreckless Amy represents a oneoff collaboration or the start of an ongoing project for both musicians remains to be seen, but they sound pretty happy together. "}
