{"label":" Jive","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/10346/homepage_large.48c3e34b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tom Breihan","artist":"UGK","title":"Underground Kingz","text":"  Even when they were scrappy newcomers from a town no one in rap cared about, UGK's Bun B and Pimp C sounded like wizened old veterans. Pimp's beats were slow, organic countryfunk instrumentals; they could've passed for Stax backing tracks if they didn't have so much bass. Bun's matteroffact, virtuoso, baritone flow exuded weariness and authority. Fifteen years later, the Texas duo sound like eternal, immovable features on rap's landscape, and their style has hardened into a blueprint; an album like T.I.'s Trap Muzik, say, would've been nearunthinkable without UGK's precedent. But it's been a while since we've heard from UGK. Dirty Money, their last album, came out in 2001. Since that time, Pimp spent four years in prison for violating his probation on an aggravated assault charge. During Pimp's imprisonment, the South became rap's dominant region, and Bun kept the group's name alive by going on an absolute guestappearance tear, popping up on tracks with virtually every major rapper working. Even after Pimp's release, UGK's label pushed back the release of this album for nearly a year. And so now the album's release makes for a weirdly bittersweet moment: Underground Kingz is an equally frustrated and vindicated album. Pimp hasn't forgotten what it was like to rot in a cell while his region exploded, and Bun hasn't forgotten that he had to keep his group above water by himself. Neither has forgotten a decadeandahalf of recordlabel drama and elusive success, and neither seems particularly happy with a rap climate that they helped to shape. On album opener \"Swishas & Dosha\", Pimp sneers at his successors: \"I remember when a rapper was a gogetter/ Now all these rappers is some ho niggas.\" Bun agrees: \"You MySpacing and Facebooking, playing games with them toys/ I'm in the streets where gangstas meet while you online with them boys.\" Throughout Underground Kingz, Pimp and Bun wield their legacy like a club. They repurpose two rap classics, Too Short's \"Life Is...Too Short\" and Scarface's \"The Fix\" on \"Life Is 2009\" and \"Still Ridin Dirty\", songs that feature Too Short and Scarface, respectively. (The latter doesn't rap; he just shows up singing histrionic fakegospel on the hook. It's awesome.) Other rap legends show up as well: Geto Boys bulldog Willie D snaps at regiondismissers on \"Quit Hatin' the South\". Houston depressive ZRo waxes elegiac on \"Trill Niggas Don't Die\". Big Daddy Kane and Kool G Rap, both oldschool New York royalty, spit weathered threats all over Marley Marl's hard, simple track on \"Next Up\", and Pimp and (especially) Bun sound perfectly athome alongside them. Most transcendently, the two trade verses with another legendary Southern duo, Outkast, on the gorgeous single \"Int'l Players Anthem\". Three 6 Mafia's DJ Paul and Juicy J throw enormous drums under a joyous loop of Willie Hutch's classic blaxploitation ballad \"I Choose You\", and Andre 3000's tender, lovestruck verse perfectly offsets Pimp C's megaton sneer. \"Int'l Players Anthem\" finds UGK in an uncharacteristically euphoric mood, and it just might by my favorite song of the year. Most of Underground Kingz, though, is anything but upbeat. It's the first UGK album where Pimp doesn't handle the lion's share of the production, though most of the album's producers make sure to make their tracks fit the slow, woozy aesthetic that the duo established long ago. On \"Cocaine\", the Blackout Movement curl bluesguitar around minimal drumthumps while Pimp moans the title over and over on the chorus and Bun gives a quick lesson in the drug's history: \"It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich/ They even used to put it in CocaCola; ain't that a bitch?\" On \"Two Types of Bitches\", Momo's nasty bluesguitar and blurting organs lazily circle each other while guest Dizzee Rascal turns up to spit some paranoid misogyny. Elsewhere, the duo absorbs the newer trends in Southern rap, showing the kids how to attack them: Lil Jon's jackedup bass on \"Like That\", the Runners' epic synthchurn on \"Take tha Hood Back\".  The album really hits its stride, though, when Pimp takes over the controls and brings back the sad, heavy countryrap that he does better than anyone else. \"The Game Belongs to Me\" is an irrefutable declaration of supremacy, so warm and effortless that Bun and Pimp's voices sound like they're bubbling up from the track. \"How Long Can It Last\" winds seven minutes of emotional selftorture around screaming bluesguitars and gutrumbling bass. Even a song as formulaic as \"Chrome Plated Woman\", which works the ancient carasgirl concept, is executed with masterly panache. The two discs of Underground Kingz run well over two hours, and plenty of fat could easily have been trimmed. Nobody needs another two tinny synthbeats from Jazze Pha, to say nothing of the man's abysmal verse on \"StopNGo\". The warm sentiment of \"Real Women\" is muchappreciated after the bile of \"Two Types of Bitches,\" the litejazz Fender Rhodes less so. As great as \"Int'l Players Anthem\" is, the album would be fine without its two remixes; the ugly screwedandchopped version practically kills the album's momentum right at the end. Still, these aren't complaints; they're quibbles. Underground Kingz is the first UGK album in six years, and it's just an enormous relief to hear that these two can still weave a cohesive longform tapestry of an album better than almost anyone else in rap.
