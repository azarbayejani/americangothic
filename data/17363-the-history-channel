{"label":" self-released","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/18540/homepage_large.745b89a0.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jayson Greene","artist":"E-40 / Too $hort","title":"The History Channel","text":" In rap, growing old is rarely considered an achievement: If rap is a hustle, then you shouldn't hustle past a certain age, and rap overflows with contempt for the tooold hustler. On their double album History, though, West Coast rap legends Too $hort and E40 are not only boasting about their age, they're cramming it down your throat. \"Our shit been poundin' all your life,\" Too $hort sneers on the first song, before asking if you remember sitting in the backseat when your parents played their music. E40 uses the word \"sheezy\" on \"Cali\" before helpfully pointing out, \"I made that word famous.\" Rap isn't a hustle for these guys, it's a life pursuit, and their pride in their combined history, and the ways they've embraced and defied it, is the underlying theme of History. It sounds nothing remotely like a valedictory speech, though. For one, E40 and Too $hort still rap about sex with the hyperactive eagerness of 17year old boys about to have their third sexual encounter: On \"Sheesh\", E40 compares a woman to a \"Game of Thrones\" character with the helpless laughterinducing line \"Her coochie on fire/ She got that dragon crevice.\" On \"Let Me See You Twerk\", he offers a woman his version of a compliment, \"You know how to make a pole disappear.\" Too $hort rhymes \"you just might learn something\" with \"I'm shootin' out sperm, nuttin\" on \"We Are Pioneers\"  a metaphor for spreading wisdom, sure, but the Too $hortest version of that metaphor imaginable. Later on the album, he autographs your girlfriend's sheets using the same method. Nothing keeps you young like a persistent hardon and a filthy sense of humor. Usually when older rappers bring in younger ones for guest verses, it's for a relevance boost, but the young rappers that swing through History Wiz Khalifa on \"Say I\", Tyga on \"Slide Through\" sound like visitors auditioning for $hort and Forty. Wiz in particular gets off a more focused verse than he usually bothers with. Even Bay Area staples like Turf Talk, who has been around for more than 10 years, are young bucks in this room (Turf Talk is, in fact, E40's younger cousin). This is adult swim, time for veterans like Kurupt, Ice Cube, and Battlecat to come out of their corners. It's the presence of peers like this, though, that hammers home just how ageless Forty and $hort sound. Kurupt and Ice Cube sound nothing at all like their younger selves; for better or for worse, you can hear the impact of the years on their voices. Too $hort's voice, by comparison, hasn't altered its tone or grain in decades; It has a nearly Ozzy Osbournelevel resistance to the ages. E40, meanwhile, continues to light up every space he inhabits. On \"I Don't Work For Nobody\", he disses your girl because her \"titties smell like feet\"; on \"Whip Out\", your money is \"so funny it's telling jokes about you like Wanda Sykes.\" His storytelling instinct is still sharp and fresh enough that he can reel off threedimensional character sketches like this one, from \"Singles\": \"After a hard night at work Erica/ Wake up and head out to Bank America/ The tellers wonder what she do and how she got it/ Because she drop off hella ones when she deposit/ Rappers be wantin to fuck, but she don't give it up/ Just because she strip don't mean she a slut/ She got a man at home with a decent JOB/ Work for PG&E, but on the side sell tree.\" To listen to E40 is to meet dozens of these characters.  The production is split down the middle between the flashier, more carefree, hyphyinfluenced production (E40 calls it \"function music\") that has become the speciality of E40's inhouse production stable as usual, his son DroopE contributes the most sonically inventive tracks and heavier, more minimal \"mob music.\" An enormous chunk of California rap history is contained within these two styles, and Too $hort and Forty are their avatars. Listening to them egg each other on over the course of 34 songs is a pleasure, like staying up all night drinking with two disreputable uncles. "}
