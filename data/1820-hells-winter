{"label":" Definitive Jux","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/1804/homepage_large.8bf26682.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tom Breihan","artist":"Cage","title":"Hell's Winter","text":" Cage has the kind of life story most aspiring newschoolers just lie and make up. He was abused by his dishonorablydischarged junky father and his stepfather, kicked out of high school, overmedicated in a mental hospital, became a whiterap wunderkind in the early 90s, almost put out an album on Columbia, kicked around the major label system, got hooked on drugs, had a kid, got dissed on the first Eminem album, and found himself a home in underground rap. It's much more interesting than the stab stab stab, kill kill kill, drugs drugs drugs shit he's been rapping about for years. Hell's Winter, then, is both a revelation and a foreheadslappingly obvious artistic move: The dude finally started drawing on his own experiences.Hell's Winter is a harrowing ride on which Cage describes his childhood in fractured blips of vivid images instead of broad, sweeping statements. On \"Too Heavy for Cherubs\", he matteroffactly, almost gleefully, describes being forced to help his father shoot up: \"Erratic then gone, I went from manic to calm/ Watching the yellow liquid drip back out of his arm.\" On \"Peeranoia\", he recalls his own drug addiction with a boastful, entertained lightness: \"Didn't quit PCP, it quit me/ Reality rolled me up, took two puffs, then clipped me.\" But the album's mission comes into sharpest focus on \"Stripes\", where Cage's anger toward his father comes through without sarcasm or emotional distance. Elsewhere, Cage applies this bleak disgust to subjects outside his past; \"Grand Ol' Party Crash\" has an obnoxiously bananas George W. Bush impression by Jello Biafra, but Cage also describes a soldier dying in the hospital: \"He gets word that his unit didn't make it/ Got a free ticket home, but flatlined before he got to take it.\" Of course, Cage also remains a demonic shockrapper, and that side of him is fully on display here. He still bashes his old label boss, still fantasizes about murderous rampages, and unfortunately still says stuff like, \"There's a thin line between love and a fuck/ And how drunk she gotta be to put it in her butt.\" But part of what makes Hell's Winter work is that Cage still sounds hungry and savage and wildeyed; it wouldn't be anywhere near as charged or scalding if he'd turned into Atmosphere overnight.  Even without the lyrics, Hell's Winter is the fullest realization of the Def Jux aesthetic since Mr. Lif's I Phantom. Much of the production comes from ElP, Central Services, and Blockhead, and all three rub heavy fallingdownstairs drums and glitchworks against gorgeously spacey blankets of synth. DJ Shadow's track for \"Grand Ol' Party Crash\" is an amelodic fuzzedout stomper, while Camu gives the fiery posse cut \"Left It to Us\" a metalfried guitar lope. Best of all, Rjd2's track for \"Shoot Frank\" is a tragically beautiful showstopper: dying house pianos over moaning female vocals and rolling martial drums, with a stunningly sad and resigned hook crooned by (of all people) Glassjaw's Darryl Palumbo. Like the rest of Hell's Winter, it shows what happens when the smartest people in indie rap decide to stop farting around and make something that resonates.  Â   "}
