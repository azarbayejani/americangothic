Defined by former Pitchfork writer Tom Breihan as \"a cheap, hard, frantic, fiercely regional strain of black house music that exists only within Baltimore,\" the style has been cropping up for a few years now on releases by indieoriented artists like Diplo, Spank Rock, and Ghislain Poirier, among others. Albums by hometown Bmore heroes like Rod Lee have been getting reviews from national mags. And then there's HBO's \"The Wire\", which gave local musicians a national TV platform and eventually spawned a fine majorlabel compilation, Beyond Hamsterdam: Baltimore Tracks From The Wire.A Washington, D.C.based DJ/producer with a pronounced Baltimore club influence, Jesse Tittsworth uses the tinny breakbeats and raunchy subject matter of this oncelocal subgenre within a broader dance, pop, and hiphop context. Last year, Tittsworth put out a couple of sampledriven EPs, Afterparty and EZT, both in the Baltimore club style, and he got together with the likeminded DJ Ayres for a Baltimore/Miami loopsandgrooves battle record called T&A Breaks. But Tittsworth also joined the electrohouse hordes churning out \"D.A.N.C.E.\" remixes for Justice. A free Tittsworth DJ mix posted online to promote his first proper album, 12 Steps, jumps from Baltimore's Blaqstarr to Lil Wayne, Kanye West, Daft Punk, Soulja Boy Tell Em, HardFi, and George Michael. Clearly, this could've been Baltimore club's pop moment.Unfortunately, 12 Steps is too little, too late the free mix is worth more of your money. The sort of electrorap synthesis this album achieves has been done before, and better, not just by West, but also by his associates like ATrak, Kid Sister, Flosstradamus, and Cool Kids, or even by Alaskabased Curtis Vodka. Kid Sister, a charismatic young Chicago MC whose \"Pro Nails\" does for manicures what Lil Mama's \"Lip Gloss\" did for L'Oreal, appears on one of 12 Steps' catchiest tracks, \"WTF\". But the \"whassup, whassup\" hook, despite reportedly being sung by postM.I.A. itgirl Santogold, is as dated as the old Budweiser TV campaign; Pase Rock's rhymes about \"So Fresh, So Clean\" and \"Trapped in the Closet\" fall as flat as dayold beer. On blippy first single \"Broke Ass Nigga\", with an orchestral melody similar to the \"place in France\" playground song, Tittsworth skirts the obvious issues inherent in a halfwhite, halfAsian guy throwing around the nword by bringing on guests DJ Assault, Kenny B, Jinxx, and Frankie Baby. The result is mildly funny, particularly the deliciously absurd closing non sequitur: \"Can I hold your fish, man? I need some company.\"But 12 Steps is more interesting when it sounds less East Coast, more European. Tittsworth, whose background is also in hiphop and drum'n'bass, gets the album off to an energetic start on \"Haiku\" by combining those distinctive Baltimore handclaps with robotic filterdisco buzzing and dramatically swooping synths. And on \"4.21\", he turns crackling distortion, hardedged beats, and light, floaty electronics into what could've been one of Simian Mobile Disco's more contemplative tracks. By comparison, predictable fare like the gimmicky \"Bumpin'\", in which a DJ complains about a drunk guy bumping into his turntables, or the raucous Baltimoreclub update \"Drunk as Fuck\", in which a knife sound accompanies rappers the Federation bragging about \"cut[ting] up the pussy like the movie Hostel,\" sounds like (mere) childish imitation.Tittsworth has produced, by and large, an album of potential novelty singles. That's fine you can argue that some of the best records are novelty records but the problem is that most of the tracks on 12 Steps are neither particularly novel nor memorable. The guitarcoated \"Almond Joy\" begs you to wait for it \"play with my heart like a toy,\" and the soppy light R&B of \"Here He Comes\" nicks a melody from Hall and Oates' \"Maneater\", which Timbaland referenced with Nelly Furtado two years ago. As many words as the Clipse have for snow, Baltimore club and its cousin Miami bass have for sex, so letting guest rapper Pitbull settle for such Kindergarten Coplevel laziness here as \"spread legs like a gynecologist\" is an insult. Not to his Miami base, not to Baltimore clubbers, but to pop fans. We're fickle not stupid. "}
