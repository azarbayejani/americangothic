Don't try to look for it, there's no wink here to assure you this classic rock posturing is the least bit tongueincheek. That said, judging this Brooklyn trio's debut by your first visceral impression may be the best way to enjoy them as long as you don't have a weak stomach. Everything about the band is pretty much whatyousee/whatyouget to the extreme: They're called Cheeseburger, they play greasy, sloppy, unapologetically American cock rock that goes well with beer (or a handle of Jack). They write a cryforhelp rocker called \"Tiger\", they make a video for it featuring singer Joe Bradley wearing a tiger suit. They're a rock band, so they craft an album completely obsessed with being in a rock band, sans the calculated commentary of similarly selfaware groups like Art Brut or Brakes. In fact, it's hard to imagine anything is calculated here. These schlubs simply pluck classic rock motifs from their subconscious and get 'em drunk. For example, you could accuse \"Money For the Heart\" of ripping the Who's \"Can't Explain\" riff, but guitarist Christy Karacas butchers it, essentially coopting the guitar hook by mutilation. Bradley is hardly any more coherent, seemingly blacking out as he garbles inebriated battle cries (\"Hey, hey, the gang's all here/ What a bunch of fucking queers!\") and continuously preaching the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. The band has nabbed their fair share of Stooges comparisons, thanks in large part to Bradley's selfdestructive Iggy Pop affectations. However, excepting shorter, unstable numbers like \"Pirate\" or \"Rats\", these songs roar with a rock 'n' roll majesty that's a little too unseemly for garage punk. Sure, it's just vocals, one guitar, and drums, but the backtoback onslaught of \"Easy Street\" and \"Hot Streets\" could rock any arena with its meaty chord progressions and dramatic loudsoft dynamics. By \"Do You Remember?\", the band's punk ethics become irrevocably blurred, but the song's makeshift AOR hooks render the issue a moot point.  As the decadent rock bacchanalia continues, though, the band's intensity falters, leaving you wishing they'd stretch their limits rather than thrashing through the same threechord blitz. \"Cocaine\" feels like an uninspired, obligatory drug anthem, with Bradley notsocleverly feminizing the drug over a lagging guitar riff. Likewise, \"Gang's All Here\" retreads the album's bright spots, reeking of redundancy and diffusing any excitement the song's titular chorus tries to generate. In many ways, Cheeseburger is exactly what critics of innocuous, limpwristed indie rock have been asking for, it's just that the band overcompensated a bit. For every softspoken indie group cooing about trees over keyboards, this debut tries to match it with hamhanded guitar heroics and a couple shouts of \"motherfucker,\" and there's something honorable in their impossible struggle to do so, however garish the result.
