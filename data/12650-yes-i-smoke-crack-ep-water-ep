{"label":" Merok","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/13164/homepage_large.f9369000.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Salem","title":"Water EP","text":" Bass becomes SALEM, a witchy Chicago/Michigan/New York trio consisting of John Holland, Heather Marlatt, and Jack Donoghue. In the wake of last year's resurgence of lofi noise pop, an aesthetic that leaned heavily on treble, their emphasis on the low end distinguishes them from other young bands immersed in 4AD haze. And, as part of SALEM's apocalyptic lofi murkpop aesthetic, it no doubt helped bring them to the attention of Patrik North, previously associated with Montreal label Summer Lovers Unlimited (Crystal Castles, the Tough Alliance, the Teenagers). Last year North cofounded a new label, Ac√©phale, with DJ friend Rory Them Finest, and SALEM's debut, the Yes, I Smoke Crack EP, was their inaugural release. Londonbased Merok (Klaxons, Crystal Castles, the Teenagers getting the picture?) picked up SALEM for a followup, the Water EP. Each limitededition, vinylonly release reveals a group with a distinctive style and a couple of shouldbe indie hits, but not quite the craft or consistency of their finest labelmates just yet.Their best track, \"Redlights\", opens both EPs. Marlatt's ghostly, Cocteau Twinslike vocals ring around scything guitar textures, funereal synths, and a rudimentary, bassheavy electronic beat you might expect from Polow Da Don. It's the kind of disembodied, hardtopindown pleasure that made Burial's Untrue so welcome a couple of years ago, with the indie production values and cigarettesmoking nihilism (Crack? ...Really?) of 1980s goth. As on Burial's \"Archangel\", the hook is just an evocative fragment, in this case about some things that are hard to remember, and some things the ones we haven't done yet that are hard to forget. It's not really so far from M83's electronic shoegaze circa Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. What \"Redlights\" illuminates, the rest of the EPs explores, to mixed effect. Sloweddown spookout muddles \"Water\" and \"Snakes\" hint at, but fail to fully inhabit, the downtuned alien vocal style of the Knife's Silent Shout. One of the quietest tracks, the calypsotinged murderscape \"Deepburn\", sounds so rough as to seem unfinished are we really ready to get just as excited every time some new band without proventastemaker connections sends us a track like this? Still, listening to the Halloween shoegaze of \"Dirt\", the thudding violence of \"Skullcrush\", or the deadly sexual confidence of \"Whenusleep\", you can hear not just bass, but also a promising new group who like Glass Candy in the realm of afterhours Italo disco have a signature style, and now just need to develop it. Bass should be a means, not an end. "}
