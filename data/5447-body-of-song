Despite a brief return as a pop noisenik/Kevin Shields fanboy with Sugar, the majority of Bob Mould's recorded work has done more to move past this legacy than actively further it. If you're a teenager, you're primed to have your head popped off by Zen Arcade or New Day Rising. If you're inching towards 30, then you're more likely to hear Mould's music introduce \"The Daily Show\" or segue into an NPR news story. And if you're Bob Mould, you're probably splitting time spinning records at DCarea clubs and getting ready to tour behind your supposedly guitarheavy fullband album, Body of Song. If you're looking for \"Another Good Idea\" (or, God help you, \"Another Celebrated Summer\"), then you're better served giving your \"Remaster the SST Catalog\" letterwriting campaign another go. If Body of Song is anything, it's a look back on the neglected portion of Mould's musical career. As Mould phrases it in \"Best Thing\" \"This would be/ The sound of me/ Looking for some kind of closure.\" Of course, if you put an electric guitar in Bob Mould's hands, what gets put to tape will invariably be a rocklike substance. And having Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty in tow definitely helps. \"Always Tomorrow\" actually resembles the sort of slinky, grooveladen, bassheavy stuff available on recent Fugazi albums, and the storms kicked up by \"Underneath Days\" and \"Beating Heart the Prize\" give Canty a chance to bang to his heart's content. However, when Mould opts to rock out the way he used to as on Sugarlite stuff like \"I Am Vision, I Am Sound\" and \"Missing You\" the results are less favorable. And, of course, this being a Bob Mould solo album, there are ballads that ably mix Mould's awkward nasal voice with impassioned strumming and sometimes clunky lyricism. \"Days of Rain\" features a few clunkers \"If you make it clear/ Doubt will surely disappear\" but it gets the job done, building gradually to a satisfying rock outro (with the requisite Mould guitar heroics). The disarming \"Gauze of Friendship\" is a more successful endeavor, with Mould keeping the music simple (acoustic guitar, drums, and some cello offered by DCarea musician Amy Domingues) and cutting the fat from his words \"He reminds you of a boy you dated once or twice/ Just about the same size /Just about the same eyes/ The only difference being the cadence of his voice.\" For the most part, Body of Song offers the expected mix of rock tracks and balladry that one would expect from a Bob Mould solo record. There is one notable exception. \"(Shine Your) Light Love Hope\" is, for all intents and purposes, a dance track. Atop layered guitars and Canty's fervent Saturday night fever, Mould makes like a vocodered disco diva, chanting the song's title in a dreamy, wispy voice. It's unlike anything else in Mould's rock catalog, more reminiscent of the unexpected deviations that peppered his Hüskerera output (cf. \"99 Ways to Skin a Cat\", \"Reoccurring Dreams\"). It's also one of the highlights of his postHüsker career, and I don't doubt that Mould agrees on the limitededition bonus disc included with preorders of this album, there are two remixes of \"Light Love Hope\". Longtime fans of the Flying V and the sonic boom could be outraged at Mould betraying his legacy with what they'll perceive as a techno version of \"I Was Made For Loving You\". But no doubt Mould would answer this indignant outrage by telling these socalled fans when and how to kiss his distortion pedals. Press kits and biographies will impress upon readers that Mould's lasting legacy is his part in founding and shaping the fast hard rules of the alternative rock nation, giving voice to a thousand grudging young wouldbe millionaires that have long since disappeared into cutout bins. Nearly two decades removed from those iconic days, Mould has amassed a body of work that proves there's something to be said for running a slow and steady race. "}
