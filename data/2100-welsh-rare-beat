For more than three decades, a vast, hazy expanse of almostfamous rock has been synonymous with the term Nuggets; now, in addition to Children of Nuggets, we've got handy synopses of Afropop, baile funk, Brazilian postpunk, and a little something the Boston Globe recently mistyped \"reggaetron,\" plus a worldwide, weblike thing where most of it can (shh) still be had for free. On Welsh Rare Beat, Super Furry Animal Gruff Rhys and DJs Andy Votel and Dom Thomas map out the largely uncharted world of 1970s Welsh rock. It's a surprisingly diverse place. Welsh Rare Beat culls together 25, ahem, nuggets released by stillextant Welsh indie label Sain (which means, simply, \"sound\"). Stylistically the songs traverse from fuzzy garagepsych to eminently sampleable grooves, druidic ballads, eerie folk and on Huw Jones' \"Dwr\", Sain's first single, which laments the 1965 flooding of Wales' Tryweryn Valley to create a reservoir for Liverpool even tabla. The catch: As with Rhys's recent solo album, the lyrics are all in Welsh. Fortunately, Rhys provides ample liner notes for historical context. You think I learned that Tryweryn Valley shit at Pitchfork camp? The disc is laden with finds. The standout is Meic Stevens, frequently labeled the \"Welsh Bob Dylan,\" who turns in the joyous acoustic lalalas of \"Y Brawd Houdini\" (\"The Brother Houdini\") and the darker, funkier psychfolk jam \"Y Crwydryn A Mi\". Another Welsh icon, Heather Jones, makes two appearances: First Editionstyle psych trades off with undistorted, almosttwee arpeggios on \"Nos Ddu\", while the \"Sweet Home Alabama\" lead guitar intro of \"Penrhyn Gwyn\" gives way to featherpillow piano and a delicate countryish vocal. The bands Bran and Y Tebot Piws (\"The Purple Teapot\") also each make multiple welcome appearances, favoring a garagepsych bent, and the latter's cheerfully bizarre staccato footstomper \"Mae Rhywyn Wedi Dwyn Fy Nhrwyn\" (\"Someone's Stole My Nose\") was apparently sampled by DJ Cashmoney. It's been a while since Wales was deemed the next Seattle (my condolences, Montreal). Welsh Rare Beat establishes that talented Welsh bands like Catatonia, Gorky's Zygotic Minci, SFA, and even grr Manic Street Preachers hardly emerged from a vacuum. For that matter, neither did fellow Cymru son Tom Jones. While not trackfortrack jawdropping Eward H. Dalis's \"Calan Gaeaf\" bites the Doors' \"Twentieth Century Fox\" riff hard it's charming, eccentric, and decidedly endearing, like the artists it inspired. The late Titch Gwilym's fiery, Hendrixstyle instrumental rendition of Welsh national anthem \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadua\" is a final, apt example of an alternate universe whose discovery by nonWelsh listeners has been overdue.
