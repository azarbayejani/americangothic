{"label":" Deltasonic","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/1133/homepage_large.ae677586.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Ian Broudie","title":"Tales Told","text":" It's long been axiomatic that actors want to direct, journalists wish they were novelists, and rock critics end up fronting bands like Yo La Tengo (just biding my time, man). Therefore, it's not surprising when a gifted producer tries to take a star turn on the other side of the boards. But for every College Dropout, there are a thousand dustcovered copies of Mitchell Froom's Dopamine or Daniel Lanois's Shine. Former Lightning Seeds singer Ian Broudie's first release under his own name, Tales Told, is destined to languish alongside the latter releases though not before its scattered moments of pop pellucidity spark some second thoughts. This former producer for Echo and The Bunnymen as well as The Fall has never confined himself to the production desk. In fact, Broudie got his break playing guitar for Big in Japan, whose other members later joined The Slits, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Best known for his shimmering synthpop as the primary (and often sole) member of The Lightning Seeds, Broudie has taken a requisite turn toward the meditative on his first fulllength since 1999's Tilt. Gentle guitars replace bouncy Casio tones, and Broudie is more likely to whisper words of regret than recite unabashedly overthetop lyrics like \"love is the truth, I realize,\" from the Seeds' exquisite 1989 hit \"Pure\" (a clear precursor to The Postal Service's \"Such Great Heights\", in all its sappy glory). Lead single \"Song for No One\" best bridges the gap between the Seeds' infectious optimism and the new album's quiet despondency. \"I'll kiss the world with fingers crossed,\" Broudie sings over sprightly acoustic arpeggios and shaken percussion befitting The Guild League. He always had the clear, uncertain voice of an innocent, and age has only slightly rumpled its edges. At times the zaniness of Broudie's recent knobtwiddling work for fellow Liverpudlians The Coral and The Zutons seeps in, most regrettably during the closing vamp that disrupts the bright, Zombiesesque songcraft of \"Got No Plans\". Instrumental \"Super Cinema\", which opens with screeching violins and a \"Hit the Road Jack\" bassline, dances naked to the same hodgepodge 1960s rhythm as The Coral's best singles. But vaguely psychedelic lullabies like \"He Sails Tonight\" are more in line with \"Simon Diamond\" (or a glossy revamp of Pink Floyd's \"Green Is the Colour\") than, say, \"Zuton Fever\". Title track \"Tales Told\" echoes the plodding guitar, stately orchestration and, you know, title of \"Telling Tales\", from 1994 Seeds effort Jollification. \"The time for telling tales is gone,\" Broudie observes. Instead, one presumes from the repeated lyric at the end of closer \"Something Street\" \"that's how I feel\" Broudie is telling his heart. If that's the case, then he's acquitted himself admirably, but the tales were better.Tales Told lacks the charm of the Seeds' most ebullient singles, and it's certainly no Crocodiles, either. But buck up, Mr. Broudie. I mean, Tim Robbins directed Cradle Will Rock, which was pretty good, but he starred in The Player, which was better, and fuck if The Shawshank Redemption isn't on cable somewhere right now. Me? I'm still holding out for a more lucrative record deal. "}
