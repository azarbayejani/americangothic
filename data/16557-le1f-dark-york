Ball culture \"walking\" or voguing for prizes at ball events is an LGBT subculture that's been alive and dancing in New York city for over 50 years. From the very first beat Dark York paints itself as both a sleek, stylish potential soundtrack for the ball and an insistent collection of rap that feels animated by the force of its own movement. Beats are what first leap out from Dark York: From theÂ Jukelike repetitions on \"Emulator\" to the Night Slugsleaning trio of cuts produced by affiliated artist Nguzunguzu, this is a tape that feels like a census of rightnow sounds. Diouf draws from electronic music styles as much as rap and, despite seven different producers (as well as a whole clutch of his own beats), the tape hangs together impressively. Le1f matches the forwardthinking production punch for punch, coming across as a compelling and provocative rapper at every turn. On \"Bubbles\", one of the Nguzunguzuproduced cuts, he bounces lines around the beat's effervescent drops, lending the track an untethered feel. The airiness is anchored by his quickfire, provocative brags like \"straight rappers about to hate me 'cause I'm so good at this\" before warning \"Get out my zone, 'cause it's my bubble.\" On moments like this it feels like Le1f is both forging his own lane and owning it all at the same time. His isn't exactly an easy path to tread especially in a mainstream rap climate that coined its own term, \"no homo,\" just to make doubly sure any extravagance wasn't taken the wrong way. That's not to say that Diouf's music isn't just as playful as that of the mainstream. His dark, chewedup take on club sounds and party rap might pull Dark York left of center, but on a purely visceral level he also stays way in touch with rap's cathartic allure. So you get a pumpedup moment like \"Fresh\", with its huge synths and a balledup Aaliyah sample, that feels tough and club ready, but also has Diouf spitting lines like \"I'm a based goddess dipped in chocolate\" and \"How can I not throw shade with my pompous ass squadron?/ It's a unique look I call it 'handsome boy modeling.'\" Yes, Dark York is rough, and at times can feel embryonic, but there's a lot of fun to be had listening to Diouf take on rap taboos with a glint of mischief. There's a shock of the new to Le1f's showboating, too. We must have heard a million cartoonish brags in hiphop to the point where it can be easy to feel immune to them. It's curious then, and exciting, to hear lines that carry genuine boldness again. In the aforementioned NYC queer rap piece, Diouf says: \"Let's not make gay NYC rap a 'thing.'\" His approach on Dark York follows that advice, never coming across too political or selfserious; instead, Le1f's victories are won on the dancefloor, and through sheer fun.
