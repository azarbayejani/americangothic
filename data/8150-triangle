It's as if Mr. Fantastic fought Plasticman in a Marvel/DC crossover issue. And that's not even getting into the kind of triangular quarrel that could ensue if the avantrock duo, Triangles, were introduced. Though I've not listened to their music, I'm betting on the Danes. Vikings make such beautiful melodies. The real question is, which Triangle has the better lawyer, and will either band climb to any level of prominence where a lawsuit could have a foreseeable point? Again, I'm betting on Triangle DK. The debut record by Triangle US, the moronically titled *, is pretty dismissable stuff. Acoustic and hyperclean electric guitars jangle under squirting synths, as some art school grads chirp pretentious lyrics of no consequence. There's nothing egregiously wrong with the music itself it's just your average, typically mediocre Pro Tools pop with beats as crisp and thin as the crackers at a lowbudget wine and cheese party. What really sinks *, though, is the singing. The second Amanda Warner opens her reedy little throat on the first track, \"The Results,\" the show's over. Her voice is flat, with a halfhearted hitch and no emotional delivery. But wait! She's soon joined by the other 1\\xBD sides of the Triangle, Brian Tester. His voice is mildly nasal, mildly ironic, and in general, mild. Though similar in their flatness, neither singer's voice blends with the other. The vocals intertwine and trade off with zero chemistry, almost as if completely oblivious to the fact that there's another person singing. \"8:26 a.m.,\" probably the \"best\" of these tracks, explores a bit of an Afropop sound, with some bongos and shiny, clean guitar lines. If only it didn't sound like Peter Gabriel. When your thirdworld cultural exploration ends up sounding like an old British guy, you're on to nothing. There's a springy \"booooiiiing\" sound, too. (Never a good sign.) The album continues along, usually fading into white noise rather than actively irritating. If you're like me, you'll have to keep listening to it so you can vaguely describe what it sounds like. But chances are, you'll never have to listen to it, ever. Keep your fingers crossed. But enough about *. Let's get back to that battle between Mr. Fantastic and Plasticman: \"Look out, Mr. Fantastic! He's stretching!\" \"You can stretch all you want, Plasticman. You're no match for my stretching powers!\" \"Oh, yeah, Mr. Fantastic? Well, stretch your way out of this!\" \"Pretty stretchy, Plasticman, but watch out for my superstretch!\" \"Oh yeah? Stretch this!\" \"I'll stretch you, ya stretchy sonofabitch!\" Next: It's stretch time! "}
