But these solutions can't altogether make up for HTH's pallor. All seven tracks' little peaks and valleys flatten into a homogeneous plain after a few cycles through. Unpacking Walsh's lyrics is still the best part of listening to HTH; but the songs themselves, dense and overburdened, could use a little unpacking too.Read further into interviews with Walsh, and he frequently brings up Davids Lynch, Byrne, and Foster Wallace. Walsh identifies with their work and shares, in a small way, their desire to leave ends unraveled, to create scenes without pushing them toward a conclusion. This is Prepare To Qualify's unifying and best aspect. Detail and dialogue cross opening track \"Nurses 5 Float Past\", where a doctor asks, \"Is this an epilogue?\", gesturing to the interstitial qualities of EPs in general, and confusing beginnings and ends. But there are few tricks past this trickery: drums bluster under wordless choruses, smooth strings hover over sampled clips and transistor detritus. Rather than focus on the EP's standard lofi fare, you should pocket Walsh's best phrases, alliteration like \"He left with a limp and a cut on his lip\" (\"Let It Wave\"), or tongue twisters like \"Built by science/ 'The dysphemic alliance'\" (\"Cataloging Candy's Demise\"). The songs detail, in passing, Armenian waitresses, locksmiths, and doctors, but they also weave from first to third person and back. They are specific and vague at once, as if the narrator can, in overcontextualizing his surroundings, cover for his missing internal considerations. These fragmented stories even make up for the EP's ridiculous puns and long titles, like track two's \"Don't Take the Law Into Your Own Hands But Take Mine in Yours\", or \"When night falls/ Who picks it up?\" from a track of the same name.Though such verbal extravagances are occasionally forced, they're usually entertaining. In such overcrowded songs, though, redeeming moments can fall by the wayside. \"When Night Falls\" has a Steven Wrightlike pun, okay, but its chaingang vocals simply seem unnecessary, and they persist through the whole album. Prepare To Qualify could have been a more spacious record if they had occasionally abandoned the mass vocal line, but as it is, the songs, which are constricting already, feel sweltering and crowded with the additional voices.As Eric Harvey mentioned in his review of Collective Psychosis Begone, one of HTH's earliest tracks was culled from Jonathan Lethem's \"Promiscuous Materials\" project, where the novelist put up lyrics to songs he had abandoned, and left them for musicians to use as they liked. This \"Monster Eyes\" is different from the one Harvey quoted, but it remains unusually minimal for HTH. The repetitive, countrytinged waltz is menacing: \"Best thing I ever did for you/ Was get you out of range,\" Walsh sings, though its threat is softened by how distant he sounds, as though the band recorded the song to acetate. But \"Monster Eyes\", and the live closer \"(You Better Hope You) Die Before Me\" make for a nice finish because they both showcase HTH sans the bells and whistles (and strings). "}
