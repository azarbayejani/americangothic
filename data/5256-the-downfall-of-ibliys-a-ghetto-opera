Grimm was shot ten times (at once) in 1994, an attempt on his life that left him blind, deaf, comatose and almost completely paralyzed. Gradually, he was able to regain his sight, hearing, and much movement, though presently, he still requires the aid of a wheelchair to get around. In 1995, he started a record label called Day by Day Entertainment, which he currently helps run from the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island. In the 24 hours before he began serving a life sentence (stemming from conspiracynarcotics charges), he recorded his first and only fulllength record, The Downfall of Ibliys: a ghetto opera, in its entirety. Though he's still imprisoned, Grimm's label will soon release Scars & Memories (a collection of tracks from 19891994), which is also the title of the first song he wrote after waking from the coma. If that story isn't a testament to the importance of context, then I'm Noam Chomsky. MF Grimm's history alone makes Ibliys an imperative listen for both headz and musicologists; even more importantly, his vocal inflections are practically flipping over with subtext. When he raps, \"Human life is I/ Forgive him, God,\" on the album's thesis track, \"Time and Space\", a slight, cliffhanging, melancholy echo hangs on the \"God\"; the slow rhythm and piano sample beat like the heart of regret. \"To All My Comrades\" is a clipped, grave warning to Grimm's \"fallen comrades\": \"We are greater than dogs/ We are wolves/ They can't tell us what to do/ That's why they go to the park/ And we go to the zoo,\" while invoking vivid images of slavery, and environmental destruction. \"The hunt is short today,\" he raps. \"My brothers, we are now the prey.\" Grimm's tight, simple style packs punches. Though sometimes he stumbles, and the overall solid, reflective production can stray from its course (which is essentially lowkey and filled with curiously delicate pianos), each syllable resonates with a cautious intimacy, at the very least. In interviews, Grimm has said that being imprisoned is the closest a person can get to being dead without actually dying. So in a way, Downfall consists of Grimm's final words before his \"death,\" which lends an added urgency to his delivery (or at least the illusion of such). In another sense, Downfall is the tale of Grimm's descent from innocence, Ibliys being the angel who fell from the heavens. Grimm takes the high road out; rather than glorifying his lifestyle, he takes the listener through a narrative descent into the underworld, touching on philosophy, love, snitches, and unity, finally ending with the uplifting \"Omega\", and its spiritual rays of keyboards, \"meant to close the gap between what is and what ought to be.\" The story of a human befallen to the missteps of his own choices, both in real life and through his art, is ageold and deeply moving.
