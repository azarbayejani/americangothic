The bad: People will compare everything you ever make again to it. The good: Everyone will give you their best beats from here forward.So it goes on Deuces Wild, the second solo CD from Cannibal Ox alum Vast Aire. ElP is nowhere in sight, but the album takes its apocalyptic sonic cues from Cannibal Ox's 2001 classic The Cold Vein, which he produced. Many of the tracks come courtesy of Brooklyn newcomer Melodious Monk, and they are full of shimmering, goose bumpinducing samples and crashing bass. Though the show is predictably stolen by Pete Rock on \"Mecca And The Ox\" a reunion track with Cannibal Ox's Vordul Mega, which sounds like it samples not a water bong, but one of those plastic birdie whistles the beats here are universally good. Perhaps too good, because really, how are you going to have a song called \"Lunch Room Rap (It's Nothing)\" with a synth track that sounds like it was crafted during a cyborg attack in 2094?But despite the musical fireworks, Vast himself is the main reason Deuces Wild  is a return to form after the misstep that was his solo debut, Look Mom...No Hands. On that effort he was crowded by betterknown MCs and suffered from weak punchlines and a seeming lack of selfconfidence. There was no reason this should have happened; Vast is a giant man who spits from his chest, and when he's in control of his singular flow as he is throughout Deuces Wild he sounds dynamic, authoritative, funny, and sinister all at once. It's a sign of his success here that whenever any of the (mostly Blist) guest MCs come on, you're immediately pining for Vast's return.\"Take Two\" sounds something like the Flaming Lips' \"Fight Test\", and is full of sharp taunts like, \"I know piranha rap niggas that'll eat you thin,\" and \"You thought rap was dead/ Nah, you was on Prozac/ It's all your head.\" In \"Shu (The God Of Aire)\" he raps: \"I was here before man was scorned/ I was here before man was torn/ If I could finish the rhyme/ I would run around space and wrap up time.\" No, I don't know what that means, but it sounds cooler than anything RZA has been talking about recently.The album is highlighted by \"The Crush\", a raunchy schooldays reminisce about \"Karen, or was it Anetta, or was it Vanessa, Stacey, or Trecee?\" The sexual metaphors are frequent and satisfying, although some are more obvious (\"She got the sweet potato/ I got the corn on the cob\") than others. But even when he's telling jokes Vast sounds earnest, and thus the album never loses its cohesion or its edge. There's not really a bad track on Deuces Wild, although the comic book and action star references wear a bit thin (Terminator, C3PO, Indiana Jones), and there's really no need to turn himself into a superhero called \"Vast Man.\" But what's most impressive about the work is that it succeeds without succumbing to the trends of hipster rap, emo rap, or radio rap. Its only precedent is The Cold Vein, and it continues nobly in the progressive indierap mold created by ElP. "}
