I  Presetsis Kevin's fivetrack, sixteenminute billetdouxnot only to cheap preprepared sounds but also to her onetime fave guy, Miguel Trost Depedro (aka Kid 606). Kevin's got a whole lotta love to express here and she's pretty direct with it. Rather than crafting the awkward sound sculptures usually associated with her Blechdom cohort Blevin, Kevin goes straight for bargainbasement rinkydink tunes and slaps some louche lyrics on the top. The disc sounds as though it took sixteen minutes to record. It's a nofrills celebration of tacky synth modules and crude humor. Like a surly, roomquaking fart during a business meeting, I  Presetsis an antidote to the fussy highbrow IDM that garners most critical attention. Beginning with \"Interspecies Love\", a probestiality ditty stomped out on an outoftune piano, Momus' discarded drum machine, and a spastic banjo, Kevin sings, \"Mom's going to kill me when she hears this song,\" and then gets straight to the heart of the matter: \"You've got a hard shell but your belly's soft/ I'm just trying to figure out what gets you off!\" Kevin delivers these lines in a voice that's part quivering Laura Nyro and part declamatory Siouxsie Sioux. During \"Talkin' Tech\", a 47second distortedfunk slop Kevin acerbically rebukes the IDM community: \"I like the algorithms when they make the funky rhythms/ But most of the time technology don't rhyme! You're antimelody malady/ You're dismal, minimal, subliminal, delirious, selfserious/ You think you know/ But you really blow.\" But the next track, \"Mr. Miguel\", is a raunchy love song to Kid606 in which Kevin confides \"Mr. Miguel/ We're doing just swell/ And it's only getting better/ Because my pussy's feeling wetter.\" Kevin is either quite a contrarian or really digs guys who, by her own admission, blow. To orchestrate the bawdy nonsense rhyme \"Shelley Sho'nuf\", Kevin draws on Weimar cabaret, ska, and funfair organ tunes, and holds them together with a ramshackle beat. I  Presets  closes with a cover of Tina Turner's \"Private Dancer\" which exists solely to demonstrate how many presets Kevin can tinker with. She almost gets away with using the DX7 harmonica preset for a horrendous solo without causing me to retch. Yet, when she sings, it's with nearly enough passion and verve to convince me she's not being entirely sarcastic. And that's what I find so endearing about this record. Because Kevin takes far cheaper and cornier shots than Blevin, I break out Blevin's  Talom Slalom  album more often than Kevin's EP. Where Blevin's album creeps and squirms,  I  Presets  struts like a savvy hooker, turning tricks in the gutter but with her head up gazing at the stars. At the very least, Kevin has made me mildly appreciative of presets. "}
