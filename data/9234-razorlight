{"label":" Universal","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/9074/homepage_large.1a8ed4f6.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Adam Moerder","artist":"Razorlight","title":"Razorlight","text":" With that whole turnofthecentury garage rock new world order thing already in its bleak postapocalyptic stage, the second and thirdtier nugarage bands are now left fighting for their relevancy and survival. Like failed revivalists Soundtrack of Our Lives, French Kicks and, to a lesser extent, the Raveonettes, Razorlight entered pop's ken with a flourish. They were Up All Night, bestowing us with glimpses of London nightlife at its most chic and youthful. Their shtick, lifeless and constructed from their contemporaries' leftover parts, lacked the originality of the Raveonettes' draconian B flat key signatures but looked purdy enough to the tune of a millionplus records sold. Funny then that this bland selftitled followup finds these guys seemingly disillusioned and full of ennui. Almost as a defense mechanism for their disproportionate successtotalent ratio, Razorlight's decided to not only turn their amps down, they're angling to dissociate themselves from the garagerock scene entirely, playing pensive where they previously partied. There's a lot of attempts at answering the who, what, where, whens, and hows of love not to mention a boatload of soulsearching and awkward selfawareness. Even worse, they've jettisoned nearly all their Strokes, Television, and other grab bag postpunk propensities, turning instead to adult alternative as a foundation for this late20s midlife crisis. I guess if ya can't beat 'em, just quit and make soft rock! Opener \"In the Morning\" shows the band toeing the line between sprightly garage rock and \"mature,\" reflective grownup pop. While the band cops a Franz Ferdinand swagger, the crime here lies in frontman Johnny Borrell's woeisme pathos, a stab at \"so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\"levels of profundity. Problem is, in his pot/kettle words it's \"The songs on the radio sound the same/ Everybody just looks the same.\" Plus, on lines like, \"Remember when you were young?\", the 26yearold's wistfully recounting the Up All Night days when \"every night's still so much fun.\" Are we supposed to believe Borrell leads a boring life now? \"Who Needs Love?\" seems to indicate this is the case. It's a limp take on Springsteen's \"Hungry Heart\" that espouses a totally opposite message. Borrell tweaks his vocals for a bareboned, Brit Daniel delivery on a song that rejects romance and compassion.  Sadly, those lyrical disasters take place on the album's stronger songs. While not nearly as blasphemous, tracks like \"America\" and \"Fall to Pieces\" scrape the bottom of the barrel, the former sounding even tackier than the Neil Diamond song of the same name, while the latter sounds like romantic comedy soundtrack fodder, an amalgamation of 90s \"altrock\" sensations such as Counting Crows and the Rembrandts. What gall then when they update R.E.M.'s classic \"Pop Song 89\" to \"Pop Song 2006\", a slapdash salute to the Athens group with the flag at half mast. Of course, such braggadocio's expected when Borrell's actually convinced he's our generation's Dylan. He's right too, although he should've specified Jakob and not Bob. "}
