Aimee Argote and Tim Herzog make few intimations of companionship on their debut album, Loose Lips Sink Ships. When they do, it's in songs like \"No More Fighting Cats, OK\", which reads like a neofeminist signpost on Revolutionary Road. \"You scrub that smell off of your body/ Have dinner with the family/ Start picking me up on time/ Stop taking my car when I tell you that it's mine for the night,\" sings a livid Argote. Hardly loveydovey, and neither is the sound. Dark and jangly, Des_Ark manage to be as loud as any larger band, but with the added intensity of their compensatory bashing. Being at an inherent disadvantage volumewise is actually a boon for many resourceful twopieces especially those brandishing just guitar and drums. Strippeddown bands like Mates of State and the White Stripes (for whom balancing and mixing are less complicated endeavors than for, say, the Polyphonic Spree) can crank up the volume and utterly wail. Communication also becomes easier when there are fewer tastes to satisfy and voices to be heard. Unsurprisingly, then, Des_Ark are tight as Scarlet O'Hara's corset. Jammy influences pervade their screeching geetaranddrums rock, but not in the traditional sense of unchecked soloing and rampant key changes. They're more scripted, nailing impressionistic oddmeter pirouettes and directing traffic through rhythmically congested passages. Argote and Herzog may have some skills, but they ain't above the Rules of Rock, which clearly stipulate that you ought not overdissect your hooks, else they cease to live. Save standouts \"No More Fighting Cats, OK\" and \"Jesus Loves You (But Yr Still Comin' Home With Me Tonight)\", which turn in Loose Lips' stickiest vocal hook and most anthemic guitar line, respectively, Des_Ark are too preoccupied with pummel and contortion to offer palliative melodies. The album is forbiddingly opaque and often brutally heavy for the idiom indie rock under which it will probably be categorized. With only eight songs, you have to wonder if Des_Ark sensed it was all a bit overpowering. Even at a slender 28 minutes the album can be a slog. But then, controlled chaos seems to be their M.O. (much as it was for producer and former Dinosaur Jr. leading man J Mascis), and by that standard they're a roaring success. "}
