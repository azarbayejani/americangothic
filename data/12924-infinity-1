If you stop and think about it, there doesn't seem to be a very complicated agenda behind the best ones: keep the rhythmic momentum consistent, shift the tone or mood at the right moment for emphasis, transition between tracks in a nondisruptive way, and cover enough stylistic ground to avoid tedium without going too far and coming across as a disjointed, genrehopping traffic jam. It's music designed for moving, and if the people are moving, then technically it works. But there's a difference between going to hear someone DJ at a club and actually investing in a mix CD: in the latter case, there's that extra burden of permanence, of knowing that someone will pull this off their shelf or their hard drive years from now as a snapshot of a moment in sound.Infinity +1 says something in that respect: if you want an hour's worth of what constitutes the midpoint between popular and underground dance music at the end of this decade, call ATrak. Between his Kanye West cred, his facility with a wide spectrum of club music subgenres, his recent history of quality releases like Dirty South Dance, and his justout entry into the FabricLive series, he's established himself as a favorite among the shuttershades generation, and for good reason. He's great at putting familiar styles into interesting contexts, blurring lines between eras, and just plain knowing what tracks sound good next to each other. Infinity +1 is an enjoyable exhibition of those skills, even if it's not particularly outlandish in its celebration of modern (and a little classic) electro and house.The mix isn't without its personality, of course: It opens with Shel Silverstein reading his poem \"Invitation\" (\"If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar/ A hopeer, a prayer, a magic bean buyer/ If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire\"), then segues into John Dahlbäck's chirpy, upbeat \"Sidewalk\" with accompaniment by an astronomydocumentary voiceover relaying the life cycle of a maturing star. Not like this is ATrak's big grownup artistic statement, though, even if he does pay respect to his elders via Lifelike's electrofied remix of Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk's 1986 house classic \"Love Can't Turn Around\" and Alexander Robotnick's 83 Italo cult smash \"Problemes d'Amour\". For the most part, it's a succession of names you might've seen if you keep up with the right labels, or at least the MP3 blog discodust: Holy Ghost! (\"Hold On\"), DJ Mehdi (\"Pocket Piano\"), Little Boots (\"Stuck on Repeat\", remixed by Fake Blood) and, a few times, ATrak himself, both as remixer (Sébastien Tellier's \"Kilometer\"; MSTRKRFT's N.O.R.E.featuring \"Bounce\") and remixee (DJ Spinna reworking his deathless \"Say Whoa\").Yet as familiar as these tracks might be to scenesters, they're even more familiar to ATrak he knows their ins and outs so deeply he has the exact knowledge of where they most effectively overlap. The beatmatching on Infinity +1 is immaculate, hiding the seams so well that he creates brief pockets of mashup serendipity: The newwave dance rock bassline of Midnight Juggernauts' \"Shadows\" dovetails neatly into the stuttering vocal intro to the Boys Noize remix of Gonzales' \"Working Together\", and K.I.M.'s burbling synthpopmeetsDetroit techno throwback \"Party Machini\" gets snuck up on by Laurent Wolf's \"The Crow\" to create a monster tandem bassline. And even though the overall tenor of the mix might be familiar, clubfriendly electrohouse, ATrak shows his range by flavoring it with modern hiphouse crossover (\"Bounce\"; Donnis'BmoremeetsATL \"Party Works\"; new Kid Sister track \"Life on TV\") and concluding it with the pastoral, acoustic guitardriven Prins Thomas remix of James Yuill's \"This Sweet Love\". There's been better mixes this year ATrak's own Fabriclive.45 amongst them but if you want to stick evidence of life in early 2009 into a time capsule for exhuming a decade later, Infinity +1 will put this era in a positive light.
