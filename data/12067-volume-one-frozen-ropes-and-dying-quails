The game boasts more esoteric lore than the combined histories of the Residents and Jandek, and has given us more colorful characters than Elephant 6. It sometimes requires (and rewards) the same amount of faith and patience as a Stars of the Lid record.One other thing baseball and indie rock are both places where guys can still get paid for doing \"kid\" stuff into middle age. As with Julio Franco or Jamie Moyer, so it goes for Peter Buck (R.E.M.), Steve Wynn (the Dream Syndicate), and Scott McCaughey (the Young Fresh Fellows, Minus 5), the altrock vets and principals behind the Baseball Project, a diamondthemed endeavor responsible for the wonderfully lively and humane Volume One: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails. Poring through hardball's rich history with the exhaustiveness of true geeks but the wit and empathy of born songwriters, Wynn and McCaughey repeatedly manage to draw effortless metaphorical lines between baseball and life.For one, the game, like life, is full of men who are bitter, forgotten, and misunderstood. Most of the record's songs focus on one specific player, and Wynn and McCaughey are particularly fascinated by pioneers and scapegoats, guys who either made a sacrifice without commensurate reward (Jackie Robinson, Curt Flood) or who suffered unduly for committing a common transgression (Mark McGwire, Jack McDowell). Of course, the biggest danger with this sort of individualized approach lies in reducing the game's most famous and infamous figures to biographical caricatures, a fair criticism of \"Jackie's Lament\", which unimaginatively posits that Robinson would rather have been remembered as a ballplayer than a hero. \"Gratitude (For Curt Flood)\" could have been a similarly predictable summingup, but the anger Wynn musters for baseball's first free agent keeps the tribute raw and interesting, evoking the image of \"wellpaid slaves\" while reciting a laundry list of today's hugelycompensated stars (ARod, Barry Zito, and the like) who owe Flood a spiritual debt.Songs like these and the clemency plea for McGwire, \"Broken Man\", may remind us that baseball isn't insulated from injustice and regret, but Wynn and McCaughey also find within the game symbols for the fleeting joys and happy quirks that make life worth living. Riding bright pop hooks and gleefully bashy garagerock rhythms, the pair revel in the glorious iconoclasm of legends like Satchel Paige, Fernando Valenzuela and especially the immortal Ted Williams, whom Wynn nails perfectly in a wonderful portrayal of \"The Splendid Splinter\"'s lovably cantankerous sense of his own unsurpassed greatness.Charming as unforgettable characters like these (as well as hardluck perfectgamer Harvey Haddix) may be, there remains one sobering fact common to all baseball careers at some point, they end. On the factscrammed opener \"Past Time\", wistfully Whoish \"Long Before My Time\" and martial \"The Closer\", Wynn and McCaughey suggest the ephemerality of all things, be they moments of glory or shame, or entire careers and lives themselves. These two rock lifers clearly found meaning and joie de vivre in music long ago, and it's clear that baseball too has bestowed not only a bond, but also its own share of lessons both cautionary and affirmative.
