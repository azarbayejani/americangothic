Whereas collectors of rare funk records wade through dusty crates for that groove and club DJs search for a competitive edge via rarity and minutiae, the only litmus test for a psych artifact appears to be \"does it sound cool?\" This binary qualification is presumably how we end up with Galactic Zoo Dossier #7's 2xCD set of rare material, a compilation that skips from heavy metal blues to high school free jazz to funky techno. GZD #7 is a handwritten and illustrated zine that offers, in addition to trading cards, a surprisingly professional twodisc mix: Teenage Meadows of Infinity: Rare Psychs and Stomps, nominally \"old and heavy,\" and From the Ashes Perfect Attainment Shall Be: Modern Freaked Sounds, or \"recent and weird.\" The results are an exhaustive gathering that slots the Stooges, Devendra Banhart, and Charalambides alongside a barrelful of relative unknowns. The comp's flashing neon advertisement is a full version of \"Cock in my Pocket\", an oftbootlegged Stooges outtake whose Little Richard piano riff and straightlaced vocal remain the some of group's most unimpeded concessions to early rock'n'roll. It's a lovely coup for a tiny rag, but GZD #7's strength lies in its unearthing of deeply rare treasures, several of which hail from GZD's hometown of Chicago. Gollum kicks Teenage Meadows off with the skuzzy abandon of \"Prayer of Despair\" while the Outspoken Blues nominate \"Turn on Your Lovelight\" for the \"Hey Joe\"HallofSongsYouCan'tRuin. The Wheeling High School Jazz Band had a wildass conductor who shepherded the kids to avantswing nonsense. From the Ashes provides more home cooking still: Zappafried blues from Plastic Crimewave Sound (whose Steve Krakow edits the magazine and helped compile this material), amplifier drone from White/Light, and a jokey Chicago Transit Authority cover from an Acid Mothers Temple Empty Bottle performance. Of the more recognizable names here, Banhart turns over a toolong unreleased side that is nonetheless homey and unhinged while the Charalambides contribute a pleasingly aggressive 1995 live performance. De Stijl revival projects Michael Yonkers and Ed Askew are good for a fierce, noisy 2005 demo and a pleasant, clavierfed folk song, respectively. Solid contributions, all, but GZD earns its merit badge with tracks from bands whose stories start with \"someone sent this in\" and end with \"from who knows when or where.\" This is endemic on Teenage Meadows, which includes all manner of bearded ladies: deeply scratched garage rock nugget from \"Unknown Acetate\", a powerboogie strut \"Don't Hold Back\" from unknowns Crowd + 1 and bizarrely, a 30strong teenage girl ukulele orchestra that sounds like a Saturday morning cartoon nestled in near the end of the disc's moldy runtime. The oddities are cute, but a 37track, twoandahalf hour set should ideally offer more in the way of true standouts, especially because GZD #7 is too harebrained and geekedout to paint a holistic picture of any one scene or sound; its joyous, inclusive tendency cuts both ways, naturally. This is excess in its most benign and goodnatured state, though, and for a group of people already invested in Clive Palmer's solo career and Michelle Phillips trading cards, there's only one crucial question, and the answer is yes: It sounds pretty damn cool.
