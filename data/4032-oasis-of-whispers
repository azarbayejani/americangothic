Another muttering, banging, squealing fiveyearold live jazz album from Buffalo, NY, played by the pros, Oasis of Whispers is a September 2001 performance that finds Canadian multiinstrumentalist Glen Hall blowing through an assortment of saxes, flutes, and clarinets in collaboration with \"loft scene\" freejazz OG William Hooker, and Lee Ranaldo, founding member of Sonic Youth and former guitartuner for Glenn Branca. The hook, if it's there: A single moment, probably spontaneous, but fully formed. And if not, then something so wild it briefly lunges out of the clattering background. From the jazz end, Sonny Rollins' \"Blue Seven\" bop gets sauced up on loose Hooker drums, and flexes with Ranaldo guitar skronk, but hey, Rollins did it for 10 minutes at least, and these guys only make it for fiveplus. Tradition is unquestionably the back door of this stuff, so besides flashing cred, the results are best when the players slide off to the side: Check out the marathon \"Conference Call\", which weaves answering machine messages, Pauline Oliveroslike vocalizing, and beat poetry into a schizophrenic, saxophoneled charge into the subconscious. The trio earns its keep here, wrestling drama from some truly mundane shit. (\"I'm checking the schedule\"... \"we just pulled into Seattle\"... \"a man lies on the beach.\") But the flipside applies, too. Free jazz, as it's played on \"The Mechanism\", is three guys going to war with each other \"my sax,\" \"my fucking drum fill,\" \"fuck it, I'm shouting\" and it flattens every dimension. This was a live set: \"Mechanism\" was the warm up. No way to feel the ghost but to try, but the id doesn't arrive until \"Eyemote\", expressed as insect sounds and mouthpiece muttering: \"It's not my fault I'm Catholic. I was born this way.\" Now there's an idea.Oasis of Whispers might be all fighting in the trenches if not for its monster title track. The sex jam on an otherwise boy's club afternoon, \"Oasis of Whispers\" withholds, prolongs, and growls. Hall purrs; a kazoo sounds; Ranaldo does subaudible mood electronics and delay; Hooker hits and backs off; they simultaneously give space and get right up in the face of the thing. Restraint compels, and this track owns because they own every second. Longing for the hard core is what haunts the rest of the record. Getting worked up is hot for the players and hot for the played to, but rarely at the same time: When Hall/Ranaldo/Hooker hit the gas pedal, the backseat nods off; only when they get quiet do the kids wake up and notice.
