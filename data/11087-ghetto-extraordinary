{"label":" Sony","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/10869/homepage_large.59ad09d7.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Killer Mike","title":"Ghetto Extraordinary","text":" Listening to Ghetto Extraordinary, it's easy to imagine the perpetually cantankerous Killer Mike nodding in agreement with Daniel Plainview's beachfront lament from There Will Be Blood: There are times when he looks at people and sees nothing worth liking. His second LP for Sony is a bracing throwback of sorts to the angryman hiphop that got me started in 1991 or so, back when Ice Cube, Treach, Willie D, and Chuck D rewrote the rules of \"conscious rap\" to incorporate the conscious desire to knock some sense into you. And while Ghetto Extraordinary could possibly have been seen as a refinement of 2006's monstrous, trendchasing I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind mixtape, there's one sad irony that hangs over these volatile narratives; Killer finished recording unaware that he'd have to give it away on the internet almost three years later just to let it see the light of day. As Scott Plagenhoef wrote in his \"Through the Cracks\" column earlier this month, getting the shit end of the stick from a major often results in kneejerk critical sympathy, but it's not like Sony missed out on a Dixie Hotel Foxtrot here Ghetto Extraordinary is all over the place, and while it's not particularly jarring for a record you can download for free, as a major release, it can certainly be seen as a victim of overeager retooling. In the event that it does gain a reputation as a buried treasure, it won't be a result of the bougie Jagged Edge track, \"Niggaz Down South\"'s serviceable but reductive traphop or David Banner's umpteenth cannibalization of the \"Rubberband Man\" beat (\"AyeO\"). What makes the delay of this thing so curious is how it manages to open a time warp into the year it was supposed to drop; considering his debut Monster went gold, it's hard to believe this wouldn't have made sense in a year when the public was enamored with all things Atlanta. Drums go off like mortar rounds on the clubrazing \"Get 'Em Shawty\", a reminder that Three 6 Mafia used to produce some of the most frightening music in hiphop before they limited their palette to Willie Hutch samples (granted, the second half does interpolate their colossal beatdown anthem \"Who Run It\"). Meanwhile, \"Gorilla Pimpin'\" is one of the few beats of the 21st century that 8ball & MJG sound comfortable on and even the track featuring estranged partner Big Boi (\"My Chrome\") could pass for a budget \"The Way You Move\". But the emotional core of Ghetto Extraordinary can be found in \"Bad Day/Worst Day\"'s two and a half minutes of epic negation; less than 60 seconds in, Mike has called out C. Dolores Tucker, Bill O'Reilly, Al Sharpton, Kobe Bryant, BET, MTV, the new hos on \"Soul Train\", and the old hos on \"Soul Train\". It's no mere bitchfest, even if it barely stays on the rails his insights on hiphop go from trenchant (\"Q Tip singin', 'dre 3000 actin'/ Goddamn niggaz too good for this rappin'?\") to hopelessly lame (\"We went from 'too black, too strong'/ To Sisqo and the goddamn Thong Song'\"), before excoriating the church (\"I'd rather let Eminem call me 50 niggaz/ Than break bread with a rich nigga readin' scripture\") and making an openended claim about sharing the same birthday as Hitler.  Mike manages to sell these contradictions, not so much as a manner of charisma, but in the way his authoritative bark bullies his thoughts into line. \"Mama Said\" starts out evoking Biggie's \"Everyday Struggle\" (\"I'm sick of waking up fucked up\"), but as opposed to being a revelation about his foul lifestyle, his remorse comes from having no product to sell. By the end, his issues with the opposite sex have him espousing Chris Rockstyle sympathy for his longdeparted father and O.J. Simpson but he closes with pointed words for wouldbe trappers (\"Throw the book at your black ass for cocaine/ I got a partner who ain't coming home til LeBron James in the Hall of Fame\").  Not that Ghetto Extraordinary lacks a sense of humor. \"Gonna Go to Ghana\" pumpfakes as bullshit Dead Prez posturing before Mike puns off his atlas over the limber, Zapped out funk of Andre 3000. Even the police brutality dissection of \"Shot Down\" is all the more effective for its caustic oneliners: \"I'm a young black male, that's a deadly profession/ Got more gun questions ask Charlton Heston.\" It's one of the many times you can practically hear the classic vitriol of Ice Cube, at least until he shows up for the remix of \"Bad Day/Worst Day\". Cube famously cast himself as a rapper you love to hate, even if anyone who listened to his records couldn't help but love or at least admire him, period. If Killer wants it, he might be the second coming; by nature of its circumstances, Ghetto Extraordinary can't help but feel comparatively minor, but when he's hitting his targets this often, Killer Mike demands you make way for the South's prophet of rage.
