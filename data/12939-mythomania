{"label":" Asthmatic Kitty","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/13936/homepage_large.24ced1a1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Adam Moerder","artist":"Cryptacize","title":"Mythomania","text":" Here's the paradox of Chris Cohen's postDeerhoof canon: We love its infantile, geegollymister tone, yet his better work is usually celebrated as sounding \"grown up\" or \"mature,\" literally and/or figuratively. On the last album from the Curtains, another of his former bands, Cohen finally wrangled his Pandora's box of ideas into structured songs, and the group's growth smacked of something like developmental biology. Founded with singer Nedelle Torrisi, Cryptacize prods Cohen into more \"adult\" territory, though the group's debut still evinced cringeworthy cuteness in songs like \"Cosmic Singalong\", which contained the mantra \"Every note is an unfinished song.\" Considering Cohen's penchant for penning so much loose, unfinishedsounding material, that's a tough ethos to get behind. Fortunately, Mythomania resurrects the gravitas Cohen contributed to The Runners Four while also retaining a childlike sense of wonder.Conjuring the sounds of the 1960s and 70s has always been Cohen's bread and butter, but on Mythomania the interpretation carries more weight. While Curtains and Crypticize's debut Dig That Treasure mostly espoused an eerily upbeat, almost cultlike take on psych rock, shit feels realer here. Mythomania isn't holding hands and drinking KoolAid, it's tripping on acid and pondering the great questions of the cosmos. Listening to \"Galvanize\"'s chilly space operatics or the moody windmill guitar strumming on \"The Loving Sun\" recalls the moments on Cohenera Deerhoof albums where the band's classic rock side gushed out, revealing a subconscious desire to make another Led Zep II.Not to be outshined, Torrisi logs a commendable effort in her expanded vocal role. The slithering melodies on \"Tail & Mane\" and \"Blue Tears\" capture The Zombies and Love at their most infectious, though not without throwing the listener a fair share of necromantic curveballs. Even the title track's saccharine verse is salvaged by a killer refrain, a tweelike acuteness that the band's previous material lacked. The normally phlegmatic Cohen offers moments of poignancy, too, most notably on the pretty phenomenological crisis ballad \"What You Can't See Is\". (Its opening line \"Part of me/ You're only seeing part of me\" is the album's tenderest moment.)Finding unique ways to handle empty space and unorthodox arrangements has always been Cohen's greatest strength, and here that skill helps to mottle his most straightforward material to date. Mythomania isn't without its dry patches, but the orchestration never resorts to the same trick twice, but rather props up the album's more mediocre pop tunes. That's a far cry from the wonky sound collages that plagued early Curtains albums, and an indication that the group, with its members seemingly crawling into new shells every few months, has finally found a habitat to do some of that artistic maturing we're always notsosecretly hoping for.
