{"label":" Fat Sandwich","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/16685/homepage_large.87de979e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brandon Soderberg","artist":"Cities Aviv","title":"Digital Lows","text":" Cities Aviv begins \"Fuckeverybodyhere\" with a swaggering declaration: \"I could say some chill shit, but fuck all that.\" Given the song's hazy productionSteely Dan's \"Midnight Cruiser\" hammered into jagged boombap the impulse to lapse into laconic stoner rap makes sense, but nothing plays out quite so predictably on Digital Lows. And so, in a drunken RZAlike flow, the Memphis rapper narrates his heroic origin story (\"Bluff City born with a mic in my palm, I came up out the womb spittin' in the rarest of form\"), hilariously bigups himself (\"In this 8bit world I'm Bowser\"), and mockingly croons the song's shittalk title. Even the usual hiphop clich√©s are afforded specificity thanks to his expressive wit and precise determination not to use words in the same exact way as every other rapper. He describes the girls he's pulling in by joking, \"as a youngin' jerkin' off I could never picture this,\" and refers to his haters as \"voyeurs.\" Dude's got personality. He's a conflicted, searching thinker, with an outsider/insider perspective that merges the personal and the political, and lashesout against the street mentality that mocks his forwardthinking hiphop. \"Niggas say I dress white,\" he observes a little hurt, and retorts, \"flow must be cocaine.\" He also makes a joke about \"white bitches\" whose \"favorite band is Mr. Bungle,\" which is just really funny. A few years ago this would be derisively called \"hipster rap,\" but that kind of categorical thinking has been pleasantly deconstructed by now. Digital Lows also has a group of outofnowhere, brilliant producers (Muted Drone, RPLD GHOSTS, Danny Dee, and others) behind it, all of whom contribute imaginative but still traditionalist beats. \"Black Box\" gives Gil ScottHeron's \"Winter in America\" a blunted beatmaker refix. \"Die Young\" loops the intro to Depeche Mode's \"People Are People\" and turns the new wave classic into a hybrid of Rammellzee's avantrap and Southern fightrap. Three 6 Mafia's subtle influence on this nextgeneration Memphis rapper always manifests itself in subtle, indirect ways like that. \"A Beautiful Hell\", \"Doom x Gloom\", and \"sixsixsixes\" invoke Three 6 shock rap at moments when Cities, usually thoughtful and witty, sounds at the end of his rope, far beyond \"fuck it\" so he lets loose with lines like, \"we fuck broads on the cross and they gulp the semen.\" For contrast, placed between \"Doom x Gloom\" and \"sixsixsixes\" is \"Meet Me on Montrose (For ExLovers Only)\", a bittersweet love story based on a sample of \"Oh Lori\" by the Alessi Brothers, which is quite possibly the least \"hard\" song ever made. \"Voyeurs\" lobs goofy disses at fellow rappers (\"In a city full of fake Rick Rosses/ I rock Cuban link chains with inverted crosses\") and ends with a burst of digitized noise before giving way to hopeful album closer \"Float On\", a wizened freestyle over Blackbird Blackbird's cover of the Modest Mouse hit. Balance is important here, and the darkest moments of Digital Lows soon enough let up to highlight Cities Aviv's most winning quality: his mordant humanity. "}
