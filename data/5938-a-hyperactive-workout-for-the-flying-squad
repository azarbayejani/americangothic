In gym class, even if you're not that athletic you can still get that \"A\" by looking absolutely titillated during racquetball, and a little flaky bullshitting never hurt in job interviews (\"Oh yes, I have a passion for burger flipping!\"). And, of course, a little gusto never hurt in rock music. Without it Ocean Colour Scene would still be shambling from gig to gig in Birmingham, yet something's fishy about their sixth album's cocksure title. Don't get me wrong; they love their rock, but there's nothing \"hyperactive\" about them creatively. Guitarist Steve Cradock has undoubtedly logged countless hours absorbing classic rock fakebooks, and singer Simon Fowler attacks every song like a karaoke fiend a telling likeness considering three songs here are covers and several more could be misconstrued as such. How else could Fowler do his best Steve Perry on \"Another Time to Stay\" and then ape Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy on \"Have You Got the Right\", or Cradock unironically play the spandexladen arena rock riff on \"Everything Comes at the Right Time\"? Then again, there's no reason to expect a change. Ever since Liam Gallagher dubbed them \"the secondbest band in Britain\" (after Oasis, obviously) in the midnineties, OCS have milked a Muscle Shoals/Small Faces/Mod rock fusion with little deviation but plenty of aplomb. Single \"Free My Name\" flaunts fiddles, banjos, and campfire harmonies like a musical cousin of Rod Stewart's \"Maggie May\". The thoughtlessly titled \"I Love You\", but Fowler's fervent theatrics almost dupe you into thinking he just invented the monster ballad. Occasionally their zeal pays off. \"Free My Name\" impeccably emulates the Spector sound and Fowler's got the pipes to pull off a respectable Motown howl. The cover of George Harrison's \"Wha Wha\" shows good taste, but (sigh) overeager beefy guitars and stadiumsized drumming detract from the luscious vocal hook. I've rooted for these guys because they nearly achieve that fine mix between tackiness and genius perfected by bands like T. Rex and the Darkness. Unfortunately, I can only give them points for effort. "}
