{"label":" Chicks on Speed","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/1431/homepage_large.e8089f73.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Cameron Macdonald","artist":"Chicks on Speed","title":"Press the Space Bar","text":" \"History will outlive us!/ History will forgive us!/ History will forget us!,\" one Chick shouts in the middle of a sadomasochistic session, as if choking on the meaninglessness of all the sexual politics about the roles of domination/submission. \"They call you a bitch/ You become a sales pitch!\" some bloke chimes in. Those moments planted in \"History Will Outlive Us\", a surfrock romp set to a brokenknuckled electro thud, are the most poignant on Press the Space Bar, a mess of an album by Chicks on Speed and their Spanish collaborators, the No Heads. Posttechno celebrity Cristian Vogel of Super_Collider manned the production that, oddly for him, seems to be recorded in a metal shop. The Chicks Kiki Moorse, Melissa Logan and AlexMurray Leslie are still typecast as \"artschool punks,\" even though they gave up college long ago. The stigma is fair\\xD0 making a career from an avantgarde statement about Information Age decadence in the form of Reaganera trash, \"DoItYourself\" synthpop, and tacky clothing...well, it's tough to break away from one's public image when that's what you've built your music around. Being embalmed in an Electroclash\\xAA specimen jar does not help either, but to the Chicks' credit, they largely depart from the discountshop techno for a ramshackle noiserock band. Opener \"The Household Song,\" is an oldfashioned, feminist shooting gallery jaunt. On a skiffle groove, the Chicks wag their fingers at the homemakers' life, singing about the pleasures of cooking, dusting, and breeding with quotation marks spraypainted over it all. \"They say emancipation/ 'Go out and work'/ But I just want to stay home and do my housework!\" they deadpan. The tune is a quaint romp, given that we now live in a time when homemaking is an economic luxury. The following \"Mitte Bitte\" keeps the momentum with a gritty roadhousepunk guitar riff and vocals switchbladed in German. But then \"Class War\" arrives and the album loses its fingers, toes, limbs, and then its head. The Chicks and the band want to declare a revolt against the bourgeois, while lollygagging in front of the television. The smeared din of broadcasted news clutter the recording as the band fiddles with a vague blues, and a Chick reads Chomskylite descriptions of how the crooked politicians are screwing Us over. They then break into a hardcore calltoarms that pales to Fear's trashier and more visceral hardcore punk oldie, \"Let's Have a War\". The first part of \"Culture Vulture\" is an amusing for its sloppy tape manipulation and cartoonish basslines as the Chicks decry attention deficit disorder as our consumer society's disease. But elsewhere, the album is marred by malfunctioned, artnoise experiments with unoiled buzzsaw guitars, CBradio broadcasts of spokenword pieces, and digital clutter. The most successful lab results are \"Madelyn Albrights Answer\", with its engrossing house groove and coalsmoked synth drones, and the cascading, bowed drones that barely forgive the poetry of \"My Pony\". There, the pretension is so rich. One Chick deadpans, \"When you're hungry, you eat/ When you're tired, you go to sleep.\" She repeats the mantra so many times and with so little sincerity that there is a moment where she utters, \"uh\" before pushing herself to say those damned words.
