Ed is \"quirky\" in other words, nonthreatening, mildly funny and dismissable. Detractors of Clem Snide accuse the band of the same flaws: Eef Barzelay's songs dare you not to take them too seriously, as they use clever wordplay (\"Joan Jett of Arc\"), picturesque settings (\"Dairy Queen\"), and most damning of all, pop culture references to drive that home. The listener has to pay closer attention to see how these lighter elements front serious statements. \"Moment in the Sun\" is a bright, euphoric song: from the easygoing guitar line that opens it, to the horn fanfare and big finish, it tries to make you feel good. And yet Barzelay's lyrics are sardonic, making fun of emptyheaded dogooders: \"I think that hunger, war and death are bringing everybody down,\" he sings, mocking the hippie types who don't understand why everything has to be so hard. Barzelay claims to have written it about that pop yodelerturnedpoetess, Jewel, but he turns it around yet again. As he imitates what he's making fun of, he sings with uncommon gusto. \"When it's my moment in the sun/ Oh, how beautiful I'll be,\" he belts with conviction, and you wonder if he isn't making fun of himself and if he is, why he's enjoying it so much. The EP includes two versions of the single: the album version, and a shorter, less effective radio edit that fades out before the big finish. The other reissued material is a remix of \"Your Favorite Music,\" from their album of the same name. Master Cylinder and the Fruit Key give the song a plusher synth background and some cheesy sax fills; it adds some bounce to the melody, though it doesn't surpass the simpler, gorgeous original. There are also three new tracks, all solo recordings by Barzelay: two with acoustic guitar, and one that adds keyboards and a drum machine. \"Now the Moment's Gone\" is unexpectedly vicious: he bears down on his guitar and turns the chorus into an unfettered sneer. Even the jokes \"Now the costume party's ended/ Will the ghost return your call?\" make the song meaner instead of lighter. On \"I Believe Your Lies,\" he sings the line in the title but trails off to indicate how conditional the statement is; his voice conveys a guarded vulnerability. \"Do You Love Me\" may be one of his least enjoyable songs, but only because it's so honest: he whines through the verse, asking a girl if she loves him or hates him but implying that their relationship has just gone stale. These songs are more direct and raw than his earlier solo features. And as always, he wraps his sentiments in ambiguity and good lyrics. Clem Snide's appearance on \"Ed\" has yet to turn them into America's New Sweethearts. Though they've probably won new fans, many of the show's viewers have been turned off by the new song: the \"Ed\" fan sites are full of attacks, listing all of the animals you could strangle that would sound like Barzelay. Even Snide fans could admit that Barzelay's voice is not commonly beautiful, but the real problem may be that his vocals are challenging and complicated: they're definitely too interesting for a TV theme song. Clem Snide may seem idiosyncratic, but they know how to transcend that to create something meaningful and this slim EP, a memento of their first brief moment of nationwide fame, proves it as powerfully as any of their albums.
