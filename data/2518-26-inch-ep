{"label":" Lex","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/2496/homepage_large.2e813d0c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Rollie Pemberton","artist":"Danger Mouse","title":"26-Inch EP","text":" There are few things more difficult than recommending an EP. The concept of the extended player is adverse to positive results in either of its two incarnations: the fullyrealized EP that is developed to display a genuine change of direction for an artist, or the EP that bunches together several oddities or remixes in a grab for additional spending. In the case of Danger Mouse and Jemini's newly reissued (and repackaged) 26 Inch EP, the collection unfortunately leans closer to the latter. The talent is here, although the cast of characters don't seem to have much of interest to say. Repeated verses from The Alkaholiks, as well as CeeLo's decision to forgo rapping entirely to sing the chorus of \"What U Sittin' on Remix\" are early disappointments, while Sadat X phones in a stilted verse on \"Ghetto Pop Life Remix\", continuing the trail of missed opportunities. Jemini's new verses, too, while strongly delivered, are lyrically disappointing: He spends \"The Shit\" praying to the god of selfaggrandization, who is described not only as \"the shit,\" but also \"the boss,\" \"a bad motherfucker,\" \"the Incredible Hulk,\" and, on a particularly good day, \"the Son of God.\" \"Ghetto Pop Life II\" is the disc's strongest remix, giving the anthemic original more of an A.M. radio overhaul. Light string flourishes and subtle keyboard wash over the listener, while Jemini juxtaposes quickly spun, lowtoned verses with soulful crooning reminiscent of The Pharcyde. And he kills it, too: \"Some might question my openness/ I'm not your average mediocre local vocalist.\" The thing that sets this song apart from the others on the EP is the way in which elements of the original remain in the remix, while all others are altered beyond recognition. The immediate production standout comes with \"Omega Supreme (DM Remix)\". Although lacking any new vocal treatments from Jemini, Danger Mouse flips the original song on its head by chopping 80s pianofunk with ridiculous timing, precisely layering in extra drums for variety, tossing in a twobar changeup near the end of the verses, and otherwise wholly reinventing one of Ghetto Pop Life's best cuts. It almost singularly makes up for other more disappointing moments over the course of the EP a good sign for any remix. Viewing the album from the lens of the more involved EP style, 26Inch fails to show any development from Jemini, and generally just allows Danger Mouse to experiment with different sounds. I'm hoping that Jemini takes to the topical variety he doled out on the group's preceding fulllength, and chills out on the singing when he unveils his upcoming Kill Your Heroes LP later this year. "}
