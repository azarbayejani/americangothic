{"label":" Moshi Moshi","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/16145/homepage_large.5c152712.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Douglas Wolk","artist":"Hercules and Love Affair","title":"Blue Songs","text":" Be warned, right off, that the Hercules and Love Affair on this album is not quite the same act as the group on 2008's Hercules and Love Affair. The band's songwriter, producer, and creative director, Andy Butler, remains in place, as does DJ/vocalist Kim Ann Foxman, but the others who lent their talents to the debut including singers Antony Hegarty and Nomi Ruiz, DFA producer Tim Goldsworthy, and !!! bassist Tyler Pope are replaced by a new team on a new label. Among the recruits are vocalists Aerea Negrot and Shaun Wright, and Bay Area producer Mark Pistel, whose previous credits include the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and industrial acts Meat Beat Manifesto and Consolidated. So be it; HLA was always a producer's group, and besides, Butler's taking a distinctly different tack on this album. Where Hercules and Love Affair built on the lush, rich sound of 1970s disco, Blue Songs is much more a house record specifically, house as it was understood around 1987, when Chicago sounded like the center of the musical universe. Its strongest tracks aim right at that target. \"My House\", in particular, is both a convincing pastiche of the heyday of Marshall Jefferson and Frankie Knuckles and a commentary on it from a remove of 20 years. (\"My house is in order,\" goes the hook; how did nobody manage to think of that pun at the time?) As the album rolls on, though, Butler fails to recapture the chemistry he had with previous vocalists. Negrot and Wright are not quite anonymous, but lack the dynamic presence of previous contributors. While it's interesting to hear how his style works in a pophouse context, Kele Okereke of Bloc Party's guest appearance on \"Step Up\" falls flat, and the song's chorus (\"Baby, you might just be like this/ Baby, this might be who you are\") is hardly juicy enough to bring the track to life on its own. Nearly every dance track here still has something to recommend, like the mockserious Grace Jones impression on \"Answers Come in Dreams\", or the swooping bass that introduces \"Falling\". \"Visitor\" distinctly recalls what Marshall Jefferson was doing when he went by the name Hercules on the 1986 single \"7 Ways\". But apart from \"My House\", nothing here feels like a complete package, and especially not the way \"Blind\", \"Athene\", \"You Belong\", and \"Hercules Theme\" did last time. Two slower songs in the middle of the album nearly derail it. \"Boy Blue\" has the incantatory, repetitious tone of house, but it's arranged around acoustic guitar and woodwinds and outstays its welcome considerably. It's followed by an earnest chilloutroom tune called \"Blue Song\", featuring Butler's own voice rather aggressively high in the mix. Butler has talked about wanting to demonstrate his \"ability to write more than a fourtothefloor dance track.\" The thing is, he's really good at writing fourtothefloor dance tracks, and the other stuff is nowhere near as interesting. Blue Songs closes with a meandering, beatless sixminute cover of another Jefferson production, Sterling Void's 1987 house single \"It's All Right\". That song was also covered, much more famously (and effectively), by Pet Shop Boys in 1989, which means that making it a part of this album album can't help but call up comparisons to the PSBs' version. (HLA also spell the song's title as \"It's Alright\", like the Boys.) Is Butler commenting on the relationship between house and pop music? Is he reclaiming house from some version of the mainstream? Is he just underscoring his own sources? It's hard to tell: So much of the album is straining to be more than just an homage to the club sounds of the late 80s that it ends up being a bit less. "}
