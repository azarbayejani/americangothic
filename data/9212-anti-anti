Led by singer/songwriter Jordan Jeffares, the Atlanta fourpiece mopes as cool as any number of Gotham brooders, and you don't need Interpol to know which way the gloom blows. There's even a round or two of throatrent Casablancas on the surprisingly romantic \"Stop Your Bleeding\", while \"Black Eyes\" leaves something uptown, as drummer Chandler Rentz pounds dark and pensive. True, if dudes were actually NYC men they'd be copping This Heat by now, but that, along with crisply efficient songcraft, is Snowden's secret. Their name may come from Joseph Heller's famously satirical Catch22, and their record may be called AntiAnti, but Snowden's fulllength debut is as flatout passionate as you used to expect from Jade Tree. The title track is the manifesto, unabashedly enjoying its catchy/dumb intro and guitar smolder in a way that pleasantly betrays its origins far from the potentially stultifying selfconsciousness of the only city that really matters, even as it bitterly mocks your \"fashion drugs\" and toocool silence. \"One time we believed, but now it's passing and clich√©,\" Jeffares' deep voice tells me, \"And she'll say anything to make you move again.\" Fuzzbasssmoked \"Between the Rent and Me\" cuts closer: \"What do you think I am/ Or do you think at all?\" The haunting chill that pervades such easeful deaths as \"My Murmuring Darling\", the armscrossed stomp that distances dancerock revival revivifications like \"Black Eyes\" they're just an enjoyable front, see, like Orr's stupidity in Catch22. Pretty soon guitars cry out for grease and Jeffares cries out for change and before proper cynicism can be mustered for a track called \"Kill the Power\" it turns out, shit, dude's been getting all political. When AntiAnti isn't calling a poseur a poseur, it's just as likely to call a bloodthirsty motherfucker a bloodthirsty motherfucker. Slow, harmonybloodied \"Victim Card\": \"We've been losing for quite some time now/ Across desert sands and across the land.\" Elsewhere, nervous headnodders could easily miss \"the only thing to fear,\" as told on TV in paranoid \"Counterfeit Rules\".  Everybody knows that bashing Bush and/or hipsters is the surest ways to boost page views, but AntiAnti isn't that obvious, and Snowden don't stop there. If the album's dour dance party eventually grows a tad monotonous, finale \"Sisters\" spells out a different direction, all squeaky frets, lofi hiss, and doubletracked falsetto, like Jeff Buckley fronting XOera Elliott Smith. \"So many ways to break a man/ And one is not to touch him at all,\" Jeffares moans. The original Snowden taught Yossarian that man is matter kill us and we're dead. It's OK for stylish postpunk to matter, too, and AntiAnti does so without forgetting to be fun.  "}
