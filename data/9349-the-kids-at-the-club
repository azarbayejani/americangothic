The 22 songs on this mailorder cassette are so widely venerated for propelling cute, jangly indie pop yes, twee to cult popularity that it might as well be true. Never mind that the tape included plenty of raucous and discordant bands, or that C81 was clearly better. It's far from surprising, but still twitterpating, then, that UK club night How Does It Feel to Be Loved? has chosen to release new indie pop comp The Kids at the Club. Like its precursor, or our collective impression of it, this CD06 (if you will) culls together a variety of sweet, bouncy, melodic, and dorky guitar pop, with a few moments of quiet genius easily offsetting some modest flaws. The aggressive wimpyness of C86 and progeny is the focus here, but their awkward primitivism remains mostly lost down the memory hole. I'm From Barcelona's \"We're From Barcelona\" is, of course, the opposite of \"lofi\" a skaspeckled ode to joy (and friendship), sung by a choir of love/hateable Swedes and it's among the giddiest indie pop delights in recent memory. Other highlights are nearly as polished, though some groups, like Swedish goofs Suburban Kids With Biblical Names, tend to dirty things back up a bit. Shimura Curves carefully apportion electropop, Jesus & Mary Chain fuzz, and bilingual romantic confusion on sparkly \"Noyfriend\", while fellow Londoners the Gresham Flyers toy with panning synth effects amid the boy/girl harmonies of \"Blackpool\". Elegant string arrangements and hushed Belle & Sebastian vocals on the Butcher Boy's \"Days Like These Will be the Death of Me\" lead into a bathdraining guitar outro straight from Blur's Modern Life Is Rubbish moper \"Resigned\". Indeed, another difference between The Kids at the Club and the indie pop canon is the very nostalgia entailed by such an endeavor. The Pastels, Talulah Gosh, and the Field Mice all had obvious influences, but true to pressrelease clich√©, they carved out identifiable sounds of their own; here even aboveaverage bands sometimes seem like worshipful echoes of yesterday's heroes more than exemplars of today's greatness. Austin's Voxtrot basically take the rhythm and vocal tics of the Smiths' \"This Charming Man\" and leave out everything that might be awkward during dorm room intimacy: \"Don't call me boring/ It's just 'cause I like you.\" Londonbased Lucky Soul jack much more than a beat from \"Be My Baby\", and their ebullient \"Give Me Love\" suffers for the comparison, while Language of Flowers' \"You're the One\" would be one of the few tracks here wispy enough for Sarah Records if it weren't just like the Cure's \"Just Like Heaven\". A true pop kid might not mind, but a critic wants more.  Nevertheless, The Kids at the Club is a fine introduction to current indie pop upandcomers, complete with detailed liner notes. Both longtime followers of the scene and curious newbies will all likely find their own tracks to love, from Swedish 60s obsessives Irene's Jens Lekmanesque \"Stardust\" to Manchesterbased Amida's \"Virtue Was Your Downfall\" with its Easybeats guitars, to synthled London group Fosca's neurotic rallying cry \"I've Agreed to Something I Shouldn't Have\". The beloved Amelia Fletcher, who fronted Talulah Gosh and Heavenly, even makes an appearance with her current group, Tender Trap, declaring independence amid the Pixieslike loudsoft of \"Ampersand\". The more indie pop changes, the more it \"Oh well,\" the Wedding Present sang to end the original C86, \"I hope you understand.\"  "}
