{"label":" Quarterstick","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/10375/homepage_large.d6e34962.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Klein","artist":"Mekons","title":"Natural","text":"  A couple of years ago, Wired magazine tapped Jeff Tweedy to curate a night of their \"Next Fest\", the idea being that the Wilco frontman would select some innovative act as the future of music. Ever the pragmatist, Tweedy picked Joanna Newsom, not for aesthetic reasons but practical ones: in the future, he surmised, we'll all be living in a postapocalyptic world without electricity, so he wisely selected a singer who can go without. From the start, the Mekons have been making postapocalyptic music, albeit of the wry and electric sort. But Natural, the latest in the group's long line of records, is, per Tweedy's dictum, truly postapocalyptic folk, music for when the lights go out and hope burns only dimly. It's the Mekons unlikely \"unplugged\" bid. Of course, like most unplugged sets, it's really nothing of the sort, and as folk it won't exactly have the purist set nodding in approval. In fact, Natural, is only folk in the sense that the Mekons were ever truly punk, at least in the standard parlance. Indeed, the semilegendary Leeds group is about as punk as any act that would cheekily title a record Punk Rock. Which is to say, for most of their 30 years, the group has been just as closely associated with the communal aspects of folk as they have been with any other style of music, punk included. The Mekons shifted idioms to fit their shifting tastes, but they never abandoning the earnest ideals and outrage that fueled the band through decades of Margaret Thatcher, miner strikes and major label snafus.  So, folk, reggae, punk, whatever: Natural is first and foremost Mekons disc, of a thematic piece with 2000's mournful Journey to the End of the Night, and as such it's important to take note of what the band is saying as much as how they're saying it. \"The twisted trees sing,\" go the opening lines of \"Dark, Dark Dark\". \"The trees stare back/ And we burn in smoke/ Reflecting in the water like ghosts/ Drifting this way and that.\" This is Thoreau's nightmare, transcendentalism flipped on its side, the forces of nature recoiling at the sight of man's folly and fighting back, then sifting through the wreckage of civilization.  Or so we might surmise. Thoreau gets a shout out in \"Cockermouth\", and the rest of the album is filled with imagery both environmental and elemental, with an emphasis on blood and fire. \"Cockermouth\" introduces the not very bucolic observation of \"jet fighters swooping loud and low\" but the song may be a wasteland flashback driven by an echoing mantra of defeat: \"You'd don't have to believe in the end/ You have to believe this is the end.\"  A few months back, speaking in his Chicago studio, Langford declared his love of classic UK folk, and revealed how much of Natural was written and composed in a room of a hired house. That might explain why so much of the album sounds like what might come of a band of survivors convening after the end of the world, setting their stories to music to be passed on to future generations. The instrumentation is largely spare, the lyrics showcasing little of the rage or sardonic humor for which the band is known. Rather, this is pretty relentlessly bleak stuff, and even the pagan poetry of \"White Stone Door\" is played straight: \"Dance the toes right off your feet/ Making up the story as you go,\" sings Sally Timms. \"The dancers are all dead we know/ Behind the white stone door.\"  The shuffling \"Give Us Wine or Money\" features an agrarian scenario played not as Communist utopia but as cutthroat reality where \"on the earth where blood is spilt/ The few must feed the many.\" The incredible \"Diamonds\", with its trademark collective vocals, likens the potential to do right in the world to unpolished gems, but success is still tempered by death, with salmon lost at sea miraculously finding their way back to fresh water and \"the inevitable slaughter.\" Even the more rollicking country blues of \"Shocking Curse Bird\" features the central metaphor nesting \"in Goya's nightmare.\"  On 2002's rousing OOOH! the Mekons were pissed and fighting back. Here the battle is already lost, the band resigned and, all options exercised, waiting for what comes next. The power's out. The lights are off. Natural is the end of the world as cautionary campfire tale, the Mekons akin to T.S. Eliot's dejected hollow men (whose world ended \"not with a bang but with a whimper\"), waiting for the sun to rise and wishing the new day will reveal the path forward.  "}
