Deusner","artist":"Gram Parsons","title":"The Reprise Sessions","text":"  I'll start with the obvious reissue questions. First, regarding availability, Gram Parsons' two solo albums, GP (1972) and Grievous Angel (1973), have long been combined on one CD for less than half the price of this 3xCD set. Nevertheless, the upgrade is worthwhile: The songs have been remastered for this reissue, and the packaging is greatly improved, with miniature cardboard LP sleeves for the discs and new liners by Holly GeorgeWarren and Parke Puterbaugh although the latter's interpretation of \"Return of the Grievous Angel\" seems questionable. Regarding bonus material, The Complete Reprise Sessions includes a wealth of extra tracks, including alternate takes and demos as well as a radio spot advertising GP and several interviews with Parsons. On the one hand, these interviews are excellent complements to the music: hearing him speak, despite his stoned cadence, is much more revealing than reading transcripts in the liners. But for some reason, the producers Emmylou Harris and John Austin have placed some of these bonus tracks at the end of the two proper albums, where they completely disrupt the flow of the songs and the finality of the records. Grievous Angel ought to fade into meaningful silence after \"In My Hour of Darkness\", as handsome a eulogy as anyone ever wrote for himself. Instead, that short silence is interrupted by an instrumental version of \"Return of the Grievous Angel\", which sounds like a karaoke track, followed by an interview clip. The position of the bonus material is a legitimate complaint, but its bearing on the music ultimately is minimal. It's doubtful that even the most harebrained sequencing could ruin these songs. Drenched in pedal steel, GP reveals its demons gradually, especially on Parsons originals like \"Still Feeling Blue\" and the elegiac \"A Song for You\", which exhibit a mastery of melody that few other country rockers can approach. \"Kiss the Children\" and \"How Much I've Lied\" are brokenfamily songs that couldn't sound any more convincing out of George Jones' mouth. As he often did, Parsons romanticizes the country life on songs like \"She\" and \"Streets of Baltimore\", but it's touching rather than overly sentimental. He comes across as a confused kid looking for answers in country music's clearcut morals, in its absolute distinctions between sin and virtue. Biographically and psychologically, country music may have been a substitute for Parsons' own tragic family life. As a result, GP sounds like a heartfelt album that truly fears damnation but locates a precarious redemption in every note.Grievous Angel might actually be better. That title could be Parsons' CB handle, and the album has the picaresque pace of a travelogue, from the trucker's lament of \"Return of the Grievous Angel\" to the godspeed prayer of \"In My Hour of Darkness\". In this context the fake \"live\" medley of the Louvin Brothers' \"Cash on the Barrelhead\" and the Byrds' \"Hickory Wind\" (which Parsons cowrote) makes perfect sense. By that point, his life was mostly tours and travel, and this transience is reflected in the unsettled lyrics. He dives into autobiography on \"Brass Buttons\", which Puterbaugh asserts is about Parsons' alcoholic mother, and \"$1000 Wedding\", about an actual event in his life. \"Love Hurts\" is a superlative duet with Harris, their voices melding sensuously and dramatically, and \"In My Hour of Darkness\" drives a big rig off into the sunset, with Parsons lamenting the deaths of three friends and asking the lord for safety and wisdom. Parsons might just as well be singing about himself on that song. He died of a drug overdose before Grievous Angel was released, so \"In My Hour of Darkness\" was his final bow. Given all the impenetrable myths that have built up around him, it seems important to emphasize this song as a finale, which is why the tackedon bonus tracks hurt so much. They would have been less intrusive on the third disc, which is comprised solely of newly unearthed outtakes and a few rare tracks from the 1976 compilation Sleepless Nights. This disc has no flow to interrupt and no cohesion to break, but that doesn't mean these songs aren't worthwhile. In addition to rougher versions of \"Return of the Grievous Angel\" and \"We'll Sweep Out the Ashes in the Morning\" and revvedup takes on \"Ooh Las Vegas\" and \"I Can't Dance\", Parsons and the band inject a little boogie into the last bars of \"She\" and \"Still Feeling Blue\", without losing any of their gravity. And Parsons' cover of the Louvin Brothers' \"The Angels Rejoiced Last Night\", in addition to seeming semiautobiographical, would have been perfectly at home on Grievous Angel.  These are ostensibly the last Parsons gems left to unearth. Maybe there are more, but it seems unlikely at least of this high quality. So maybe it's best that there are a few flaws in The Complete Reprise Sessions. The placement of these interviews will have to be remedied on another set, and revisiting these songs in the future will certainly be something to look forward to.  "}
