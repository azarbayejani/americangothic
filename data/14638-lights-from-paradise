(Never mind the fact that its most prominent mouthpieces Kyuss' John Garcia, Monster Magnet's Dave Wyndorf sounded like they'd rather start a bar brawl than smoke a bowl.) Upon their 2007 formation, Toronto's Quest for Fire were quickly stamped with the stonerrock tag, no thanks to their longstanding association with Black Mountain (QFF singer/guitarist Chad Ross was once their roadie) and their signing to Tee Pee Records, a longtime facilitator of fellow wahwahpedal abusers. But compared to the muscular, magmathick riffage that has come to define the genre, Quest for Fire's sophomore release, Lights From Paradise, is less stoner rock than stoned rock, marked by a patient pace and a foggyheaded whimsy that lingers even as the VU levels surge into the red.The members of Quest for Fire all have roots in loud, raucous rock bands (most notably Ross and guitarist Andrew Gunn in the Deadly Snakes and drummer Mike Maxymuik in metalcore thrashers Cursed), but more so than their 2009 selftitled debut, Lights From Paradise posits Quest for Fire as an outlet through which they can explore more sonically expansive, texturally rich modes of composition. Where the band introduced themselves on their debut with the strobelit psychpunk stomp \"Bison Eyes\", Lights From Paradise immediately distinguishes itself with the slowpercolating, sevenminute \"The Greatest Hits By God\", which leavens its caveman rumble with foreboding violin swells (courtesy of Godspeed veteran Sophie Trudeau) in a manner that suggests Spacemen 3 by way of Constellation Records. The longer tracks on the album (\"Confusion's Home\", \"Sessions of Light\") exhibit a similar restraint they may get progressively louder and more intense over their extended durations, but they never accelerate or derail; their intent is to envelop rather than overpower.It's thus fitting that Quest for Fire's definitive quality is also their least pronounced: Ross' drowsy David Gilmourian drawl, which never rises above a breathy sigh. While that means his voice is sometimes overwhelmed by the sounds swirling around him particularly when QFF revert back to acidrock rager mode on \"Set Out Alone\" and \"In the Place of a Storm\" it also makes him an effective harbinger of calmbeforethestorm unease; even the disquieting buildup of \"Hinterland Who's Who\" provides scant preparation for the monstrous, fuzzmetal attack unleashed in its closing stretch. So as it turns out, Quest for Fire are actually a stonerrock band in the truest sense of the term one that understands every buzz is fleeting, and that the most blissful high is inevitably answered by the cruelest of comedowns.
