The record itself was a winner too an unforgiving, tinfoiltoned broken blues howl and only the latest addictive salve for followers of head Whip and Pink & Brown veteran John Dwyer. Peanut Butter and Jelly Live at the Ginger Minge is another goddamn home run, a reminder to bad livers and unshowered dancers everywhere that looking's free, but touching's gonna cost you something. It's not really live that's a joke. (Go ahead, try and find \"The Ginger Minge\" in a club listing.) But the record crackles with the flinty immediacy of a Coachwhips live show, where the trio sets up on the venue's floor and launches into a condensed marathon of feedback and foot stomp heroics. On Peanut Butter, Dwyer's consumptive wheeze and chaotic electric guitar spew lead his drums and keys accompaniment through 10 tracks in 20 minutes. Organist (well, Casio player) ValTronic and drum set attendant Matt Hartman have more to offer than their instrumental counterparts did on Bangers. Openers \"Body and Brains\" and \"I Made a Bomb\" establish Hartman's drumming as more than a flailing, pounding mess there's a discernable blues rhythm amidst the noise, and Tronic's keys tinge the ends of the notes like a headache in search of Excedrin. Now, Coachwhips aren't trying out for Fat Possum's stable of new traditionalists. They're just obsessed with creating an Xrated boogie machine (\"Did You Cum?\", one song title asks), and patching into Hasil Adkins' amp provides more than enough stamina for the operation. There's blister pack noise (\"Human Skin\"), death ray reverb (\"I Made a Bomb\" again), and even the occasional chord progression of more than two notes (\"PB + J\"). ValTronic steps up again for \"Letter 2 London\", where her organ plays off the rhythmic crash of Dwyer's guitar for a sound that fires wildly from a dark Memphis alley. Dwyer still stands at the center of the Coachwhips fever party. Though the occasional song title or \"I wanna!\" exclamation bleeds through the hiss, for the most part his vocals are a slot above functional jibberish. And this is perfect for Ginger Minge, since comprehension would cause the brain to consider the rest of this tingling, piking, base pleasure mess. "}
