Deusner","artist":"Herman Dune","title":"1-2-3/Apple Tree EP","text":" In the United States, 2008 was a banner year for Herman Dune, the FrancoSwedish sibling duo of DavidIvar Herman Düne (the one with the beard) and Néman Herman Dune (the other one). Following the almost viral success of their video for \"I Wish That I Could See You Soon\", the band toured the States, played some festivals, and lined up three domestic releases: two EPs, I Wish That I Could See You Soon and 123/Apple Tree, and one fulllength, Next Year in Zion. On each, the duo get by on naïve charm, affecting wonder and innocence even in the face of great tragedy, which gives DavidIvar's wordy lyrics and talky vocals an undercurrent real melancholy and which makes Herman Dune sound more substantial than most artists in the socalled antifolk scene.Like the I Wish That I could See You Soon EP, 123/Apple Tree corrals a few Bsides behind a catchy, starryeyed single. The title track is disarmingly simple in its construction (numerous verses, no chorus), but makes the most of juxtaposing flutes and guitars against DavidIvar's genial wordplay. The unassuming openness he's trying to communicate in the song comes through in the music, and the four songs that follow tease out similar ideas about affection and need. Despite the Kimya Dawson shoutout, the minorkey \"Your Name My Game\" sound apocalyptic by comparison to the upbeat title track, placing a tense guitar solo against DavidIvar's description of crows and deer acting out his own romantic angst. \"Song for Golda\", about his beloved dog, is a tender antidote for anyone who was dragged to Marley & Me, while \"Song of Samuel\", about a Jewish violin teacher in love with his pupil, sounds at first like a fable, but turns out to have the gravity of an old family story passed down through generations. Even its happy ending sounds earned.On 123/Apple Tree, Herman Dune seem determined to show their every facet and prove what all they can do with their limited setup. Unfortunately, Next Year in Zion doesn't follow up on that. Perhaps because there is no obvious single to anchor the release (with its gentle horns and heraldic guitars, opener \"On a Saturday\" comes close), everything here sounds like a Bside. \"Try to Think About Me (Don't You Worry a Bit)\" and the slightly condescending \"Baby Is Afraid of Sharks\" both stumble on snoozy verses and only perk up on their very short choruses, and \"An Afternoon Dance Party\" and \"Lovers Are Waterproof\" get tangled up in their dense storylines. Herman Dune's particular charms aren't altogether missing from Next Year in Zion. On \"When the Sun Rose Up This Morning\", DavidIvar forgets a neglectful parent when a lover smiles at him; simple pleasures, he implies, can compensate for life's massive tragedies. Elsewhere, he gets a lot of mileage out of clever rhymes and oddball phrasing. On the title track, he manages to match \"Zion\" with \"fight like a giant,\" \"made of iron,\" and most memorably \"There are healthier things that I now get high on.\" In general, though, the album sounds muted and lagging, emphasizing hazy melancholy over specific joy. We know Herman Dune can find a better balance. "}
