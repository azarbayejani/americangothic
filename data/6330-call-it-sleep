{"label":" Hush","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/6238/homepage_large.0832189c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Dahlen","artist":"The Places","title":"Call It Sleep","text":" Last time around, The Places set their sights on comets and quasars. Singer/songwriter Amy Annelle tapped a who's who of Portland, Oregon to record The Autopilot Knows You Best, a minor masterpiece of indie pop where folky violin and accordions complemented the crazyscientist sounds of shortwave static and lost voices. Melodic indie pop brushed against swaying acoustic ballads, and although her low, murmuring voice gave it a dreamy coherence, Autopilot was also an exciting patchwork: Each track made a new discovery. The followup, finished in 2002 but not released until this month, couldn't be more different. On Call It Sleep, exhaustion hangs from Annelle's voice like dust in her hair. Each ballad sounds weary to the bone, not from melancholy or a nameable heartache, but like builtup fatigue: Annelle has flopped on your couch after ten hours of crossing dry, identical landscapes, and you can't tell if she wants to talk about it. The album runs more slowly and evenly than Autopilot, as lazy guitars scraggle over the shuffling of drums and upright bass, but the focus lies with Annelle and the nuances in her vocals. She sings in a low voice whose undertones resonate like blowing on the neck of a beer bottle. Intimate and unforced, she comes close to vanishing before your eyes: Witness how ethereally she blends into the radio static on \"Program Ten\". And by singing quietly, she compels, especially when she pipes up or lets the notes swell and coast, as on \"Ruined New Life\". At its best, Call It Sleep has gorgeous melodies and a clear sense for atmosphere, never overplaying its fragility or stifling the mood. She refrains from big moments, except on the album's more propulsive finish, \"'Til the Death\" but more typical are the sways from troubled to resolute, the shift from \"Travel Light\"'s desolation to the steady outdoor cantina waltz of \"Clean Starts\". But it's also a less remarkable album than its predecessor, despite its own round of guest stars. Members of The Decemberists, The Swords Project, and Death Cab for Cutie, but nobody steals the spotlight: The extra instrumentation they provide is subtle, from the treadingonglass vibes to the halfdrowned piano on the achingly delicate \"Dead Reckoning\". Additionally, fans of Autopilot might miss the quirky variety and \"geek chic\" of its experimentation and science references; on her cover of The Dreamies' \"Program Ten\", Annelle takes some playtime with shortwaves and sampling, but it's not as ebullient as the last album's cover of Syd Barrett's \"Late Night\". The tone is heavy, and the decision to sequence the slowest songs (\"What I Wouldn't Do for You\", \"Travel Light\") in succession almost stops the album. Where The Places' last LP served as a pop complement to Annelle's quieter solo outings, Call It Sleep doesn't spark new ideas so much as shore up her work as a singer and songwriter. Ultimately, Call It Sleep works as a transition album in her career, and also in the content of her lyrics. Even at its quietest, the record isn't sad so much as pensive: The ballads' reserve and the song titles like \"Clean Starts\", \"Travel Light\", or \"Ruined New Life\" evoke a sense of Annelle changing gears and deciding where to head next. She doesn't conjure as many possibilities as before, but she hones in on the choices that count. "}
