This is not what's supposed to happen to these guys. After their label, Arista, messily merged with J Records, the duo was shuffled to Jive/Zomba, an imprint historically unable to market gritty hiphop. For a brief moment, the Brothers Thornton sat idly, intermittently whining about their stillforthcoming album Hell Hath No Fury, and plotting their return. But lacking the backing of den mother Pharrell Williams, who launched their careers with \"Grindin'\" and produced their entire debut with partner Chad Hugo, Clipse were toast. So, of course, in an attempt to stonewall Jive into voiding their contract, they recorded the year's most astonishing mixtape series, We Got It 4 Cheap. And when forced to pick up the pieces and carry on, talkin' and sellin' shit, Malice and Pusha recruited two baritone toughs from Philly, AbLiva and Sandman, to round out their new incarnation.The result is the ReUp Gang, a supergroup in the most undistinguished sense. AbLiva and Sandman are the stylistic opposite of Clipse, burly in voice and muddy in inflection, intensifying most tracks, but usually just acting as foils. All vocals are mixed way upfront by DJ/entrepreneur Clinton Sparks, easier to hear over instrumentals you already know. Subtle choices like these make We Got It 4 Cheap's two volumes and chiefly Volume 2 the best examples of what a mixtape can be. Bigger than just that new shit you cop from Canal St., these demonstrate that mixtapes, like albums, can be an art form. Mixing, scratching, beat choice, reconfiguring choruses all come into play, elevating typical songwriting into philosophical, deconstructionist terms. \"How can I make this better?\" \"This beat would sound hotter if we rapped on it,\" etc.Have we talked drugs yet? That's what they do here; talk the art of the deal and their mastery of such. It sounds simplistic, but Clipse have been the premier drugdealing soliloquists for some time. Unflinching and unforgiving, ReUp reimagine hustler as hero with lyrical ingenuity and deft wordplay. Some may struggle with the joy these boys get from moving weight; it's an indefensible stance we all have our faults, and we all have to eat but the revelry is also what makes it enjoyable. Otherwise, Clipse could just move West and write for scripts for Michael Mann.Volume 1, which hit back in January, is too long, and it's overrun with suspect beat selection and too many references to HBO's \"The Wire\". It's antipopulist and too short on the MCs in demand, Malice and Pusha, who appear on about half the songs. But it's also far stronger than most releases like it, featuring a reinvigorated crew and one killer freestyle (\"Coast to Coast\"). Tracks like \"Studin' Y'all\" and \"Pussy (Remix)\" made them seem relevant again, too. A few months later, \"Zen\" fell from the sky (onto their website) and the divide was drawn. Once a tremendously gifted but onedimensional singles crew, Clipse took their talents to new heights with the abrasively dynamic song. Teeming with quotables (\"I sell that ostrich, I'm so obnoxious\"; \"Two diamond jump rope, my neck do the double dutch\"; \"All I see blackface and you singin' 'Mammy'\"), Clipse were possessed by a new vigor. They were clever before, sure, but now everyone especially the contemptuously nasal Pusha had become transcendent.Volume 2 delivers on the promise of \"Zen\". In alternating mismanaged heaters (\"So Seductive\", the murderous \"Kobra\"), hugely successful singles (\"1 Thing\", \"Hate It or Love It\"), and timeless thrillers (\"Elevators\", \"Daytona 500\"), the pacing never slows. It would be too easy to list punchline after punchline, but to put it simply, Pusha, whose scintillating word choice and deft phrasing can be frightening, takes Timbaland's \"Put You on the Game\" and makes it his anthem on \"What's Up\". His verse barks and prances at once: \"Cop the sorbet/ Straight from Jorge/ Jack of all trades/ Even mastered the gourmet/ Plus the price got the street tongue in cheek/ Cook it till it's Al Dente/ Muah, magnifique!\"The second volume also features key contributions from Pharrell who's still rapping (mostly awkwardly) but is apparently writing his own lyrics, according to Pusha on a humorously assertive interlude. Skateboard P's flow is jumbled but his sentiments are personal on \"Maybe (Remix)\" where he reveals insecurities about uncleared samples over the \"Elevators\" beat (\"You and me/ BAPE, Ice Cream, and BBC\"). Finally, some vulnerability.The tape ends on a tranquil note with \"Ultimate Flow\". Lifting the strummy, nearly forgotten instrumental from Lil' Kim's \"Drugs\", Pusha offers a summation of the conquest: \"I draw this off inspiration, you trace shit.\" Things still aren't right with the world (\"Nigga, fuck Zomba/ I sell nose candy.../ Willy Wonka\"). And the future of Hell Hath No Fury is still unknown. Some joker at Amazon.com even set the release date for January 1, 2020. Perhaps someone at Jive should take notice a lot of people still care about these rogues. "}
