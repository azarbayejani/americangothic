It was one of many elements that defined him in the beginning, on his band's hugely popular 1994 selftitled debut (The Blue Album), if one of few remaining characteristics defining his music today.Following poor initial sales of the record's followup, the more introspective cult hit Pinkerton, Cuomo famously retreated from the public eye. Over the next five years, the band would remain silent, cultivating goodwill and an evergrowing army of fans. But most of that goodwill has deteriorated since their reemergence in 2001, in the wake of three mediocretoawful albums that were, in many ways, the opposite of what made Cuomo's band so adored in the first place.Sadly, the once burnedout Weezer continue to fade away: Those first two records capture their decade in 75 minutes of nearperfect powerpop: straightfaced irony, eccentric sincerity, meta references, and bipolar guitar distortion from ordinarylooking outcasts who became stars and then complained about it. Punk that's too catchy to offend. Pop that's too smart to cop to itself. And, uh, emo. After Pinkerton, the deluge; rapmetal and postgrunge wound up so thoroughly conquering modern rock that now even staunch rockists are making excited noises about \"American Idol\" winner David Cook. Hey, somebody's supposed to save mainstream rock'n'roll, right?Not these guys. Beginning with 2001's soso Green Album and plumbing Jules Verne depths with 2005's terrible Make Believe, the band began to take on some of the most infuriating characteristics of the very bands that had replaced them during their absence: intelligenceinsulting songwriting, cookiecutter dynamics, questionable facial hair. At the very least, The Red Album (as Weezer have nicknamed their latest) is a first step toward rehabilitation a tacit admission that recent discs, with their empty universality and recycled riffs, had a problem. But it's not a return to glory unless you consider 2001 their glory days.Judging by appetizing first single \"Pork and Beans\", The Red Album could've been almost as funny and catchy as Pinkerton's \"El Scorcho\", only from the perspective of a married man coming up on 40. It's as if last year's demos compilation, Alone, helped Cuomo remember how to do this stuff right. His sarcastic mention of superproducer Timbaland's chart magic is as hilarious as it is onpoint especially after Madonna's dreadful, Timhelmed #1 single, \"4 Minutes\". Jacknife Lee (who coproduced the album along with Make Believe overseer Rick Rubin) lets the chorus explode from the mix in a way that little on the radio does anymore. It demands to be sung by millions of uncomprehending bargoers.With an opening Rogaine reference, \"Pork and Beans\" also establishes The Red Album's main theme. Already a selfdescribed \"old man\" on Pinkerton, Cuomo is focused these days on reliving his lost youth probably the same reason some of us still listen to Weezer albums. Lead track and third single \"Troublemaker\" starts back in school, a faint whiff of existential angst and a surging bridge helping to redeem a vapid chorus and monotonous, familiarsounding guitars. The laughably bad \"Heart Songs\" is The Blue Album's nostalgic \"In the Garage\" schmaltzed up as a sort of namedropping \"Circle of Life\"; if Nirvana had \"the chords that broke the chains I had upon me,\" kudos to Cuomo for swiping them on the otherwise forgettable teenage prankfest \"Everybody Get Dangerous\" (to quote: \"booyahhh\").At this point, Weezer is as much a brand as a band. When Cuomo relinquishes the mic, The Red Album could be by any group of modernrock mediocrities. Longtime guitarist Brian Bell gets throaty and twangy like a poor man's Rob Thomas on repetitive nonapology \"Thought I Knew\", backed by bland acoustic guitar and a TR808 drum machine. Bassist Scott Shriner speaksings in creepy stalker mode on \"Cold Dark World\", with Cuomo swooping to the rescue on the choruses. \"Automatic\", led by original drummer Pat Wilson, returns to the faceless crunching of 2002's Maladroit.Not that Cuomo needs other voices to reveal that The Red Album is hardly the work of idiosyncratic auteurship the first couple of singles could've suggested. He sings on peppy, temposwitching \"Dreamin'\" and the grandiose finale, \"The Angel and the One\", but for all their backgroundfriendly polish, both are typical, vacuous latterday Weezer tracks.The Red Album's most ambitious song adapts the Shaker hymn \"Simple Gifts\". The melody, played first on piano recalling Pinkerton's \"Across the Sea\", is more obvious than the Erik Satie snippet Cuomo ganked for The Blue Album's \"Surf Wax America\", but now, as then, the theft isn't the point. \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\" is the warped genius let loose, from halfrapped intro to Queen bombast to baroque a cappella. Like the YouTube culture the \"Pork and Beans\" video depicts so well, the song and this album relies on a high quantity of shortlived pretty good ideas to distract from a shortage of great ones. "}
