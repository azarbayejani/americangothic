{"label":" Rough Trade","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/15875/homepage_large.ced9fdee.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ryan Dombal","artist":"Warpaint","title":"The Fool","text":" When singerguitarists Emily Kokal and Theresa Wayman sing, \"now I've got you in the undertow,\" on Warpaint's debut LP, the line comes off like a threat. It's not dramatic, though. The words come out serenely perhaps too serenely. \"What's the matter?/ You hurt yourself?/ Open your eyes and there was someone else,\" they coo dreamily, shapeshifting underneath a fine mist of guitars and bass. True to its name, \"Undertow\" sinks in without hurry. Its ambient horror is in the realm of Rosemary's Baby or Heavenly Creatures or the first half of The Shining. Their thrills are far from cheap. And the same sense of ghostliness runs throughout The Fool, a ninesong seance of an album that's as subtle as it is disquieting.In these days of solitary laptop acts and quickfizzle popup bands, Warpaint's freefloating sound is largely dependent on the uncanny bond between principals and longtime friends Kokal, Wayman, and bassist Jenny Lee Lindberg. Live, each one is in her own zone, often with eyes shut and head loose. It's almost like watching them make up songs in realtime at every show, the tangling highs and darting lows frothing to a natural climax only to dissipate just as easily. Their chemistry is inexplicable and fascinating to behold. With Kokal and Wayman often singing on either side of a central Lindberg who commands attention with her spacedout sway the live attack is engrossing. Together with drummer Stella Mozgawa, Warpaint speak a sultry, desertrock language that no one else is privy to, but you can't help but want to crack it nonetheless.And while The Fool doesn't fully capture their brainmelded performances, it's a worthy simulacrum. The songs on which Kokal takes lead duties tend to be a bit more sinister (when she sings, \"Don't you call anybody else baby cause I'm your baby still\" on spare ballad \"Baby\", the 10milestare delivery is spooky), while Wayman's verses are more vulnerable. Offkilter highlight \"Shadows\" has Wayman stumbling through tinted sidewalks: \"I know I'm afraid/ I'm drunk and I'm tired/ And the city I walk in feels like it swallows.\" The song's unique, snarebased beat and lonely string plucks aptly recreate her confusion. Elsewhere, flashes of Stevie Nicks (at her most diffuse) and Jeff Buckley (at his most daydreamy) meander through. And while sonic comparisons to early Cat Power have been abundant, Warpaint's live prowess and bandoriented sound offer distinct differences, too.In the middle of \"Baby\", a small bit of George Harrison's White Album favorite \"Long, Long, Long\" sneaks in. \"How I love you,\" sings Kokal, and then the nod is dropped just as quickly. The group pulled a similar trick on \"Billie Holiday\", from their Exquisite Corpse EP, on which they worked some of \"My Guy\" into the track's fabric. Like the effortlessness that surrounds Warpaint, both references feel totally instinctive; it's as if they just happened upon them, took what they needed, and moved on. "}
