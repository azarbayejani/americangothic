{"label":" Nettwerk","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/11317/homepage_large.d92b63ee.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Ladytron","title":"Velocifero","text":"  Not only was Witching Hour one of the better albums of 2005, it more or less saved Ladytron's career. For a group that sprang up right on time for the whole earlyaughts electroclash morass to subsume them, the group's transformation to a subtly more melodic, popfriendly, and emotionally expressive style made a lot of sense, both in terms of stylistic evolution and just plain old selfpreservation. It's the same instinct that kept New Order and Depeche Mode going long after people stopped using the term \"new wave\" in earnest and even if there was still plenty of runwaywalk detachment in their sound, the music made it feel perfectly human. But there's another human impulse that keeps the followup Velocifero from hitting quite as hard, and that's the desire to stick with what works, especially if that formula took you to another level. There's not much wrong with that method where this album's concerned; substituting refinement and subtle expansion for constant evolution isn't that heinous a crime, and being big on Witching Hour will probably lead you to appreciate Velocifero in a more reserved way. There's no pinnedtoyourseat blowaways like \"Destroy Everything You Touch\" or \"High Rise\", a shortage of legitimately affecting ballads in the vein of \"All the Way...\" or \"Beauty*2\", and a severe dearth of the subtle levity that made Witching Hour an expansive record in other words, there's really not a lot of immediacy to Velocifero at all. What this record does have is a solid number of gothpop hookfests. Compared to the highlights of their previous records, the songs on Velocifero have more movement than actual force; the shuffleglam \"Ghosts\" gets surprisingly little bassrange impact from such a heavy stomp, and the rapid synthpop pulses on \"I'm Not Scared\" and \"Season of Illusions\" threaten to slip from a groove to a rut if you think of them strictly in terms of rhythm. (For a record with some input from Ed Banger electropop remix specialists Vicarious Bliss, that's kind of hard to imagine.)  But the vocals make up for that, and aside from the occasional lyrical clunker (from \"Versus\": \"like a kitten versus rain\" d'aww, sniffle), it's impressive how Helen Marnie and Mira Aroyo take emptyonpaper lyrics and give them meaning through sheer repetition. We've already heard more than enough about little runaways from Del Shannon (and, uh, Bon Jovi), but Marnie's singing in \"Runaway\" sweetly offsets the harsh snarl of Velocifero's hardesthitting instrumental backing and turns a pop clich√© (\"Where you waking up today/ My little runaway\") into a haunting refrain. The aforementioned \"Ghosts\" works because its enigmatic hook \"There's a ghost in me/ Who wants to say I'm sorry/ Doesn't mean I'm sorry\" is delivered with Marnie's noteperfect singsong delivery, a simultaneously taunting and regretful voice which not only gives the words gravity but lends a good amount of weight to an otherwise flatsounding song. And Mira Aroyo, relatively scarce on Witching Hour, has more opportunities to showcase her icy, sharp, oftenforeboding voice, singing in her native Bulgarian with a sinister deadpan on \"Black Cat\" and a sleek, mellifluous energy on traditional folk song \"Kletva\"; in English her raspy purr turns the circa1990 technopop of \"Deep Blue\" into a seething comeon.  Writers and fans like to talk about how wintry and cold Ladytron's music is, which might be the album's real shortcoming; maybe it'll sound a bit more appropriate five or six months after its June release when its isolated iciness has a suitable environmental backdrop. But even with a somewhat diminished speakerfilling capability and a couple of songs that seem to have less actual energy than they should, Velocifero's subtlety will eventually reward further listens. Not everything has to be an exclamation point or a CGI explosion, and even if Ladytron excel in big, instantgrab attentiongetting pop maneuvers, the dearth of them here only means that they've got a good venue to prove they can get by OK on restraint.
