Prologue: Lou Reed, sailor suit/cap, walks the plank of \"Heroin\"'s \"great big clipper ship.\" That's a backward glancing start, but the bulk of the chapters will involve a Deep Listening of Slint, June of 44, Pinback, et al. providing ample proof that these landlubbers don't really know how to drop anchor or tie knots, but for some reason really dig The Odyssey. More esoterically, analyzing sine waves of noise trio Nautical Almanac's buzz offers evidence that freakfolk beards were inspired as much by Herman Melville as Devendra Banhart. Epilogue: Colin Meloy, eyepatch/life preserver/seabreeze facial cleaner, on Dickens' representation of shipyards. Currituck Co. aka Kevin Barker aka a fine banjo, acoustic, and electric guitar player but somewhat sketchy songwriter has added a footnote to this potential book with Ghost Man on Second, a 2xCD journey more or less reenacting a \"fabled\" boat trip. Following last year's often engrossing sets of bastardized standards Ghost Man On First, it's the weaker part deux in a series of three meditations on \"trees, families, nautical exploration, and John Fahey's body.\" The sea thing isn't overt: More obvious is the indebtedness to Fahey. And because a goodly journey deserves a return, there's a pairingoff of songs across disc one (\"In Two Towards\") and disc two (\"In Turn Returns\"): \"Embark\" vs. \"Disembark,\" etc. Besides conceptual ballast, improvisation provides the record's key methodology. Inspired by the blazing folkraga and jazz drum pairings of renowned guitarist Sandy Bull and Billy Higgins, Barker's joined by Espers' Otto Hauser on the pitterpat skins. Thus far Barker's done his best work by his lonesome: Hauser's a tentative player and seems to throw off Barker's timing. The drumming is also oddly mixed, sounding as if KB's standing on deck with Hauser locked in the ship's bowels. I get the polyphonic effect they're attempting, but it doesn't work. On various levels, Ghost Man on Second is in need of an edit. Thirtyminute excursions like \"Space Cruisin' Boogie (Remix)\" are admirably epic, but you really do need to earn a sitcomlength track. Nod here to Henry Flynt. And again for Sunburned Hand of the Man. Oh, and Supreme Dicks, please. A second disctwo ramble, \"Don't the C Look Wide and Deep\", finds Barker and Hauser losing synch: drums slip here and there, guitars lose track of themselves. Besides \"Disembark\"'s intriguing banjo and Turkish drum dual, disc two's dead weight. It's a surprisingly sloppy and plodding set. (For a more inspired take, Ben Chasny and Chris Corsano kick up a maelstrom on Six Organs of Admittance's School of the Flower.) The stronger moments are on disc one. The launch of \"Embark\" could be Jewelled Antler playing a drum set's hardware. And \"My Home\" is an upbeat acoustic piece with vocals. Admittedly, Barker sometimes sounds like Kermit the Frog, but his sentiments about eschewing the Top 40 (\"back 40 be my home...\") are sort of funny, or at least honest. On sister song, \"Where Is My Friend?\", the \"It's Not Easy Being Green\" melody is even a bit noticeable. Barker also just released Sleepwalks in the Garden of the Deadroom on Track & Field. It's a stronger, more cohesive jaunt, drifting into a singer/songwriter vein. So maybe this is seen as a collection of outtakes? Or outerrealm stuff that couldn't make it elsewhere? Whatever its lack, Barker/Hauser can't be faulted for attempting oceanic sprawl, but when players aren't razorsharp regarding improv's ebb and flow, noodling grows ponderous fast. Here, instead of covering ground like trueblue Impulse!/Siren worthy explorers, Currituck Co.'s just treading water. "}
