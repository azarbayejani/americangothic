{"label":" Monitor","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/5579/homepage_large.d3db935b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"More Dogs","title":"Never Let Them Catch You Crying","text":" \"The end of the album is nigh, maaan.\" Grizzled rockwriters and idealistic technosavants have been waving that apocalyptic placard for years now (sheesh, millennia!). Here's More Dogs, latest tombnail in tow. Seven tracks, 28 minutes: An EP, right? Warm bowl of miso soup, sashimi tray still TK? But these ramshackle Baltimorebased atmospherevendors are calling Never Let Them Catch You Crying a fulllength, and for once, I'm not gonna argue. What More Dogs' second ahem ellpee (first for Monitor) lacks in length, it makes up for with bigtop instrumentation, Nosferatu organs, rhythmic fakeouts, and mood enough to send noted psychiatry expert Tom Cruise to his meds. Never Let Them is primarily instrumental, aside from the Zombieslike harmony that essentially bookends the album: \"When I think of you I think of sunshine, sunshine.\" After those words, the title track fades into the sound of a crackling bonfire or approaching stampede. Both lyrics and, indeed, conventional melodies soon recede behind gloomy/anarchic scenesetting and a tumultuous story arc left largely to the imagination. So, imagine: Second track \"Duty. Duty? Duty.\" is a stranger walking in an unknown metropolis, past the waterfront, along ratinfested streets bespattered with pissy puddles. Vibraphones, acoustic guitar, bass and dramatic organ portray a man alone amid urban hurlyburly. On \"Teenage Bunker\", percussion conquers all, clanging and clopping like a gruesome \"Sleigh Ride\" atop a suspenseful, spreadout bass line that soon grows violent. Rockists' friend Mr. Electric Guitar finally grabs a starring role on \"White People\", which during its quiet midsection evokes Radiohead's \"Exit Music (for a Film)\". Watch out, \"Overeater Under Water\" follows with the postpunk card (disco hihat!), but the heehaw bass line and modal guitar sketching still sound equally akin to a Russian folk dance. Disorientation gives way to vivid standout \"March to the Scaffold\", where further horrorshow organ stabs, lunatic percussion and vibraphones conjure up a public spectacle. An execution? Bass murmurs like a milling throng. Then \"This Is the One\" closes the disc in the red, mortally convulsing with feedback and cascading guitar nose. The album is dead; long live... shit. More Dogs would never be so obvious. "}
