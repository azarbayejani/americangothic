{"label":" Bella Union","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13347/homepage_large.1ce50b1f.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"The Czars","title":"Goodbye","text":" The best word to describe the Czars is \"elegant.\" It's the only word you could apply to all of the Denver quintet's music, from their loudest, fastest moment to their iciest piano passage. They bring their stately approach to a sound that migrates freely through cabaret, prog, country, folk, jazz, chamber music, and arena rock, often with a subtle electronic edge. The crux of that sound is the voice of pianist John Grant, a powerful, rangy instrument he's not shy about wielding in all its booming glory. His piano playing is often just as weighty, and he opens Goodbye with a chilly impressionist meditation reminiscent of the dolorous midsection of Procol Harum's \"In Held 'Twas I\" before the title track clicks in with a gliding modern r&b; groove. \"Goodbye\" is full of twists and turns, pulling its minor key melody through tempo changes and harmonized Radar Brothers slocore detours in a sort of microcosmic sampler of the album in full. The album's most impressive song, the soaring, crystalline ballad \"Paint the Moon\", has an exhilarating, simple melody, dramatic chord progressions, and a sweeping arrangement. The guitars spread like the sun on the Eastern slope of the Rockies, fanning out in twanging, echoing eternity over Jeff Linsenmaier's militaristic drums. Grant croons with heartstopping authority and the chorus lifts off like a child's lost, melancholy balloon. Nothing else on the album quite touches that tingling peak, but the record is full of ideas and unique arrangements, smothering the credible softrock of \"The Hymn\" with ghostly harmonies and spacey electronics and leaping into electroprog territory on \"I Am the Man\", with Grant ceding his humanity to a vocoder over hammering drums and squealing synth. \"Trash\" bursts into a ridiculous bout of fretboard fireworks with guest guitarist Richard Odell spouting off \"Eruption\" style, while \"Pain\" rocks in more of a Euroindie fuzz vein. And then there's the stunning \"Little Pink House\", a jazz burner stuffed with trumpet and fat piano chords, both guest Julie Monley and Grant singing straight from their guts. The Czars are, in short, an impressive band with a handle on how to properly synthesize a plethora of strong influences. Though it has its moments of excess (really, that \"Trash\" solo is a bit overboard), Goodbye is a luxurious album of subtle, exactingly crafted pop that's easy to come back to. "}
