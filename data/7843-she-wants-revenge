It seems every week someone's crying wolf over a new Joy DivisionviaInterpol soundalike that's really only a halfhatched postpunk band with a stuffy nosed singer. Yet this L.A. duo practically copies Interpol's DNA with a genrewarping flair that'd crush the Bravery's Skabba the Hutt dude. You see, She Wants Revenge bears more resemblance to Soulwax than, say, the Killers. DJs Adam \"Adam 12\" Bravin and Justin Warfield spawned this indie chameleon after several years of dabbling in the West Coast club scene, most notably Warfield's promising 1993 Prince Paulproduced rap debut and his sophomore slumpy arena rock album released under the moniker The Justin Warfield Supernaut. Rappers turned indie rockers? Heresy! Well, on a fundamental level, probably, but SWR circumvents the genre integrity question with precision and timetested professionalism. While Warfield and Bravin don't deserve bonus points for actually being teenagers during the 80s as they suggest, they're studio rats who trouble and toil for the exact sounds necessary to propel their mediocre songwriting. Also, they're not making any effort to hide their influences. Titles like \"I Don't Want To Fall In Love\" and \"Tear You Apart\" are lazy permutations of postpunk poetry, and the whole psychotic female protagonist shtick spans from \"She's Lost Control\" to \"Stella Was a Diver And She Was Always Down\". Basically SWR songs come in two breeds sprawling drone operas รก la \"PDA\" sans catchiness, and clubby gothstompers that force Madchester scenery on unreceptive American audiences. Single \"Sister\" captains the former category, dropping an overcast surf riff that crashes at the chorus, tboning an equally menacing synth. Problem is, all the rock tracks have the same melody, so if you didn't like the guitar/vocals interplay on \"Sister\" you'll really hate it on opener \"Red Flags And Long Nights\", and by \"Someone Must Get Hurt\" you'll already have turned your iPod off to watch 24 Hour Party People. Like so many midlevel retro bands, SWR feel most comfortable playing the dancerock card, though the strategy creates a glass ceiling. Sure, the hooks on \"I Don't Want To Fall In Love\" and \"Monologue\" strike the hardest, but at best they're eerily predictable. The rhythm section doesn't help either, permanently stuck on a default setting somewhere between industrial and Duran Duran. Sadly, the brightest spots burn the shortest, such as the twoandahalf minute fugue \"Disconnect\" or Pornography offspring \"Us\". Too ugly and inaccessible to suggest some sort of postpunk cashout, they stick out in a batch of songs too bent on edifying studio wizardry over musicianship. "}
