And maybe, in 2003, it didn't: When a series of throughthemail beat trades between Madlib and Jay Dee eventually coalesced into a fulllength collaboration, the final result felt a little gimmicky at first. A pair of producer/MCs taking turns rhyming over each others' beats is unconventional enough, but when both of them had such disparate approaches at the time ever try listening to Jay Dee's smooth, uncluttered banger Welcome to Detroit and Quasimoto's blunted, dubbedout The Unseen back to back, much less shuffled together? it was hard not to feel initially disoriented. Many critics (this one included) originally saw it as an enjoyable if disjointed effort, then eventually forgot about it once Madvillainy dropped a few months later. Stones Throw's reissue of Champion Sound, then, seems to work largely as a \"hey, remember this?\" nudge, coming off the heels of the recent deluxe edition of Dilla's Ruff Draft EP in a similar bid to reestablish the value of an underheard record. Unlike Ruff Draft, Champion Sound was a widelyreleased, fullfledged album more slepton than scarce and it's aged a bit better than early reviews might've anticipated. More than a few underground rap albums these days have shot for Champion Sound's stonedintheclub vibe and fallen short, while Stones Throw has become indie rap's \"it\" label in recent years with albums much like this: collaborative efforts infused with Madlib's unpretentiously avantgarde spirit, weird enough to stay on the margins of current pop culture but accessible enough to stick on Cartoon Network's [adult swim] (where it seems a bit less bizarre next to willfully batshit stuff like \"Saul of the Mole Men\"). The main thing to keep in mind about Champion Sound is that the two main artists involved adapted to each other's production styles just as much as they contrasted. It's easy to theoretically pit Madlib's muddy, crackly, blownout organics as a barelycompatible counter to Dilla's pristine digital precision, but there's a stylistic bleedthrough that seeps both ways. Madlib's beats here lack much of the skewed jazz eccentricity that his more familiar Quasimoto and Madvillain productions do. Instead, he finetunes his approach so that his more farout tendencies reassembled bop flotsam and beats that have a hard time staying put are left to sneak in through the margins. There's odd little touches like the title track's Bollywood vocal (which, post\"Addicted\", didn't skew too far away from the mainstream anyways), the piercing, slightly warpedsounding sustained string note that runs through most of \"The Mission\" and the Asian/MiddleEastern horn that trills through \"Survival Test\". But like the best Dilla tracks, the bass and drums are at the forefront and do most of the heavy lifting, and a couple of Madlib's beats, like the booming fistpump rhythm of \"McNasty Filth\" and the insistent stutterthump of \"Strapped\", feel like lowfi versions of Jay Dee's Slum Village work.  Dilla's tracks don't rewrite his own plan as much which makes sense, since many of them preceded the idea of the collaboration in the first place but they're a bit filthier than usual, his glowing digital bass pushed until it strains; not for nothing is his best beat on here, a heavy slab of bigbottomed gfunk built around a disembodied soul wail and a airlocktight drum loop, repurposed for a track called \"The Red\". And there's a few points that pick up the slack for the progfusion bizarreness Madlib pushed to the background: the melody for \"React\" is based around what might be a guitar riff or a clarinet sped up to a hummingbird tempo, \"Raw Shit\" hammers away at a tinny Farfisa that sounds like it's on its last legs, and \"Strip Club\" features a giggly steel drum that's about as sexy as a coconut bra.  Even if they're not much worth commenting on lyrically \"Shoulda never been allowed in the game/ All y'all fake gangstas now\" and \"My thug niggas know what I mean/ A live bitch, that's what I need\" are typical Jay Dee lines, while Madlib's appeal is mostly in his muttering, halting delivery the vocals also fit their productions in a complementary way. Jay Dee's elementary rhymes seem as looselyassembled and grimy as Madlib's beats, while Madlib returns the favor by vocally skulking across Dilla's precision engineering with his conversational counterrhythms. A few guests keep things switched up: Kweli's turn on \"Raw Shit\" has more value in his endearingly ridiculous halfsung hooks than his unremarkable verses, FranknDank give \"McNasty Filth\" the confident swagger the teartheclubup beat requires, and Percee P throws out so many acrobatic battlerap turns of phrase on \"The Exclusive\" (\"Perce is nice, worth the price, every verse entice/ one of the most praised men to surface twice on this earth since Christ\") that it's easy to forget he's only rapping for about 40 seconds. Along with the requisite bonus disk of instrumentals and a couple hardtofind bonus tracks (including the hilarious Madlibhelmed \"Pillz\" \"Oh shit, I just took an X pill/ now I'm ready to thwoop\"), the supplemental material includes a handful of remixes that don't quite fit in with Champion Sound's original vibe. The beatboxdriven remix of \"The Official\" and the rework of \"Champion Sound\" that sounds like \"Whole Lotta Love\" on a busted harpsichord have their place on the second disc, far out of reach of their superior originals, but might not be enough to justify a purchase for fans who already got the CD first time around. Given its singledisc price, the Deluxe Edition of Champion Sound, like most reissues, has the most value for those who haven't gotten around to hearing the CD until now and they're coming to it at just the right time.
