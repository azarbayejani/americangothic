Consider how Kimi Recor chainsmokes her third clove and leers at a Juliet Capulet who watches a subway station's fluorescent ceiling as if bathed in divine light. \"People are such strange creatures,\" Recor purrs from the gut. \"So cold and lonely.\" An acoustic bass struggles to pass through the turnstile; the ticket machines' steady clicks and bleeps serve as incidental beats. Recor then mimics Juliet's whines \"I was dying before I was ever born!\" Her train arrives, 10 minutes late. \"Fuck those grieving motherfuckers!\" She exhales. \"Fuck 'em all!\" That was \"Strange Creatures\", the opener for John Tejada's latest microglitch techno excursion, Logic Memory Center. While Recor's spat is the most subversive moment here, the L.A.based producer still makes failures sound so goshdarn funky. It's fitting that his 10th album is named after the crimsonlit room where HAL 9000 sang \"Daisy\" in 2001: A Space Odyssey. His melodies are best described as \"absentee melodies\" in trimming off notes to the bone. True to his beloved Detroit techno's tradition, Tejada keeps a steady drum machine thump to not distract from the groove letting the melodic detritus swing on the dancefloor. Comparisons to techhouse mediadarling Matthew Dear are inevitable, but Tejada's sound has more fresh ideas. Although Tejada's arrangements can be too busy at times, and they often grow an acre of corn with UVlights and hydrophonic vats.Logic's best moments are its klutziest. \"Possessive Patterns\" marches to work at 5 a.m. to a rhythm that is still fixing its socks. The Future is seen through bleary eyes as this song's muttering organs and melodies that seemed looped from commercials polluting the downtown air, all attest. \"This Fake Place\" first sounds like it's printing itself out, given its grinding noises and acidtechno synths that try to maintain a watercooler conversation. \"Strive\" has an Akufenstyle microhouse chop that gets perverted by Looney Tunesfashioned rubberband wonks. \"Loose Change\", uncannily produces a tapdancing cadence that swings between guitar fragments and microtonal blips. Tejada's absenteemelodies don't always pay the bills and he should've done some quality control with his guest singers, James Figurine and Carl A. Finlow. The album closer, \"Something about the Drums\", putts along with a halfarsed, acidsynth squelch that doesn't complement a bush league house thump. Figurine delivers a cliche motivational speech on the otherwise engrossing, jazzsnap of \"Everything Will Be OK.\" And then there's Finlow on \"Alone with You\", a Depeche Mode karaoke number. He drops zingers like \"Shadows forming over walls/ Catch the moonlight as it falls,\" and \"Tasting a teardrop from her cheek/ Gives me strength when I am weak.\" Draw your own conclusions. "}
