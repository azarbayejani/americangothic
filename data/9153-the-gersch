Take one practicetape, passably recorded, and lose it. Rediscover, under the bed or, for a stronger vintage, in the basement. Then hail the longlost achievement, suitably shrouded in its new legend press and release. So goes the story of the Gersch, the practice and rehearsalonly side/secret project of Red Sparowes auteur and Isis player Clifford Meyer. Recorded throughout the latter half of the last decade, The Gersch now arrives in this one, presumably because, A) Red Sparowes had a pretty good year last year, and B) Gersch just so happens to be the type of gradual, postmetal artsleep that pays the bills in 2006. Pitched somewhere between Neurosis and Another Green World, Red Sparowes debuted in 2005 with At The Soundless Dawn, a wordless but moderately stirring piece of amplifier moodsetting. In the Gersch, Meyer's more present, dozing less at the wheel: His guitars are louder, the riffs quicker to come and go, and there's a vocal an automaton's wail, pitched high and inexpressive. On the cover, a pig lies trussed on a table; on the back, a skeleton hangs. Sometimes Meyer's music is that dark, that blackandwhite: On \"''taker\", over a druidic minor key, a whole cast of reapers chant into the wind, formal like a church service. And on \"Taekr\" the Celtic version, I guess every time one vocal enters, so do eight or nine others; they howl like ghosts in the background, while Meyer mumbles over guitars that lurch just before the vocals do. Fair enough. The Gersch are, despite their heavy metal aptitude, best when they fuck up their own genreal exercises. According to their publicist, a cover of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young's \"Ohio\" lurks on somewhere on Gersch my guess is the wanky, overlong closer, \"Your Lips Are No Man's But Mine\", which sounds vaguely like Neil Young, so close enough. Better still, and more accidental, is \"Listwish\", a wicked though accidental take on Boston's \"Foreplay/Long Time\" with a \"Communication Breakdown\" vamp thrown in for good measure. And both \"Face\" and \"Face Pt. 2\" sound most like 90s emo stuff like Universal Order of Armageddon or Sleepytime Trio slashing chords, jittery snares, and onthenoff time vocals. These inadvertent rock moments are, I suppose, happy accidents: Meyer's material, not surprisingly for a long dead sideproject, is a little thin (hence the semirecycled songs and song titles) and best when it's off course. Which is about every other song.  "}
