Their debut LP, Gold on Gold, is instantly charming, and at a time when so much middling synthpop is floating around, that's worth a lot. It also seems to pale, at first, in comparison to a holy trinity of very pronounced influences. It's not quite as debonair as Junior Boys, not quite as soulful as Hot Chip, and not quite as epic as fellow Melburnians Cut Copy. But all that \"not quite\" somehow adds up to quite a bit. Gold on Gold is as satisfying a take on indiedance as you're likely to hear until one of the aforementioned pacesetters drops a new album.Clubfeet compensate for their derivativeness with strong fundamentals: sugarsticky hooks, accomplished singing, and most importantly, sheer enthusiasm. (This is a band whose linernote credits include not just \"guitar\" and \"synthesizer\" but also \"fervour\" and \"teen spirit.\") Conceptually, Gold on Gold is a wellrounded package, balancing stylized adult aspirations with nostalgic teenage candor. On the cover, an airliner sails above what looks like the French Riviera, or somewhere just as tony and sublime. Inside, the jetsetting gives way to Heathers homages (\"Teenage Suicide [Don't Do It]\") and a cover of 90s modern rock radio staples James (\"Say Something\"). Delicately entwined synths and vocal refrains are discreetly underpinned by live bass and guitar. As a result, their \"Say Something\" reconciles the best parts of dancepop and alternarock, as all the moving parts lock in with the guitar and lift as one at the chorus.Like Hot Chip, Clubfeet have two primary singers: One has a winsomely high, mobile voice and handles a lot of the leads. His vocals are a little sultry, a little disconoir on tracks like \"Last Words\", and very sweet all the time. The other has a lower, plainer voice that's good for dim harmonies and atmospheric coloring, occasionally taking the lead on quiet storms like the deeply affecting \"Fall From Up Here\". That sliding scale of chipper and weary, anthemic and intimate, keeps the album from settling into a rote emotional register, even though it's split pretty cleanly between two song types: effervescent dancepop and candlelit ballads.In either mode, the melodies get under your skin. The only dud is \"Six Days\", and it's not bad, just forgettable. What's missing is the crisp, featherlight dynamics that characterize most of the album. Elsewhere, you can hardly get away from penetrating hooks and smooth caroms from neat little part to neat little part. Clubfeet's two most original and infectious songs, \"Teenage Suicide\" and \"D.I.E. Yuppie Scum\", both feature maniacal rollerskating chants and heavenly promsynths that... well, that actually sound a lot like Junior Senior and M83, respectively. So scratch the \"original\" thing. But don't let that deter you from this highly appealing surprise. "}
