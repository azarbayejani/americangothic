{"label":" Important","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/1816/homepage_large.2d0d5091.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Zach Baron","artist":"Diane Cluck","title":"Oh Vanille/Ova Nil","text":" Diane Cluck is the proverbial birthedinurbanwoods fawn (or, as one of her songs, says \"Wild Deer at Dawn\"): an \"outsider artist.\" Piano lessons at seven (denaturing her wideeyed talents); youngprodigy recital trainwrecks; circa 2003, the Dorland Mountain Arts Colony where she recorded half of Oh Vanille/Ova Nil was burned, and her own personal room, destroyed. Important pushed for two years just to get that first commercial release from her. Normalcy, or the burn of, well, everyday life: mythmaking, 20032006. She doesn't care what you think, as the backstory says; whatever problem you have, that problem is yours. Cynics will touch on the Pennsylvania Academy of Music classical training, her Devendra Banhart endorsement (\"I'm so happy to be alive at the same time she is because I get to see her perform\"), the Golden Apples of the Sun inclusion, AntiFolk affiliation, or the affirming twogoingonthree real record releases, as evidence of some worldly selfconsciousness. But I do not doubt she means exactly what she says. Why the smoke and story? Perhaps because her work is so monoexpressive, made from tunefulbutnottunes guitar strums, and her voice deeper and emotionalrangier than fellow scenester Marissa Nadler's, way less weird than Joanna Newsom's or, say, Genevieve Elverum's is doing all the thought and work. Listen to her, actually, according to an old interview: \"I believe anyone can write a good song if they would write exactly what they're thinking.\" So, Oh Vanille/Ova Nile and Countless Times; let's dispense with maturity or growth comparisons between these two 2005 releases; literalism doesn't age. \"Easy to Be Around\", Oh Vanille's centerpiece quarterlove song, does doubleup on the vocals (harmonies too) but floats in on the casual hook no points for guessing \"You're easy to be around.\" She might have charmed you, or sexjammed you (\"Have I told you how I like to see/ A man submit to ecstasy?\" off \"Half A Million Miles From Home\"), but the glow won't last: You don't even know her, that's gonna be problem over time, plus (dudes) I'm pretty sure she's married. I don't know...Dylan didn't do protest songs either. But nor did he do hearttohearts. Cluck's clanging guitar nonprogressions on \"Sandy Ree\" harmonize with her voice, which harmonizes with, well, another track of her voice. Beautiful, but even her twoway street is hermetic. David Marchese trackreviewed/castintoStarbucks \"Your Million Sweetness\" as audienceperformer disconnect (\"Maybe I'm the wrong demographic; maybe she is too\"); what he got at, I think, is the eerie fact there is no audience in Cluck's modes at all. Jandek's inward look (to name another hyperloner), at least, was oneanddone: Cluck's secondtolast Countless Times song is, take one, \"My Teacher Died/Countless Times\", and last song, take two, \"My Teacher Died\". Predictability's a real bitch. Is this because, again, she doesn't care, or because she's an (A)rtist, or is it both? Countless Times warbles \"Just As I Should Be\" into this kind of takeiteitherway insouciance: \"I'm not who you think I am. I'm not so good, I'm not so bad. I'm just as I should be.\" At parties, testimonials tend to make me finish my drink that much quicker; Cluck says \"All I Bring You Is Love\" but I doubt the pronouns. Her woodsmourning \"Sylvania\" (which seems to resent that William Penn dared to name Pennsylvania as he did, e.g. \"How dare he lay his name upon that tract of land?\") is so fucking strange and understated (not lyrically, but) why always the otherwise hard sell?
