{"label":" LaFace","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/9586/homepage_large.9945d7ea.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Julianne Shepherd","artist":"Ciara","title":"The Evolution","text":" In 2004, upon the release of Ciara Harris's excellent debut Goodies, Lil Jon christened the 21yearold Atlanta starlet the \"Princess of crunk & B.\" Crowning a firstalbum singer the Princess of ANYTHING is premature (witness Def Jam/RocaFella singer Teairra Mari: once \"Princess of the Roc,\" now dropped). But with CC, as we came to know her, the crown fit. As a breathy alto and successor to Aaliyah, she was no slouch a Dirty South debutante with melodies, moves, and moxie and Goodies was delicious, ripe with electrobass bits and yearmaking guest appearances (Ludacris on \"Oh\", what). OK SO, CHERCHEZ LA \"PRINCESS OF CRUNK & B.\"Goodies had no fat to cut. The Evolution is puffy with nonstunners and factory stamps. In Ciara's effort to prove herself a diva, her second album flails, bloated with spokenword interludes and boilerplate pop & b that obscures some truly good songs. On The Evolution, Ciara tries too hard to fashion herself after her idols Janet Jackson and Aaliyah. She overextends and overexplains, sacrificing her Southernness and stumbling on her own fleet feet.  It starts out strong, with the hiimpact Lil Jon bonecrusher \"That's Right\", in which Ciara asserts her right to party with her girls and have fun (or \"phone,\" as she puts it in her interminably charming downsouth brogue). That's followed by the excellent \"Like a Boy\", a stadium anthem about double standards dramatized by upandcoming coed production team the Clutch. But after the mondohit \"Promise\", the purplestorm Polow Da Don ballad Ciara serves like a sensual aprèsPrince, The Evolution begins its slow downward slide. Ciara wants to prove how much she's grown in two years, mostly by proffering grandstatement anthems and bland anysongs between metatracks about dancing and some genuinely solid pop singles. She intros many of these with lifecoachy spoken interludes and midsong soliloquies a throwback to Jackson's Control. Unfortunately, her generalized bon mots can come off forced, flat, and workhorselike, and they're not even all that personal (i.e., \"The past years of my life have truly been a journey\"). Standardissue tracks include:  1.\tTwo Missy Elliottstyle throwback jams (the Bambaataaesque \"I Proceed\" and \"Make it Last Forever\"), which producer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins patterned after Rob Base and EZ Rock's \"It Takes Two\". On the break, Ciara raps Base's iconic verse almost verbatim, which seems lazy, at best.  2.\tTwo kilnfired, \"babygirl\" type crossover singles, in the spirit of \"Like You\", her great duet with alleged exboyfriend Bow Wow. One song features 50 Cent and a musicbox synth (the admittedly delectable dopeboylover \"Can't Leave 'Em Alone\"). The other is called \"My Love\". Both conjure benched GUnit crooner Olivia.  3.\tOne weirdly wooden metaphor using the fit of her jeans as example of her growth as a person and artist. Stop talking… stay dancing!  Part of The Evolution's weakness is testament to the inevitability of producers like Darkchild, whose sound has been so distinct and so ubiquitous in the past year it's starting to feel like wallpaper. But Ciara's spokenword interludes are her own conceit, an assumption that we need her to tell us who she is. When Ciara's singing, production and assertions of grownwomanhood synergize, she rules both on the dancefloor and in the ozone. She hasn't earned the right to strut like a veteran, but on The Evolution, it's like she's forgotten she's already a Princess. "}
