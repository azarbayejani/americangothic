{"label":" Suicide Squeeze","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/10005/homepage_large.3bf9ed08.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Eric Harvey","artist":"Page France","title":"...And the Family Telephone","text":"  The word \"crooked\" pops up frequently in the lyrics to Page France's new record, and its two definitions apply to both sides of the band's oneofakind theatricality. \"Crooked\" can refer to either dishonesty or a physical irregularity, and on Page France and the Family Telephone, the group's third and weirdest album to date, singer and lyricist Michael Nau navigates both iterations; the lopsided celebration of \"Mr. Violin and Dancing Bear\" (\"You get what you get/ When you bite from the tree/ A crookeder you, and a crookeder me\") coming after the trickster vibe of albumopener \"The RubyRing Man\", in which he confesses: \"I lie so well, I even start to buy it, too.\" Over the course of Page France's three fulllengths, Nau has gradually removed himself as the lyrical focus. The boyish sensitivity of Come, I'm a Lion gave way to Hello, Dear Wind's conceptual folk, and on Telephone's \"Circus Head (Nobody Knows)\" he admits to creating an albumlong disguise for himself as a Barnum character a huckster, unsuccessful joketeller, and magician with a playfully devious streak. And in the long tradition of sad clowns, Nau is nothing if not painfully selfaware. In a voice reminiscent of Sonny Bono's pinched paisley caterwaul, he laments on \"A Belly to the Sea\": \"So I fear it's all a joke, that I just wasn't supposed to make/ Apples in a cloud of smoke/ So fake, I'm so fake.\" Then, on \"The Joker's Joke\": \"I am a stagefright comedian, that nobody wants to go see again/ My jokes are so long out of season, but they're laughing at me.\" Of course, like the fairy tales, Bible stories, and lullabies to which Telephone is clearly indebted, external sinister forces lurk just beyond the flower patches. Page France keep them at bay, partly with a miniature army of sunny guitars, glockenspiels, and the merry harmonies of Whitney McGraw, but also by motivating the more potent force of simple, blissful naivete. \"Beware the buginfested apples,\" Nau warns on \"Rooster and Its Crow\", before scampering up the tree and picking a basket full of them for his sweetheart. This instance of winsome romance streaks through Telephone, best expressed at the close of \"Wet Dog Afternoon\": \"I still love you dear, perhaps it gets the best of me sometimes.\"  As happens with all Page France records, Telephone's overt Christian symbolism will no doubt result in many scrambles to alternately celebrate or bemoan the Almighty's infiltration of indie pop. But those searching for evangelical underpinnings of Page France songs are barking up the wrong apple tree. Nau's interest is much more arty than devotional, merging surrealist lyrics (the sun as a giant \"eye,\" for example) with Biblical imagery (\"I led a king through flaming doors\") as a formal experiment, relying on both aesthetic traditions to help him express the dark underpinnings of even the most sunny scenarios.  This braiding of the unconscious with the Unknown, as crookedly rendered as it might be, is Telephone's greatest charm an inventive intertwining that gives the record a woozy, playful charisma. Like Danielson's Daniel Smith, Nau creates a loopy musical world concerned with the extratextual elements of organized religion, with any converts he attracts along the way merely interested in playing along. Like religion, music only exists inasmuch as it is performed, and on Telephone's closer \"Casting Day\", Nau seeks to recruit a new crop of participants for his next show, asking: \"Who do you wanna be? In that crooked afterlife, at the bottom of the sea?\"  "}
