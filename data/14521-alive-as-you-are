Whether intentionally or unwittingly, though, Darker My Love are taking plenty of cues from them. Just as BRMC put out a decent debut (2001's B.R.M.C.) and a samey, notsodecent followup (2003's Take Them On, On Your Own), Darker My Love's 2006 selftitled debut was a justokay neoshoegaze affair, while 2008's holyshitisthatreallythetitle 2 was a tepid sophomore effort that felt monochrome and dulledover.If the timeline holds true, Darker My Love's third album would be a strippeddown reinvention á la BRMC's own gamechanger, 2005's Howl. Lo and behold, Alive As You Are, ditches the delay pedals, obscured vocals, and squalls of noise for acoustic guitars, sweetly sung harmonies, and openroad clarity. Just as their previous two efforts pilfered repeatedly from longinthetooth veteran bands the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols, Alive As You Are mines the 1960's folkrock canon with a neardopey lack of shame. If the Dylanesque vocal aping on opening track \"Backseat\" doesn't make you blush for these guys' sake, try the following cut, \"Split Minute\", which is basically the Byrds' \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" sans any trace of the original's euphoric payoff.After a supreme early demonstration of pastiche, Alive As You Are's back half reveals a capable pop band writing capable pop songs. Ignore the slowdrawled intro of \"Trail The Line\" and you'll find the best Lemonheads jangler that band never wrote within. \"Dear Author\"'s psychout breakdowns are satisfying in a wouldbe Top 40 way, while \"A Lovely Game\" benefits from the record's clearheaded sound via its swooning vocal interplay.Cosingers Tim Presley and Rob Barbato are capable vocalists, and the album's best moments, like the shifting ballad \"June Bloom\" and the spring breeze arrangements of \"New America\", rely on wordless expressions and nimble harmonizing to get the job done. They're far from good lyricists, though. \"Split Minute\" hammers home false truisms (\"You are not you\" dude, that's deep) while the mind is boggled when \"New America\" moves its lyrical concerns from shipbuilding(!) to, uh, this: \"Spilt milk levee breaks on you\". On second thought, maybe all that guitar noise was there before for a reason. "}
