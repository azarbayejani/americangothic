{"label":" Merge","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/3358/homepage_large.fe3900a4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Ott","artist":"Ganger","title":"Canopy EP","text":" One of my comrades here at Pitchfork recently put forth the notion that derivative music is more acceptable to American ears if it's hopped the pond to reach them. Ganger had best hope so, because there's not much new here, and it's not very well presented. Amateur home recordings are fine by me, but make up your minds: some of this record sounds great crisp, like For Carnation but within two minutes, it degrades unrestrainedly into awkward clipping and analog distortion. Make no mistake, I'm not talking about studio wizardry a la Mogwai's \"Small Children in the Background;\" this sounds like someone's just not paying attention to the recording levels. Ganger want so much to surprise us with complex rhythms, but if you've heard one fourbar melody split in half, you've heard them all. Essentially, what we're hearing here is just Dianogah with guitar laid over it. And good luck, discerning one song from another these tracks are virtually interchangeable. It's hard not to see this as Merge Records' chip in the postSlint wastebasket. At least it's not another ProTools mathrock records, but Ganger are as faceless as any three college kids playing fauxcomplicated instrumentals to the bookworm contingent. I can't see them going anywhere special they're not especially talented, technically speaking, so they're not going to break new ground in the syncopation department. And as the milieu they operate in is so thoroughly inundated with comparable releases, I wish everyone good luck in remembering it six months from now. "}
