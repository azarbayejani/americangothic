Kane","title":"69","text":" Initially dismissed as \"the black Jesus & Mary Chain\" by selfamused, callous critics, London's A.R. Kane still languish in formidable obscurity. More upbeat and psychedelic than the Reid brothers' chainsaw monotony, the duo's early EPs partially produced by the Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie outlined the breathier bliss that would define the UK's shoegaze craze (though the band always referred to their music as \"dreampop\").Embracing dub, soul and paisley pop, A.R. Kane pushed boundaries most of their contemporaries completely ignored. Open to any and everything, they moved past dreampop in 1987, collaborating with 4AD labelmates Colourbox on the scratch heard round the world: \"Pump Up the Volume\". But no matter how often their name appears in discussions of that decadedefining track, and even discounting their contribution to a genre that draws so many obsessive fans (shoegaze), it seems the world won't listen.\"Anitina\", the thundering flipside to \"Pump Up the Volume\", wasn't a collaboration, and was billed as an A.R. Kane track, but 1988's 69 LP revealed that its unreal boombox beat was a red herring, aimed at selling the uninitiated on feedback and dizzy vocals. Though hugely influenced by the Cocteau Twins' mid80s peak, 69 drew equally from dub's disregard for sonic structure, disappearing into distant echoes that strikingly predict the succulent Seefeel. Unfortunately, history's been unkind to the dinky drum machines that open 69; \"Suicide Kiss\" predicts heavier shoegaze acts like Swervedriver and the God Machine, but it and \"Crazy Blue\" at the time the record's catchiest tracks, and consequently sequenced first are awkward anachronisms. 69's reputation owes entirely to the minimalist syncretism that follows: Sunny watercolors (\"Baby Milk Snatcher\", \"Scab\") give way to damp concrete (\"Sulliday\"), ushering in the album's hallmark, the oddly titled masterpiece \"Spermwhale Trip Over\". A singular influence on Bark Psychosis and the aforementioned Seefeel, the track's presenttense update of the Cocteau Twins' ethereal elegies is perhaps the group's defining moment.Many critics consider A.R. Kane more academically than aurally crucial, and, limiting the discussion to their firstwave fulllengths, there's some truth to the argument. i, the duo's 26track swan song from 1989, is needlessly bloated by ten interwoven sound snippets, each a distraction more than an interlude. With only slight cynicism, one could brand the soundscapes suspect misdirection, when you consider the drastic shift toward clearer production and pop choruses. The minor UK hit \"A Love from Outer Space\" borders on Club Nouveau in its synthpop radioreadiness, which in itself isn't crime, but, paired with Lisa Stansfield techno pop (\"Snow Joke\") and a direly overproduced ballad owing as much to Foreigner as Elizabeth Fraser (\"Sugarwings\"), i is, on sober reflection, a stylistically incontinent album.Rudi Tambala later confessed, \"When you're young, pride is a deadly thing. We didn't give a shit, we were totally selfindulgent.\" While it worked for Rudi and Alex Ayuli at the outset, their unchecked ambition became a fragmentary force, diluting i irretrievably. Were it not for the redeeming excellence of the album's last movement (the tracklist is divided in quarters), trumpeters would have a hard time convincing anyone of A.R. Kane's genius. The mounting simplicity of \"Down\", however, is too gorgeous and prescient to ignore. A longcelebrated rallying point for the nascent shoegaze movement, \"Down\", and its raging partner \"Supervixens\", deliver on the promises 69 made to the underground, shepherding them from C86 jangle into sensual, reverbdrenched atmosphere. Closing with some fine and druggy hotstep reggae (the aciddrenched \"Catch My Drift\") and the hilariously audacious lightsout sample \"I just challenge anyone to listen to them and not cry!\", i leaves you aching for another sip of its last quarter, and not a little sorry for A.R. Kane, who never gave their vintage time to ferment. "}
