As if they had a choice: When Coldplay's Radioheadlite grandeur met Lou Barlow's emotional verisimilitude, Lightbody's opening slot for hoary archanthemmongers U2 was assured. But now, a mixtape? Quick, you grab his legs while I mock his record collection! OK, so you noticed the number at the top of the page. Turns out Lightbody's entry for Family's The Trip series (previous participants: Dirty Vegas, Saint Etienne) had me if not your grandma at Sex in Dallas's \"Everybody Deserves to Be Fucked\". Does Keane listen to French electrohouse, too? Didn't think so. Over two discs, \"Bert\" and \"Ernie\", Lightbody puts to plastic the stuff of his recent DJ (!) sets: chillout electronica and indie, c. 2004. Notably absent: Barlow, Coldplay, My Bloody Valentine. In fact, Lightbody's Trip is best when it sounds more like Optimo's recent How to Kill the DJ [Part Two] than last year's Grandaddycurated, Snow Patrolfeaturing Below the Radio comp in other words, when it's more like the club than the arena. Most of Lightbody's dancier offerings are scattered throughout disc one, including the hilarious Sex in Dallas cut, Four Tet's typically organic \"Everything Is Alright\", and Mylo's Daft Punkinflected \"Drop the Pressure\" (motherfucker!) plus, y'know, TV on the Radio (the single, natch). Lightbody closes the disc with the stylish jazzpop of Feist's \"Mushaboom\". Even when Lightbody treads more expected ground the Shins, sometime Snow Patrol guitarist Iain Archer his picks are more likely to evoke his band's casual first two albums than last year's highpolish Final Straw. Make merry with Joy Zipper's dreamy \"Christmas Song\". Ponder where CocoRosie's bluesy number got those inane lyrics. Get shot up GUnitstyle (don't worry, it won't kill you) by Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum for remaining ambivalent toward Fiery Furnaces' \"Bow Wow\". Then wonder what a funk workout by Bill Withers has to do with any of this. If you read Pitchfork last year and did all your homework, little of The Trip will strike you as an epiphany. The tracks are illuminative if rarely breathtaking, and will likely yield most listeners a discovery or two. Then again, we've all put together mixtapes: Does Lightbody really like Deerhoof, or does he just want the girl from Brit Lit to think he does? "}
