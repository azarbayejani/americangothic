The pivotal moment comes right near the end of the compilation, with the June 67 single \"Cold Sweat\", a song that made every other soul musician in the world break out in one. (Jerry Wexler is quoted in the liner notes: \"No one could get a handle on what to do next.\") On \"Cold Sweat\", Brown traded concrete song form for a selection of rhythmic hooks, unresolved chords, and twonote gestures; he cut loose drummer Clyde Stubblefield to play a solo breakbeat at a time when nobody even knew what a breakbeat was; he called for Maceo Parker's saxophone solo as if spontaneously directing his band on stage rather than recording in a studio. It was the most commanding groove anybody had ever heard, and it made everything else on the radio sound stale and starched by comparison. And then he did it again, a couple of months later, with \"Get It Together\". Some of the second half of Volume Four boils down to development and research for the breakthrough of \"Cold Sweat\", especially the jackedup rhythms of \"Bring It Up\" and \"Let Yourself Go\" and the previously unreleased instrumental twoparter \"It's a Gas\" (originally credited to \"The James Brown Dancers\"). But what's notable is how much of the twodisc set isn't, and how much of it is firstrate. (Note: \"firstrate\" is about three rates away from his organ solos, which this time are inflicted on instrumental covers of Ray Charles and Martha & the Vandellas hits. They can't all be winners.)  For most of 1966, Brown was working a kind of swinging bigbandviaR&B vibe the boogaloo beat he documented in \"Ain't That a Groove\" and its instrumental cousin \"New Breed\", as well as the slightly more programmatic but equally delightful \"Money Won't Change You\" and \"Don't Be a DropOut\". He scored another ballad hit with \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\", which replaced \"Lost Someone\" as the emotional core of his live show for the next 40 years, but he didn't bother going back to that mode for a while on his singles (aside from a peculiar, threeyearold cover of George Gershwin's \"I Loves You Porgy\" that dodged the charts altogether in 67); he revisited Wynonie Harris' \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" and Wilbert Harrison's \"Kansas City\", and reupgraded his previous upgrade of the \"5\" Royales' \"Think\" as a duet with Vicki Anderson. And he knocked out three Christmas singles in 66, one of which implies that nobody dared to suggest he might want to edit a hook and title that goes \"Let's Make Christmas Mean Something This Year\", and one of which is a brilliant demonstration of his craft: on one side, he croons \"The Christmas Song\" in a solid imitation of polite, Charles Brownstyle R&B; on the other, he uses basically the same arrangement, but cuts loose on it, James Brownstyle, slurring, howling and rewriting its melody on the fly.  There's only one taste on Volume Four of the fury of Brown's live shows, and it's very short just over 100 seconds but astonishing. \"Tell Me That You Love Me\", the Bside of \"Don't Be a DropOut\", is a razorwire tangle of shrieks and tape loops, a single verse that breaks down into a wallshattering series of screams, then repeats the whole process. The liner notes tell the story: It's a few fragments of tape salvaged from a scrapped live album's rewrite of Junior Walker's \"Shotgun\", and bludgeoned into something like a releasable recording by production manager Bud Hobgood. There's never been another record like it, and by the time it came out, James Brown was moving so fast that he'd already forgotten about it.  "}
