{"label":" Paper Bag","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/12089/homepage_large.f88ba0c3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stuart Berman","artist":"Slim Twig","title":"Derelict Dialect","text":" If the name and face of Slim Twig seem familiar to you assuming you're not a regular concertgoer in downtown Toronto it's probably because you recently took a chance on a rental of The Tracey Fragments, a bizarro 2007 psychodrama from director Bruce McDonald in which Slim stars opposite a preJuno Ellen Page (but with background music provided by Broken Social Scene instead of the Moldy Peaches). I bring this up not to score quick Google hits from curious Ellen Page fans (though thanks for sticking for around if this is how you wound up here), but to suggest that knowledge of Slim's acting career goes some way to help understand the music he creates. Not all of it, mind you; as one half of Toronto garagepunk duo Tropics, Slim simply lets loose with a feral take on the Birthday Party's blitzkrieg blues. But the two releases that bear his own name the Derelict Dialect and Vernacular Violence EPs are more revelatory looks inside the actor's studio, capturing both the desire to cultivate a persona and extract an enduring mythology from it.So fascinated is Slim with documenting the process of his own becoming that his first widely available release, Derelict Dialect (issued this past spring on Paper Bag Records), is essentially an oddsandsods collection doubling as creation myth. The sevensong minialbum collects early experiments that would assume a more steely shape on the new Vernacular Violence EP, whose songs were recorded after the Derelict Dialect material, but several of which were actually first released beforehand last fall in a limited local run under the title of Whiite Fantaseee. Having approached Derelict Dialect after spending several months with the Whiite Fantaseee/ Vernacular Violence material, what's immediately striking is that, for recordings made months apart, the two relate very little to one another and that, depending on your perspective, Slim has either evolved or stripped his music down to its pure essence.Derelict Dialect does introduce elements that would become more pronounced on Vernacular Violence: Slim's fondness for selfreflexive characterization (see: \"The Austere Gentleman\", an offkilter ode to oldschool virtues) and an overdriven analogkeyboard fuzz that immediately aligns him with an oftinvoked reference point, Suicide. But rather fasten him to that band's synthpunkabilly tradition and ascetic cool (that would come later), Derelict Dialect documents the messy process of, as Slim likes to call it, \"songsculpting\" where you're not sure what exactly you're creating until you take a step back from it. And even then you're not quite sure what you're looking at: \"The Replica & the Martyr\" Derelict Dialect's most intriguing and confounding track finds Slim leaning on his keys and harmonizing with himself in ominous monotone over a marital drum beat, only to switch up the game plan a minute in, leaving the original melody to defend itself against a ringing, repeated piano chord and a flurry of arrhythmic ticks.Derelict Dialect's wobbly foundations a collapsing pawn shop of wheezing synths, beatup acoustic guitars, and hiccupping drums are manifest in Slim's elastic voice, which assumes the devilish tenor of Liars' Angus Andrews (\"The Replica & the Martyr\", \"Birthing & Birthing\"), Dylanesque nasally ascensions (\"Trembeltongue\") and even motormouthed hiphopped spiel (\"The Austere Gentleman\"). But despite its occasional bouts of scatterbrained inscrutability, there is a certain logic at play here: the carnivalistic quality of that pervasive keyboard sound serving as an apt reflection of the songs' funhousemirror shapes.Perhaps by design, \"Trembletounge\" closes out Derelict Dialect with two minutes of eerie, hauntedhouse organ drones a retroactive setting of the scene for Vernacular Violence's zombie agogo. While ostensibly more minimal in presentation than Derelict Dialect with that album's seasick rhythms replaced by precise drummachine motions Vernacular Violence immediately feels more fleshed out: Slim sashays into the loungelizard lechery of \"Brothl Hunting!\" and the sleazy samba of \"Tormen\" with a newly perfected Nick Cave bellow that lends him a more creepy charisma, and a more coherent set of lyrical signifiers (shark skin suits, snakeoil salesmen) to better complement the grease in his pompadour. (Though curiously, the one new track that distinguishes Vernacular Violence from its previous Whiite Fantaseee edition, \"Street Proposition\", is a morose beatboxtroubadour warble that's more in line with Derelict Dialect's hermetic aesthetic.)True to his selfreferential persona, Slim explicitly outlines his transformation in \"Gate Hearing!\" which refashions the austere gentleman of old as \"that elegant smoker with the hair so slick and styled that there ain't another man for at least 10 miles, baby.\" But for even more compelling evidence of Slim's progress, look no further than the EP's mesmerizing 10minute centerpiece, \"Whiite Fantaseee\", in which Slim's growing confidence as a performer dovetails with his early interests in exploratory composition, producing a futureshocked junkiepunk epic that plays out like Suicide's \"Frankie Teardrop\" recut with Lou Reed's \"Street Hassle\" string section. Atop a ticktock beat that doesn't waver for the song's entire duration, Slim lets his voice echo through a desolate cityscape for two minutes before his repeated incantation of the song's title summons an overwhelming swirl of cellos and layer upon layer of intensifying synth drones; when Slim returns at the fiveminute mark to shout out the song title again overtop this sinister symphony, his reverbdrenched voice trembles with the dread of someone who can't believe what he's wrought even the drum machine sounds a little spooked before the song slowly dissolves into a gothic funeral march. Never mind his multiinstrumental facility; like all fine actors, Slim Twig's real talent is making his fantassee feel so real. "}
