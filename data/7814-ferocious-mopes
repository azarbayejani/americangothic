{"label":" Ryko / Euphobia","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/7691/homepage_large.80b2f1de.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Say Hi to Your Mom","title":"Ferocious Mopes","text":" All the glowing reviews you may (not) have read for Brooklynbased Say Hi to Your Mom could well have been written by the oneman emo band's one man, Eric Elbogen. According to a KnightRidder article, Elbogen writes rock reviews under a pseudonym \"so he doesn't alienate labels he might want to partner with down the road\". Who knows, he might be writing these words right now. Or not: I took the L train to Bedford for the first time just Saturday night, but Elbogen already had a song about it and other yuppiehipster touchstones on last year's Numbers & Mumbles. Home recordists today, unlike early90s Sentridoh or even late90s White Town, have enough technology at their fingertips to sound major, in that \"indierock\"isthenew\"alternative\" kind of way. A certain careerism is sweeping even the onceartiest loft apartments. As a result, \"style is taking over,\" in the sardonic words of Say Hi's sonic forebear, Pedro the Lion's David Bazan, and songs are on the outs. Hence, Say Hi's arrangements happen to become less sugary (locarb craze?) and more darkly ArcadeFireanthemic on the outfit's third record, Ferocious Mopes especially on wistful, quietloud \"Dimensions and Verticals\" and \"The TwentySecond Century\". How convenient. On a homemade PC, Elbogen assembles slow, statuesque, selfconsciously \"indie\" rock with analog synthscapes, overlapping distorted guitars, lots of lowend, and Conorrifically quavering whispers. Lyrically, he makes two classic misapprehensions: quirkiness for originality, and sincerity for significance. So \"Poor Pete Is a Bit SelfConscious\" tells the tale of a wouldbe vampire over a stomping arena beat, while \"Recurring Motifs in Historical Flirtings\" (yep, that's the title) rides the chillysynthsareradagain trend to label \"let's just be friends\" \"the four worst words in our language\". Boo hoo hoo. Frustratingly, Elbogen would have genuine potential if he spent as much time on songwriting as on being fashionable. \"Yeah, I'm in Love With an Android\" is movingly odd, and the toobrief acoustic closer \"As Smart as Geek Is Chic Right Now\" stabs deeper than its lookatme title to describe the misfortune of toys accidentally given brains. \"Let's Talk About Spaceships\", from Numbers & Mumbles, is an alltherightnotes ballad of 21stcentury insecurity that could please fans of either Grandaddy or, gulp, Jimmy Eat World. Which reminds me: \"Marc Hogan\" is really just Jim Adkins' pen name. "}
