The air is buffeted by the malevolent cacophony of creepshow organs. People are wearing vaguely Nordic costumes and medieval weaponry. There's a lot of operatic caterwauling, zombieporn moaning and general grabassing about. Around the time the guy in a loincloth and horned helm climbs a Marshall stack and starts vamping with a broadsword, a moment of utter clarity descends, and you're struck by one of two revelations. It's either, \"Wow! I really enjoy art that revels in weirdness for its own sake and cuts through the monotony of daily life,\" or, \"Wow! This is really just a lowrent Renaissance Festival.\" Listeners' appreciation of Rah Bras's music will hinge on their threshold for aggressively affected, recondite art that produces discomfort and uncertainty. EPS has enough substance to evoke physical and emotional responses, but its defiant oddness seems tailored to evoke a cerebral one as well the small voice of that bespectacled theorywonk in the back of your head, muttering, \"Is it art?\" Which is a neat trick, considering that the impossibility of unraveling that question can prevent us from ever reaching the second, more pressing one: \"Do I like it?\"EPS collects three Rah Bras releases: two outofprint EPs (originally released on Lovitt in 1997 and Vermiform in 1998, respectively), and a 2003 Lungcast Records EP recorded live in Japan. On their 2001 Lovitt LP, Ruy Blas!, Boo Rah, Jean Rah and Isabellarah Rubella demonstrably settled into a cohesive and discernible style. Their gibbering hybrid of beerhall chants, dramatic pseudoemoting, spooky synths, throbbing rhythms, and tortured, swirling arrangements remained multiform and strange, but were internally consistent. This consistency is displayed on the 2003 live recording: The warm, propulsive lines of \"Pancheerah\", the industrialmeetsNewWave pulse of \"Skin = Chronized\", and the surprisingly faithful cover of the Isley Brothers' \"Conventions\" (here called \"Tokyo Bus Stop\") are all immediately identifiable as songs with inherent musical value. They're quite good: Imagine The Faint taking themselves a bit less seriously, with a rawer edge. But since the first two EPs, which comprise the bulk of this release, represent Rah Bras' formative years, it's not surprising that they're wildly inconsistent in terms of quality and style, as the band cast about in sundry directions without fully embarking on a single one. To find the good songs, you've got to wade through a bit of filler. Many of the pieces seem more like ideas for songs than completed compositions, and they veer erratically between being intriguing and completely uncalled for. Thus do homely little mutants like \"Nasty, Freak\", which sounds like CocoRosie aimlessly warbling over a 1980s Nintendo game soundtrack, jostle against excellent songs like \"R.C.M.\", where some guttural Tom Waits jive talk rolls into a woozy, male/female electronic juke joint boogie in the vein of recent Fiery Furnaces as distilled into one potent minute.  The first EP begins promisingly enough, with the Deerhoofian, melodic nowave of \"FYC\" and the sort of cheesy but catchy enough synthpop of \"Water Damage\", but the incipient momentum is broken by \"Bus Stop\", a grating collage of traffic sounds and detonating sonic shrapnel, and the meandering, demented singalong \"Great Garden\". The second EP is more consistent, pinioned by the detuned synthetic piano, loose percussion and maniacal callandresponse vocals of \"Dead Bass Thing\", the dense, recessed prog and muttering oration of \"Jim, the Spelunker\", and the Rocky Horrorstyle cabaret \"Subtlights\", but it's also interlarded with questionable choices like the indistinctive minorkey dirge \"Poisson\" and the vexing synthklezmer of \"Oui Oui Oui\". EPS is recommended to entrenched Rah Bras fans and those who want to frighten their parents, but newbies are encouraged to check out the more accessible and fully realized Ruy Blas! before venturing into these murkier, more treacherous environs.
