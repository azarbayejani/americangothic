Mad Professor and dub legend/guru Lee \\x93Scratch\\x94 Perry are being credited as having been heavily involved with Dubtometry a drastic reworking of Optometry, DJ Spooky's 2002 collaboration with NYC jazz wunderkind Matthew Shipp (avaiable on his Thirsty Ear label) but if CD inserts can be trusted, their touch was minimal and composite. Their names are attached to only a few of Dubtometry's seventeen cuts, including mere interludes and Perry's own \\x93Jungle Soldier\\x94; the prominent placement of their monikers on the album cover seems more like a calculated bid for credibility than an accurate representation of the artists and influences on this record, which runs the gamut from traditional dub to polished hiphop and DJ Krustflavored drum and bass. The album is mostly successful in its basic mission: taking jazzfusion and musiqconcrete source material and putting a ballsy urban spin on it, bringing out the head nodding libido buried deep inside Optometry's somewhat pretentious and consciously stolid though still impressive experimentation. Many of the remixers on Dubtometry drastically improve the quality of their chosen songs by cleverly augmenting their highly traditional jazz identity: The weak, yawning \\x93Parachutes\\x94 finds itself revitalized with the addition of lilting flute passages and a striding, solid drum beat, breathing life into the original's academic corpse, while DJ Goo masterfully reworks the loose, bloated \\x93Optometry\\x94 into a crisp slab of inebriated hiphop on \\x93Bomb Massive\\x94, replete with decayed synth bursts and a bassline that tops any of Spooky's upright work, topped off by sublime beatboxing from IsWhat? member Napolean . Goo's take on \\x93Ibid, Desmarches, Ibid\\x94 is equally successful at injecting fresh beats under the jazzbop skin, as is the slow Caribbean sleepwalk of Twilight Circus' \\x93Variation Cybernetique\\x94 remix, which retains the original's gaseous string section. The closer deserves extra props: Animal Crackers' epic, wheels of steel raid on \\x93Optometry\\x94 is a class clown worth getting detention with, or Charlie Brown packing heat. The most glaring exceptions are easily spotted. The lesser criminals in Colorform craft a jazzy house raveup from the rib of \\x93Sequentia Absentia\\x94 that's obviously lost in the wrong neighborhood at 2AM. JLive's contribution is the record's nadir, a tepid vocal track that samples a nondescript snippet of \\x93Optometry\\x94 and builds an equally faceless song; \\x93Asphalt (Tome II)\\x94 was one of the more feverish moments on Optometry, but in the hands of Negativland it's a disappointment, a looping afterthought that falls flat. The credit and blame belongs to all the players, not just the notables: Dubtometry's greatest mistake is not presenting its contents as an amoebic whole. Optometry sold itself on the names of its central contributiors, and the remix album suffers from a serious case of conceptual envy. But Dubtometry does bring some muchneeded swagger to the table in the house that Miller and Schipp built: the sometimes stuffy compositions found on the original disc get a kick in the ass and some tongue in the ear, and it's just the sort of stimulation that was needed. Everything's a little less inhibited this time around: be sure and check your drinks. "}
