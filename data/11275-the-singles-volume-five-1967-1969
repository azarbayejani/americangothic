The fifth volume of HipO's mailorderonly comprehensive collection of his singles catches him at both his extremes. These 43 tracks include 11 chart hits, some of them as good as anything anybody recorded in the 1960s \"I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)\", \"Say It Loud  I'm Black and I'm Proud\", and the unbelievable, skeletal vamp \"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\", which Alan Leeds' liner notes point out is full of instrumental errors, but, as Leeds puts it, \"what's wrong with a couple fumbles if the team wins the game?\" Some of the other hits, though, you may not have heard of, perhaps with good reason: the undistinguished ballads \"I Guess I'll Have to Cry, Cry, Cry\" and \"Goodbye My Love\", and especially \"America Is My Home\", a patriotic recitation that got him in as much trouble with the Left as his July 1968 tour of Vietnam to entertain troops. (He promptly won radicals back with \"Say It Loud,\" the hottest anthem of the Black Power movement which he stopped playing live a few months later.) The great side of Brown aphoristic, emphatic, so rhythmically sharp he could slice diamonds with a grunt had two insanely awesome bands in the period documented here. One was his touring group, led by Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis; the other was a white funk band from Cincinnati, the Dapps, who dropkicked \"I Can't Stand Myself\" out of the stadium. Their bassist Tim Drummond subsequently joined the Ellis ensemble for a while (and went on to play with Bob Dylan during his bornagain period), and Brown noted that \"Tim's not a white bass player, he's my bass player.\" Both the Dapps and the James Brown Band cranked out instrumental singles during this period, sometimes identified by each other's names, and usually working variations on J.B.'s hits: \"Bringing Up the Guitar\" revives a groove from \"Cold Sweat\" (and would later turn into \"The Popcorn\"), \"Gittin' a Little Hipper\" does the same for \"Get It Together\", the twopart \"Shades of Brown\" recalls \"Ain't That a Groove\", \"Believers Shall Enjoy (Non Believers Shall Suffer)\" is a vamp from \"Maybe the Last Time\". This set also includes a pair of killer twopart instrumentals, \"Soul Pride\" and \"In the Middle\", on which Soul Brother #1 doesn't actually play.  And then there's the embarrassing side of James Brown: the megalomaniac who thought he was a great keyboard player... or a good keyboard player. A lot of his singles at the time featured instrumental Bsides with piano or organ overdubs by Brown, and he had a habit of mixing his part to be twice as loud as the rest of the band. That might be acceptable if he didn't play more clams than a barrel of chowder: the twopart \"Maybe Good, Maybe Bad\" is far too optimistically titled, and he seems to keep forgetting what key \"Here I Go\" is in.  As with every volume in the series, though, there are some peculiar, lesserknown wonders here. 1968's trio of Christmas singles (banged out in three days in October) includes a fabulous little jam called \"Santa Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto\", and the Bobby Byrd duet \"Licking Stick  Licking Stick\" points toward the spiky crosschatter of his 1970 band. Even better is \"You Got to Have a Job\", a January 1969 duet with his companion from the Vietnam trip, soul howler Marva Whitney. The two of them call for saxophonist Maceo Parker to solo the same trick Brown had used as far back as \"Cold Sweat\" (mid1967 was an eternity ago, at the speed his music was evolving). But they keep crowing \"Maceo!\" back and forth at each other, just for the joy of showing off their loud, glorious powers.  "}
