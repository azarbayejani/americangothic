As the exemplary reissue label Blood and Fire demonstrates with their every release, dub is all about the clash of human creativity and technological ineptitude. King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry were pioneers because they overcame the gulf between their imaginations and the thriftstore sound equipment they had access to. Thus, Tubby relied on the beloved primitive sound effects of accidental tapehiss and dropouts as much he relied on the echo chamber. Very few presentday digidubbers resist the temptation to defuzz and cleanse their rootical offerings. Like Ryan Moore's Twilight Circus Dub Sound System and Oswald von Moritz's Rhythm and Sound project, the Austrian quartet Sofa Surfers relish and emulate the mystical lofi glamour of classic dub. But unlike Moore and von Moritz, Sofa Surfers are not mere copyists. Cargo, the band's unnerving and astounding debut album, plotted a course from Crooklyn dub (\"Container\") and Ital wisdom (\"Sweat\") to Massive Attackish futurefunk triphop (\"The Low Rider\") and avantmetal Rastafarian hiphop (\"Beans and Rice\"). The remix album, Constructions, magnified Cargo's oppressive hydroponic power with dubs and reworkings by such sunshy, sunkencheeked masters of the outthere, slomo roller as Spectre, Mad Professor, Howie B and Eardrum.Encounters is no doubt intended as a continuation of the collaborative aesthetic of Constructions. Yet, despite Sofa Surfers' valiant attempts, the record suffers occasionally from threadbare talent having a shoddy go at underground hiphop or slouchy lounge ballads. In such cases, Sofa Surfers relegate themselves to providing moody soundscapes for their guests to faff around in. However, when they encounter true talent, the quartet approaches the essential toughness of Cargo. This record opens with \"Formula,\" featuring wouldbe macker Sensational and his claims about being the \"real deal\" and \"too much for ya.\" Sensational rides a crisp drumtrack similar to Cargo's \"Container\" and Axelrody breaks that DJ Shadow and other cratediggers have been appropriating for years. The thesaurusplundering wordplay continues with Oddateee's \"21st Century Army.\" Oddateee's message is the standard vision of a Blade Runner future. But despite the Corporation's oppression of masses, Oddateee lives up to his nom de guerre by proclaiming himself an oddity who's as \"large as an aircraft carrier.\" Wow. What a flat simile. Oddateee isn't exactly in Saul Williams' league. \"River Blues,\" features the droopy, drawled vocal talent of Jeb Loy Nichols. The cut previously made an appearance on Sincerely Yours, Klein Records' most recent label compilation, but failed to shine much amongst all that disc's fluff. Here, in its true context, it is, unsurprisingly, not much better. But at least the scratchadelic bridge makes some sort of sense after Sensational's and Oddateee's raps. Still, the Surfers only exert themselves about as much as Nicols, losing steam after drudging up a heap of wornoutgroove fuzzhiss. It takes the dancehall chat of DJ Collage and \"Babylon Tymes\" to get things bouncing out of complaisance. While Collage doesn't have the gruff fury of Elephant Man or the righteous zeal of Sizzla, his Babylonvexing patter spurs Sofa Surfers into laying down a feisty echoabundant roller. Then comes the avantgarde illbience of \"Twisted Tongue,\" serving as a nice transition between the routine of the disc's first half to the more adventurous and successful second. Featuring the dynamic duo of Techno Animal and 2nd Gen collaborator Dälek, \"Elusive Scripts\" bucks as \"Formula\" should have. Dälek doesn't have to fake like Sensational. He's a thoroughly credible MC who doesn't rely on dopey bragging rhymes to proclaim his greatness he shows rather than tells. With \"See the Light,\" Junior Delgado makes an irrefutable case for him to take over Horace Andy's position in Massive Attack. With talent like Delgado, Sofa Surfers have to come up with something special. Using Massive Attack's crawling version of John Holt's \"Man Next Door\" as a model, \"See the Light\" is unmistakably this album's standout cut. Dawna Lee comes on like a supersultry Dawn Penn, thus making \"Witness\" a knockout gorgeous R&B; ballad. But in direct opposition to the beauty of \"Witness,\" the collaboration with exPop Group member and On U Sound System affiliate Mark Stewart, \"Home Truth,\" is a hamfisted industrial dub rocker. Stewart, it seems, is never going to achieve the distinction of his 1990 electrodub masterpiece Metatron, and Sofa Surfers don't appear too keen on helping him better himself.Encounters ends quite unexpectedly with the skipping, skuzzedup marimba jaunt \"Gamelan,\" which recalls the ingenious playfulness Klein Records' star artist, Seelenluft. It's almost as though Seelenluft is an uncredited guest here. \"Gamelan\" makes the inescapable point that Sofa Surfers don't really need guests and collaborators to make unique and engaging music. In fact, Encounters proves that, more often than not, the guests prevent the band from stretching themselves, and hinder them from matching or exceeding their remarkable Cargo and Constructions. Go it alone next time, boys. "}
