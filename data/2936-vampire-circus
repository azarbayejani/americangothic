{"label":" Southern Lord","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/2911/homepage_large.055ce7c9.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Zach Baron","artist":"Earthride","title":"Vampire Circus","text":" Rumor has it, Leviathan singer Wrest has coined a term \"Nigel hipster,\" nigel for short to describe the metal carpetbaggers who fill out the ranks at Southern Lord shows. One thing metal is typically not, whether black, death, doom, drone, or otherwise, is ironic; cutoff tshirts and unwashed longhair on good lookin' Brooklynites qualifies, which is why Nachtmystium vocalist Azentrius was giving it to the good folks at Northsix before SunnO))) took the stage back in December. That said, I saw a reunited Grief play to about 25 people in the Knit basement that same fall, and when Earthride gets back to New York, figure something similar. Reason being: Earthride have zero charisma, little charm, and almost no nonhessian hooks; this, oddly enough, I think puts them at metal's new (old) nonavant frontier. Earthride certainly have the pedigree for it singer Dave Sherman did time in the wellliked Maryland doom outfit Spirit Caravan, and Vampire Circus was mostly recorded by Mike Dean, of the legendary Corrosion of Conformity and Probot. Neither aggressively slow nor aggressively fast, Earthride does a weedburning, midtempo cheesy riffs and lyrics thing; actually, what it really is, is rock and roll. \"PURE MARYLAND DOOM FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF MUSIC,\" as the slogan goes, and you might laugh at the whiskey vocals and 4/4 open snares and bluesed solos. Me though, I still like \"Dirtnap\": \"There's no solace for the ignorance of man/ There's no politicians gonna tell me where I stand/ Fuck no,\" even if I'm pretty sure that \"skin the cat\" also appears as lyric, rhymed, gulp, with \"Dirt. Nap.\" That song unfolds loose barrock soloed notes after tight repetitive chordings; to this, I play air guitar. Dave Sherman sounds (a lot) like Lemmy; the closer here is called \"Swamp Witch\", which has vocoder FX and organs courtesy of Clutch (gulp) keyboardist Mike Schauer. I'd be ironically laughing (or am, sort of) if I wasn't lifted on \"Vampire Circus\"'s lippursing doomy forecasts about the \"nature of an endless beast.\" The absurdly limitededition records doomish metal specializes in (free record reviews for that Noothgrush/Sloth split!) suggest that these dudes are not always out for numbers even if the contract does say Southern Lord and I'll bet Earthride doesn't spend much time envying High on Fire before they pass out on their swaggedup shag carpet. Vampire Circus never stops eying the prize, something you couldn't say about, say, the new Earth, so pick whichever one doesn't bore you. "}
