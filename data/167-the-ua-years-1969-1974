Maybe it's my German heritage rearing its ugly head, but I'll forever curse Faust for a song title so incredibly dumb, yet so easily appropriated to represent this movementinretrospect. \"What are you listening to?\" asks the cute girl sandwiched next to you on the bus. \"Amon Düül,\" you reply, intoning each umlaut with nativespeaker authenticity. \"Huh?\" \"It's Krautrock.\" End of discussion. Not that the alternatives are much better: \"musik kosmische?\" That just opens the way for even more deplorable Germanderived academispeak like \"gestalt,\" \"bildungsroman,\" or, uh, \"doppelgänger.\" I suppose the English translation \"cosmic music\" works as well as any; it's definitely music and it's sure as hell cosmic, but that's probably not likely to impress a potential date either, is it? Well, Purple Pyramid's attempt to sample Amon Düül's glory days with the United Artists label is similarly unimpressive, though not for lack of trying. The thought of boiling down eight albums' worth of the Düül's extraterrestrial slop into one singledisc showcase is a nightmarish idea in execution and import, but to the compilers' credit, The UA Years gives a small, sweet taste of each record, and guarantees a boost in sales for their other reissues (to anyone lucky enough to find them).Yeti the band's uncontested 1970 masterpiece draws the heaviest representation with four songs that showcase Amon Düül II as acidrock improvisers of the highest order. \"Archangel Thunderbird\" and \"Soap Shop Rock\" cast the group as something akin to a communal Black Sabbath, turning sludgy riffs and tremulous vocals into haphazard jewels, while \"Cerberus\" takes a more mystical approach, as the rambling opentuned acoustic jam fades into a phasedout electric hoedown without so much as a thread left hanging askew. If you remember one piece of information in this review, let it be that Yeti is Amon Düül II's crowning achievement. As far as the other records are concerned, this compilation provides several generous points of entry for even the most timid consumers. 1973's Wolf City comes in a close second to Yeti, thanks to the way their quintessential hippieprog exploration \"Wie der Wind am Ende Einer Strasse\" plays gentle contrast to the cosmic grandiosity of \"Surrounded by the Stars\" and the consciousnessrattling voices that float around the mix of Wolf City's title track. The tracks from 1972's Live in London stack the deck further: \"Race from Here to Your Ears\" is a fullout rock avalanche dusted with synth gurgles and violin slashes, while \"Improvisations\" rocks an outlandish drone that erupts into a Lennonesque choogle, complete with Renate KnaupKrötenschwanz's best Yokoinabag impersonation. But the most massive hurdle to overcome while listening to this disc and the reason that it's not at all recommendable to anyone already familiar with Amon Düül is the rampant excerpting of longer tracks to make room for a wider view of their work. Because once you've acquired a predilection for the band's sidelong trips to the outer limits, the bits and pieces on display here are hard to digest. Hearing them in this misaligned context also shows how dated some of this stuff can be, especially the straightouttaSpinal Tap \"Deutsch Népal\" and its medieval German voiceover; if you can't picture the band dancing around a miniature Stonehenge while playing this one, then I'll see you at the Renaissance Faire (sike!). Despite its shortcomings, I can't stress enough that The UA Years is an admirably assembled introduction to one of the most stylistically restless bands under the Krautrock banner. It's just that, personally, when the cosmic egg finally does crack, I expect to see the entire universe not a handful of stars and dust. "}
