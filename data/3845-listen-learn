{"label":" Ninja Tune","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/3805/homepage_large.e71b9608.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Mark Martelli","artist":"Hexstatic","title":"Listen & Learn","text":" Right now, I'm lying on my stomach on a dusty blue carpet, sniffing at my record crates like The Naked Chef whipped them up just for me (\\x93it's got a sort of, of, sort of luffly spicy flavah. It's top, innit?\\x94); touch typing instructional records snuggle up against Hancock and Wonder, lean lazily on acapella 12inches by Salt x92 Peppa and the soundtrack to Willy Wonka. There is no limit to the unexpected juxtapositions to be found in the dollar bin of basement record shops, a sprawling garden of fresh and waxy ingredients. Ringwear be damned. Hexstatic seem to understand this. Usually the A/V specialists of Ninja Tune's Muppetjazz empire, Listen and Learn is their contribution to the Solid Steel mix series, an excursion that is equal parts label sampler/primer and cratedigger's purging session. Pitting their taste for relaxed electronica against vintage vinyl cuts and oftsampled breaks, Hexstatic are at their most playful and least inhibited, a throwback to the energetic days of Funkjazzical Tricknology and DJ Food's Jazz Brakes series. Everything gets thrown on the wheels of steel (and in some cases, the CD mixer), licked and glued to the forehead of Ike and Tina Turner's \\x93Funky Mule\\x94, stapled to the spacey buttocks of \\x93Aquarius\\x94 by Boards of Canada (one of their best); the interludes are crammed so full of sound bites Charlie Brown, Queen, Rock the Houseera Will Smith, Twisted Sister and Boogie Nights in the space of 45 seconds on \\x93Solid Steel Rock School\\x94 it's like a vinyl trainspotter's lonely wet dream, a perpetual flea market of sound. The mood is sedate and chilled throughout. Only occasionally do Hexstatic break a sweat and drop an uptempo beat like the accelerated funk and bass edit of \\x93Mr. Scruff's Ninja Tune Megamix\\x94 that crops up early on, sneaking it into bed with a tasty loop of Dawn Penx92s \\x93No No No\\x94 before the mix settles into its creamy funk midsection. It's a nice exhibition of restraint, adding just enough adrenaline (and porno samples, natch) to keep things moving smoothly. This contrast brings out the hazy sunshine in slow burners such as \\x93Easy Thing To Do\\x94, an indelible vocal track by Shirley Bassey that unravels sweetly until the scratchfest \\x93Daily Intake\\x94 steals the ball and runs with it into the old school hiphop end zone, postpartying to Young MC's \\x93Know How\\x94.Listen and Learn never really falters or hits a rough spot, although the inclusion of \\x93The Message\\x94 suggests a lack of inspiration, a predictable choice that nevertheless melds well with its freewheeling leadin, the very alliterative \\x93Solid Steel Scratch School\\x94 interlude. But it's not a mix to remember either, more a tasty party snack than anything else, delicious and cheesy and without much resonance. Hexstatic probably wox92t stress on this point too much; their game plan is to get the asses shaking, the drunks jumpix92, the feet tapping. If the CD could put a lampshade on its head and grab your girlfriend's ass, it probably would: they're aiming for a thinking max92s spring break essential, and they achieve that with Listen and Learn.
