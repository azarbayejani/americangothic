His primary band, Portishead, are notorious for taking an average of seven years between albums to acheive that perfect shade of noir. But each of the items in Barrow's bursting dossier of extracurricular assignments bears his meticulous touch. When he feels like making a hiphop record, he assembles one with 41 tracks and 30plus guest MCs. When he wants to sign a rock band to his Invada imprint, he goes for one built from a Paul’s Boutiquelevel of samplebased bricolage. When he scores a production gig for an NMEendorsed group of garagepunk pinups, he refashions them as widescreenvisioned psychedelic goths. And when he's in the mood to hear some Krautrock, rather than just dust off his wellworn copy of Tago Mago, he makes a BEAK> record. Krautrock, of course, has become as much of a default mode for experimental indie bands as the blues was for a previous generation of classicrockers. And in BEAK>'s case, the sonic resemblances to their 70s forbears can be, well, unCanny: even more so than the band's selftitled 2009 debut, >> sounds like it was recorded inside of Jaki Liebezeit's kick drum, all hypnobass throb, heavy percussive grooves, and buzzing analog synths. Krautrock is synonymous with a certain rhythmic precision and propulsion, but BEAK> don't just lock into a motorik beat and activate the cruise control. Rather, they see the music as part of a broader continuum, digging up its roots in the frazzled psychedelia of Syd Barrettera Pink Floyd, funk, and musique concrete, while emphasizing its influence on everything from electro and postpunk to Italian horrormovie soundtracks and stonermetal. As the lone keystroke difference between the first and second album titles suggest, this is a band that progresses in increments. BEAK>> retains the same eerie, claustrophobic atmosphere as its predecessor after all, its opening track is a sludgy, slowmotion swirl of policesiren effects called \"The Gaol\" and the ominously indecipherable vocals sound like they were recorded by the mouthless dummies seen in their press shots. But the new album also boasts a brisker pace spurred by the excitable synthrock thrust of \"Yatton\" and \"Elevator\", and the mushroomheady funk of \"Spinning Top\" tauter arrangements, and a more purposeful sequence: All roads lead to side two's sevenminute colossus \"Wulfstan II\", an Earthquaking jolt of brownacid rock whose unrelenting, fuzzbomb stomp is periodically interrupted by welltimed, organguided breakdowns, only to reemerge more nasty and unforgiving than before. (Though its Richterscale reading is almost matched by the slowcreeping closer \"Kidney\", which begins as a Young Marble Giants murmur before erupting into a Slintian roar.) Barrow recently quipped to Rolling Stone that it could be another \"fucking 10 years\" before we see a new Portishead record; whether he was joking or not, the wait will feel a little less interminable so long as this band continues to put their best > forward.
