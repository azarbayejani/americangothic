I've been going through a period of longdreaded nostalgia lately, listening to cassettes I made as far back as before I was teenager, and it's amazing to realize that I still know every word to pop songs I'd forgotten about for more than a decade and how their very familiarity can make them sound more inviting. No, I don't remember when rock was young, but I can see how Elton John's \"Crocodile Rock\" would've charmed 1970s listeners not only for its own sake, but also for the reminiscences its 50sstyle piano pop sound and references would've evoked. On the sophomore album by Leeds, UK, indiepoppers the Lodger, life is often sweet, but the memories are usually sweeter.Life Is Sweet reveals a wistful, bouncy threepiece not just aware of their pop lineage, but also appropriately hopeful about their place in the current pecking order. The album's best song (by far) wonders whether the present moment will be tomorrow's \"The Good Old Days\", and earns itself a spot in the ol' brain tissue by bringing refreshing, hookfilled simplicity to the Orange Juice blend of disco and sensitive janglepop. Much as Okkervil River sing of the travails of \"a midlevel band,\" the Lucksmithslike \"A Hero's Welcome\" undercuts \"The Good Old Days\" with a selfdeprecating recognition that hoping your genius will be recognized \"is a hopeless and pointless charade.\" Opener \"My Finest Hour\" is lightweight by comparison, but it's easy to imagine the charms it might have onstage one fine hour in a roomful of likeminded tweepop fans.The good old days were never as good as we remember them, though. Recalling teenage thrills on the slower \"Falling Down\", singer/guitarist Ben Siddall chides, \"You're a cruel, cruel girl,\" only at the end adding, \"But you're mine.\" On the flute and stringladen \"Honey\", he compares this anguish to music: \"Singing another kind of song/ Finding new hooks to hang upon/ Why are you always hurting me, honey?\" One track after bemoaning having \"Nothing Left (to Say)\" on the most Sound of Young Scotlandlike song on the album, Siddall turns around and asks, \"Is there something new that I could bring to the conversation?\"That one doesn't have much to add, no, what with its painfully forgettable chorus of \"I don't want to fall in love/ I just want to rise above,\" but the sprightly \"A Year Since That Summer\" (\"I was your other,\" Siddall recalls) or the weatherobsessed melancholy of \"Running Low\" could someday fill today's Voxtrot or Vampire Weekend fans with bittersweet nostalgia. \"So it goes/ You have one last throw of the dice,\" goes the maudlin, waltzing finale, \"Famous Last Words\". At least \"The Good Old Days\" will always be there, in 1's and 0's or analog grooves pleasantly imperfect sound forever for our imperfect memories. "}
