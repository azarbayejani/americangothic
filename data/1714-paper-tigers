Their second U.S. release, 2003's 39 Minutes of Bliss (in an Otherwise Meaningless World), was among the most assiduous Nuggets rips of the neugarage years, pillaging equal parts Sonics, 13th Floor Elevators, and ? and the Mysterians. To me (if not a certain website's archives), the strength of a few goofy, clever and undeniably catchy tracks \"Jerk It Out\", \"Sort It Out\", \"Let's Go Parking Baby\" all but made up for the disc's unevenness. Authenticity? Dudes, Jack White never practiced in an honesttogoodness Kennedyera car hole, either. Now the Swedes formerly known as 12 Caesars and Caesars Palace are back just in time to cash in on Apple's embrace of \"Jerk It Out\" for the company's ubiquitous iPod commercials. Aside from that track, which recurs on Paper Tigers as a bloated remix, the band's 1960s fascination seems to have given way to a 70s powerpop fetish. Bits of Who bombast do seep into opener \"Spirit\", but fluffy jingles like \"May the Rain\" and \"Out There\" sound more like deservedly forgotten Romantics cuts. Alas, the powerpop Caesars aren't as fun as the garagerock Caesars; rather than proclaiming a ludicrous desire to \"sniff glue/ 'Cause I can't get over you,\" they plunge into hackneyed lyricsbynumbers about \"rivers of salty tears\" and not being able to \"go on without you\" even though \"my heart is strong.\" Again, the band's backwardlooking aesthetic doesn't bother me. But the bland, overproduced nothings of the Caesars' latest like those of fellow newfound powerpoppers Tegan and Sara are cause for consternation. One of Paper Tigers' many whopping clich√©s, \"It's Not the Fall That Hurts\", is still catchy enough to match the stupid fun of 39 Minutes' best moments. But the rest of the album is merely a blur of unimaginative song fragments layered with heavy echo and the remnants of the band's original guitar fuzz. I liked it better when they sounded like Smashmouth. Wait, did I say \"triply\"? I meant Tripoli. Nah, just kidding, here's the kicker: Even as the Caesars' bestknown song is an icon of the iPod revolution, their new album is a throwback to the very business model that spawned Napster and its descendants. Yes: Like the multiplatinum '90s abominations that turned the biggest music lovers into the industry's most wanted, Paper Tigers is one or two decent singles surrounded by a bunch of mediocreorworse filler. Now that's retro. "}
