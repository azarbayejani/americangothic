Ward","title":"Transfiguration of Vincent","text":" Some time in 2035, I'm going to pull this album out, and it's going to sound just as good as it does now. There's something running through it that broadcasts timelessness and defies genre constraints quite a feat, considering how M. Ward's previous outings had pegged him as a modernday altcountry troubadour, tied to tradition despite promise that suggested he might one day transcend its confines. For Transfiguration of Vincent, M. Ward has invited collaborators who bring full flesh to his music, landing at the nexus of melodydrenched pop, Delta blues, Wall of Sound glow, ragtime, Appalachian folk, and about a halfdozen other styles. With this album, Ward moves onto the same block as Sparklehorse, Pinetop Seven, Calexico, Lambchop, and a host of other artists who draw from backwoods phantasmagoria and disparate genres. Over the past year or so, I've been really drawn into the world that musicians like Ward inhabit. There's a sort of spiritual gravity to music that exists in the cracks between genres and passing movements, and because it can mixandmatch the entire history of music, it's an aesthetic that's unlikely to run short of ideas any time soon. This album manages to cross a great deal of terrain without actually feeling eclectic there are too many elements working in concert with each other for true stylistic shifts to occur even while containing variety in spades. It doesn't hurt matters that Ward's singing and writing has developed into something truly special and unique. On the swinging flamenco blues number \"Sad, Sad Song\", Ward's voice is an impossible blend of gravel and silk as he croons, \"I went to my momma/ I said momma, please/ What do you do when your true love leaves?/ She said the hardest thing in the world to do/ Is to find somebody who believes in you.\" They may be an acquired taste for some, but Ward's pipes are a perfect fit for his songs, moving through the decades with the same ease as his music, and taking on music hall boisterousness and bluesy weariness by turns, always full of soul. On the instrumental \"Duet for Guitars #3\", Ward takes things to the back porch for a brilliant, kinetic moment of levity, but otherwise, Transfiguration of Vincent is laden with heavy emotions and musings on death, loss and violence. \"Helicopter\" whirs with energy, bounding on a steady rhythm, Ward expounding on some sort of fantasy about rescuing innocents from the violence of the world. Through the nostalgic haze of \"Outta My Head\", amidst fluttering organs and synths, Ward sings, \"A playful little kitten/ Met a playful little bird/ And then off with its head/ Off with its head/ Oh my.\" And his rough falsetto pulls all the emotion from the chorus of \"Undertaker\", where, over an ornate bed of acoustic guitar, theremin and muffled violin, he moans, \"If you're gonna leave/ You better call the undertaker/ Take me under, undertaker/ Take me home.\" There are moments on Transfiguration of Vincent for which words fail particularly the cover of David Bowie's \"Let's Dance\", where Ward's lowkey, acoustic delivery reveals a surprisingly emotional, fragile piece and while that may be an extremely uncomfortable position for a music reviewer, for a listener, it's the best place you could possibly be. I would say \"enjoy it while it lasts,\" but you've got all the time in the world. "}
