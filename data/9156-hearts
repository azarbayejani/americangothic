{"label":" Absolutely Kosher","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/8998/homepage_large.9ace75df.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"The Court & Spark","title":"Hearts","text":" Whatever path the Court & Spark frontman M.C. Taylor was on has taken a turn for the worse. Previous albums from the band found it mining the usual No Depression touchstones for fresh blood, and gradually mixing that extract with whatever's at hand. More often than not , the group succeeded regardless of how far they decided to stray from the source text. With Hearts, however, the confident, and blissedout vibe of their previous work gives way to a confused burntout haze where the group's many influences collide and smear. It kicks off (or, more fittingly, rolls over) with \"Let's Get High\", a meandering stumble of a song that lives up to every possible negative stereotype a track with such a title can engender. After an atmospheric introductory minute, the track leads with stilted drumming and delaypedaled guitar underpinning Taylor's listless singing. His call to pass the dutchie, peppered with references to the Mercy Seat and getting turned on and swimming with his lady friend (\"you have beautiful fins\"), paint him as a narcoleptic Jim Morrison. The betweenverse interludes, featuring some tasteful slide guitar, almost rights the ship, but then the actual song, wearing a COLLEGE sweatshirt, comes back in and spills beer all over the couch. Despite some moments that highlight the band's strengths, the album never recovers from this initial misstep. Some of the faux pas are songlong, like \"Capaldi\", an attempt to squeeze some Crazy Horse jam into an Elmer's Glue bottle. Some of the lowpoints are just odd moments and decisions that occur midsong, like the switch from the sweet lowdown shuffle of the first half of \"High Life\" to some illconceived raveup outro, or the use of corny voice distortion during the chorus of \"Ballad of Horselover Fat\". And if whatever the group's using to get high inspired them to insert synth trumpets in the middle of \"Smoke Signals\", their dealer should get a kick in the balls.  It's a shame, too, because when this album get its genresplicing shit together, it's pretty nice. The instrumental \"Milk White Flag\" (and its tapelooped reprisal, \"Gatesnakes\") offer a brief but enjoyable melodic shimmer. Meanwhile, fullblown tracks like the laidback \"We Were All Uptown Rulers\" and the playful \"Your Mother Was The Lightning\" provide a more appealing backdrop for Taylor's laconic vocal and lyrical stylings. Moments like this get lost amidst the rest of the album, however, leading to a record that's trying too hard to be everything all at once. "}
