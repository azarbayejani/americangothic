Take the \"Collage of Digital Passion\": This German trio's cutup piece could briefly cause a few eyes to blink at the hifi during a cocktail party or soothe a heartbroken and Nyquildrunk soul bathed in bedroom TV glare. The \"passion\" comes from the snippets of uttered \"love\" samples that flicker in the rhythm of a bored man's remote control; a loop of a crushedvelvet R&B; ladykiller carries the piece with a \"love\" that sings to every straggler who comes in the lounge for bitters. The sauntering microfunkiness of it all could remind one of a dazed Prefuse 73 or, for the obscurists, the aciddamaged collage of the United States of America's \"The American Way of Love\". Yet, the liner notes of Lost Recordings inform us that the \"Digital Passion\" was actually a trailer soundtrack for a special on \"sexuality and romance in digital postmodernism\" on the science TV show called \"Adventure Research\". My BS detector rings a happy song when the notes then mentioned the track had an \"aphrodisiac effect\" that apparently mutated the show's recording session into something \"akin to a sexual orgy.\" Unfortunately, the Exposures' \"secret\" incident was kept in the studio vault, so we get a \"toned down\" version of what happened through our stereos or a \"vague idea of the composition's true impact.\" Fair enough. What this has to do with deconstructed semantics, image, and power or whatever this week's definition of postmodernism is I'll get back to you on that when there is time and money. The Exposures are best remembered for being credited as a \"fictitious backing band\" on microhouse snake charmer Jan Jelinek's 2003 sleeper, La Nouvelle Pauverte. Whether Jelinek saved or robbed them is unclear: Conflicting reports tell us that he shined the light on these 25plus year veterans by inviting them to perform on that record, while the liner notes on the group's Lost Recordings which compiles their obscure pieces from the past four years\\xD1claim Jelinek sampled their shimmering wahwah guitar without permission for his \"Ifs ands & Buts\". Hell, judging by the songs here, The Exposures could really be Jelinek himself in bboy drag. Confusion aside, Scott \"Prefuse 73/Savath + Savlas/Delarosa and Asaora/Piano Overlord\" Herren is giving the Exposures their dues through his Eastern Development label. The German trio of M. Cretu, N. Gratin, and O. Grouton originally came out of an experiment in German television sometime in the late 70s. A station tried to amuse viewers with short movies between shows, instead of the usual commercial filler. They eventually spent the next two decades soundtracking films and TV shows. The results are instrumentals that take a good, digestible jazzhop idea and loop it for three minutes with a few chord progressions to deliver the goods before they expire. The best is \"Post Crossings\", with its octopuslimbed synth riff that sounds mechanical yet oddly lyrical. \"A Machine Under Influence\" (apparently recorded live at a Volkswagen plant) is nearly as strong with its clovesmoked jazz that walks in a circle as a UFO toy beeper grows in volume and madness before cutting off. \"Sake Rock\" sounds like a distant subway ring that duets with a guitarist struggling to hit the right notes with it, while \"The Knack\" (done for a documentary about some guy who pedalboated across the Atlantic) has a swank jazz strut that breaks its bones with every added note and snap of the sampler. \"Das Freundliche Rocksichord\" and \"Ein Lied für Frau ThyssenHenne\" are both Polaroid snapshots of cool jazz and bossa nova grooves all bathed in a weariness aged with time and listlessness. Overall, there are so many peculiar sounds and historical contexts in Lost Recordings that a cult could very well arise around the Exposures. Yet, something tells me that there is a man behind the curtain that could surprise or disappoint many if it was opened. I mean, \"Post Crossings\" apparently grooved a TV exposé on cycle racing that sparked public outrage, a moment that the liner notes acclaim is the handiwork of \"sensational journalism, accompanied by an equally sensational band.\" Do you hear a detector ringing?
