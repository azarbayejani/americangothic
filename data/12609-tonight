The Glaswegian band issued its sophomore effort You Could Have It So Much Better some 18 months after its 2004 selftitled debut a narrow window considering that first record yielded three top 10 UK singles, a Mercury Prize, and a steady touring itinerary that saw them ascend from clubs to concert halls to the Grammys. But the quick turnaround and life on the road didn't affect the quality of the material so much as the band's performance of it sounding brawnier and brasher than on their debut, Franz Ferdinand ripped through the album's 13 songs.Â  Franz Ferdinand must've therefore been happy to sit out the past three years. In the time since Franz released their last album, their American contemporaries the Killers have already gone Springsteen and then swung back to their synthpop roots, while nextgeneration UK upstarts like the Arctic Monkeys have weathered their own cycle of hyperbole, hibernation, and orchestral side projects. During that time, Franz Ferdinand first seemed poised to reemerge as the biggest pop band in the UK having initially tapped Girls Aloud guru Brian Higgins (Xenomania) to produce their third album or the most commercially suicidal, eventually parting ways with Higgins and indulging in extended studio jams, electronic experiments, and deconstructed, Martin Hannettlike recording techniques (complete with tales of using human bones for percussion).In his review of You Could Have It So Much Better, Pitchfork's Nitsuh Abebe praised Franz Ferdinand for making albums that played like compilations of discrete but equally great singles, refreshingly bereft of the conceptual heft that marked the band's indierock peers at the time. Here the group dial that back from the start: \"Ulysses\" is less immediately striking than the band's previous headlining singles, as well as more lean and mechanistic. But it ably asserts Tonight's slowburn methodology: If that \"la la la\" chorus sounds unremarkable at first, by the third round, it's unstoppable.Instead, Tonight's patient pacing supports Franz singer Alex Kapranos' claims that these tracks share a nocturnal theme, reinforced by a gradually arced dusktodawn sequence, a wandering spirit, and surprises that spring out of the shadows: \"Send Him Away\" comes on as a cool snapalong Sly Stone strut before intensifying into an unlikely but effective Afropsychfunk jam; \"Bite Hard\" is a piano ballad reborn as a thickheeled glamrock gallop; the slomodisco group chant \"What You Came For\" explodes into roadhousemetal thrashing. But seeing as many of these arrangements were extracted from improvised jams, the shifts rarely feel forced, sounding more like the inevitable climaxes to Kapranos' seedy, increasingly desperate, clubcrawling narratives.It's only on Tonight's wouldbe epic \"Lucid Dreams\" that the album's exploratory approach works against the band's pop instincts. Appearing in a considerably different, elongated eightminute version than the one that debuted on the band's website last fall, the song is now outfitted with a rearranged, sloweddown chorus that makes it stumble where it should soar. But if the extended fade out feels overlong and anticlimactic on its own terms, in the context of Tonight it provides an effective, slatecleaning setup for the album's two sweetly serene closers: spaceage bachelorpad lullaby \"Dream Again\" and a solo acoustictroubador turn from Kapranos on \"Katherine Kiss Me\".More so than stoking the band's current commercial prospects, Tonight is an exciting record for what it could potentially spell for Franz Ferdinand's future from here, you could just as easily imagine the band further exploring electrohouse productions, or stripping their sound down and making a folk record, or delving into tropical laptoptronic pop. Or, if you just want them to keep rewriting \"Take Me Out\", well, hey, they can do that too see: \"No You Girls\", a standardissue but still irresistible discofloor stomper that imagines Bowie rerecording \"Oh You Pretty Things\" for Scary Monsters (and which recently assumed its natural habitat in an episode of \"Gossip Girl). As the band that provided the exclamation point to the postpunk revival of the early 00s, there was good reason to question Franz Ferdinand's current standing in the pop world, now that that trend is on the wane. However, as it turns out, their return is perfectly timed to remind us that, in a world where UK rock is so uninspired the Brits were forced to make superstars out of Kings of Leon, you really can have it so much better.
