{"label":" Dead Oceans","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/17522/homepage_large.16473abe.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amanda Petrusich","artist":"Bowerbirds","title":"The Clearing","text":" For most folks, good oldfashioned death is an awfully daunting concept to unpack. But it makes sense that Bowerbirds, a North Carolina duo known for its soft and folksy paeans to nature, would reckon frankly with The End on The Clearing: Nowhere else is death quite as palpable sensible, even as the garden, the forest, the backyard. \"Oh, my dear friend, everything falls to death,\" Phil Moore sings on the opening track. \"We tuck the darkness in.\" Bowerbirds' first two LPs 2007's Hymns for a Dark Horse and 2009's Upper Air were relatively spare productions, but The Clearing is broad and ambitious, featuring more (and richer) instrumentation and unprecedented studio gleam. In the three years since Upper Air, Moore and girlfriend/bandmate Beth Tacular have grappled with a spate of challenges Tacular fell ill (then recovered), they broke up, they got back together, they rescued and adopted a dog (the same one they accidentally walloped with their tour van), they handbuilt a little cabin in the woods (\"The logs we peeled and stacked in a ring/ And then we crowned it, our tiny house, with tin\"). Plenty of things broke; a few got fixed. All those ends and beginnings ultimately became creative fodder, and The Clearing is imbued with a kind of stubborn tenuousness: Here we are, still holding on, waiting for the thaw. \"There's a hope that we have what we need,\" Moore and Tacular harmonize on \"Stitch the Hem\", and it seems, just then, like the only hope worth having. Bowerbirds have mined this space before, and most of the lyrical memes here nature, alienation, love are familiar. Nearly every track references the earth in one way or another: the soil, the stars, the sea, the long winter. But erstwhile fans might be a little spooked by the record's production.Â The Clearing was mostly recorded at April Base, Bon Iver's Wisconsin studiohouseretreat, with Brian Joseph (who engineered Bon Iver), and includes bountiful layers and plenty of moving parts (violin, cello, trombone, clarinet, organ, vibraphone, to start).  The Clearing is deliberately polished for a folk record, but what it lacks in scrappiness it makes up for in its precise, artful construction. Just like Moore and Tacular's home in the forest, The Clearing feels lovingly erected, fashioned bit by bit. Making something slotting different parts together, building a whole from disparate elements is a reasonable way to grapple with all the ancient, exhausting burdens of new adulthood: to make sense of a tough year. Moore stretches his vocals in places, pushing into an upper register that conveys a welcome sense of desperation (and a necessary contrast to the album's otherwise shiny surfaces). It's not surprising that a record preoccupied with life cycles would contain at least one origin story, and \"Brave World\" lifts a few key lines \"My name, it means nothing/ My age it means less/ The country I come from is called the Midwest\" from Dylan's antiwar anthem \"With God on Our Side\", but it's less about fighting than the places we come from. Over nervous, tapping percussion, Moore lays it out, his voice rising: \"I'm dust and you're dust and we're honest.\" For all its dark moments, The Clearing is ultimately hopeful. \"Now We Hurry On\", the closing track, echoes a lyric from \"In Our Talons\", the standout moment from Bowerbirds' debut. \"No, you're not alone,\" Moore promises. There's the sun and the sparrows and the red dirt path, there's \"me and my true love.\" Plenty, in other words, to find solace in. "}
