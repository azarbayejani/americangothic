{"label":" Daptone","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/4304/homepage_large.dc73f9bb.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Cameron Macdonald","artist":"Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings","title":"Naturally","text":" While the second grade assemblies chant the first two verses of \"This Land Is Your Land\" in the multipurpose rooms of elementary schools from suburbia to the innercities, Sharon Jones struts across the virgin American land and into the welfare office with Woody Guthrie in arm. The DapKings the ace house band for Brooklyn heavyfunk revivalist label Daptone concocts a heavyfunk groove that saunters each step, twists in place, and then glides forward to onlookers' disbelief. Sitting in the office of Government Love is David Guy's trumpet that jitters in trying to keep a straight face, while saxmen Neal Sugarman and Otis Youngblood nudge his ribs. Tradition dictates every patriot must sing that song with a cornfed drawl to demonstrate he or she is thankful of the homestead lands that Uncle Sam gave away to his or her grandpappy, but Jones sings it like she's been promised everything and got nothing. In Aretha's \"don't you know?\" tone, she shoots each lyric as if in a cheatin' lover's ear. And then comes the verses erased in so many school songbooks: \"In the squares of the city/ In the shadow of the steeple/ Near the welfare office/ I see my people/ And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'/ If this land's still made for you and me.\" Jones' second album, Naturally, is a testament to how much was lost in R&B; over the past decade. Her band's music and album covers may seem arcane if not retro, but there is an undeniable substance in a tradition bled dry from so many Boyz II Men, Mariah, and Babyface records. Instead of autopiloted rimshots and faint piano melodies of bastardized Barry White soul, the DapKings deliver highfiber soul that recalls the best of the JB's, the Meters and countless garage bands who heard James Brown's call and recorded oneoff 45s. Nary a gutbucket beat, horn blast, or chickenscratched and honeycombed guitar riff are wasted; almost every melody and its haunting through hours both sleeping and awake, clicks. \"How Do I Let a Good Man Down?\" and \"Your Thing Is a Drag\" hiccups a groove that is nearly up there with the JB's classic trance, \"Give Me Some More\", as Jones belts out a melancholy that strikes between the eyes. Her songs mainly dwell on the \"he loves me/he loves me not\" premise that are so well sung that they evade cliche. \"My Man Is a Mean Man\" is a jaunt that runs from and then smacks up the wifebeater in question, while \"How Long Do I Have to Wait for You\" is a hit of sunshine that hypnotizes a noisenik like me. \"Believe me when I tell you/ I got the kind of love, baby/ That's going to make you higher than what you're dreaming of,\" she sings in the enchantment under the sea ballad, \"You're Gonna Get It\". This was made for you and me. "}
