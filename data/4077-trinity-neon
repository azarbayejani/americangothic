There was already a frighteningly diverse school of simultaneous evolutions happening in the late 60s, from the protometal of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, to the early progressive rock of Yes, Genesis and King Crimson, to intricate folk of Pentangle and the Fairport Convention, to the budding indiepop of David Bowie and Marc Bolan, to experimental, jazzdriven outfits like Canterbury's Soft Machine. At the dawn of the 70s, all these strands of rock and beyond were set adrift to follow their own paths, never to meet again (though musicians would often infiltrate one camp or another, blurring the lines of \\x93genre\\x94). This period, roughly 1968 to 1971, is almost a forgotten era in British rock unless you've closely followed one or more of the above artists, in which case it starts to look like a classic era. Stereolab's Simon Johns and his band Imitation Electric Piano haven't forgotten those years. Working with multiinstrumentalist Lee Adams, drummer Ashley Marlowe, bassist Andrew Blake and a few others, Johns' band follows a similar trajectory as a few bands mentioned above, most notably the wry progressive psyche of early Soft Machine and other likeminded bands such as National Health. The band also shares quite a few similarities with Stereolab, especially in their lapses into motorik and postrock pulsating drive, and their love of vintage instrumentation (imitation electric piano ain't just a band name). Johns wrote or cowrote all of the music here, and handles all lead vocals (appearing on about half of the record). His understated baritone is a nice foil for the extended pieces, though, like recent Stereolab, the band has a tendency to veer into the background. Though Johns does sing on several tracks, Trinity Neon seems more like a sequence of (sometimes lengthy) instrumental impressions, encouraging listeners to wander in and out of the music. \\x93The Khartoum Venus\\x94 begins as a minorkey funk vamp, led by muted trumpet and the kind of spidery organ lick that hasn't been popular since Rod Argent bought his first Hammond. This segues into a deft, hard trance rock that sounds obviously similar to Stereolab. Likewise, \\x93Don't Tell Me I'm Wrong (But You Are)\\x94 is reminiscent of Cobra and Phases  period 'Lab with its loungey take on jazzrock, right down to the busy drumming and harpsichord touches. \\x93Chronicle of a Spirit Foretold\\x94 steps a bit further out, and though it's hardly avantgarde, does blend its mellotron tones and oddmetered, syncopated rhythms in a way more akin to 70s psycheprog than 90s postrock. The liveliest moments on the record occur on \\x93Theme for an Imitation Electric Piano\\x94, which features Johns \\x93rockin' and rollin'\\x94 his way through prime pep. The jamband ending is a bit unexpected who knew these guys were such guitar heroes? but it's nice to hear them step out of their pristine arrangements every now and then. The opener \\x93Gin Lane\\x94 begins as a gentle pop lilt, with Johns lamenting that he'll \\x93never see you, or hear you again.\" The pace picks up, but the song never seems overly fussy one of Imitation Electric Piano's strengths is that they're able to make fairly complex things sounds simple. Even the full ensemble counterpoint in the middle seems perfectly natural. If you're one of those not completely perturbed at the last few Stereolab records, there is a good chance you'll find something of interest on Trinity Neon. Proximity aside, the record is a virtual goldmine for laidback British jazzrock, though don't go expecting anything terribly \\x93out\": it's a uniformly pleasant record, and that's probably the best and worst I can say about it. If Johns' reference to Robert Wyatt in the liner notes causes a spike in \\x93Moon In June\\x94 downloads, I'd call it a resounding success. "}
