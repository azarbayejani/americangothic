{"label":" self-released","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/18684/homepage_large.d69cc161.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Carrie Battan","artist":"Katy B","title":"Danger EP","text":" The opening track on UK pop talent Katy B's new EP, Danger, is called \"Aaliyah\". At this point we generally know what we're in for when mention is made of the late singer some haphazard reappropriation of a vocal track or Timbaland beat, the trademark baby coos of \"Are You That Somebody?\" buried behind layers of echo or slapped onto somone else's production. But Katy flips expectations here by creating a song that sounds nothing like an Aaliyah original, instead paying homage by making her the subject of the track's lyrics. \"Aaliyah, please this is green envy/ Why must you taunt me, girl?,\" she sings over a bass rhythm. Katy trades lines seamlessly with guest Jessie Ware, another UK breakout vocalist, crafting a lyrical love triangle that gazes at Aaliyah from a brand new angle. Together the singers take lowhanging fruit and make something complex from it. Ware joins a stacked lineup of collaborators on the foursong Danger EP that also includes producers Diplo, Jacques Greene, Geeneus, and Zinc, along with rappers Iggy Azalea and Wiley. Which could have very easily made for a crowded, linkbaitladen mess of an EP under another artist's jurisdiction (see: Charli XCX’s Super Ultra EP), but Katy B proves herself an excellent curator. Danger's a collective effort that's diverse but never motley, warm never weak, tough but never harsh, slick but never washed out. While Katy's the centerpiece of the release, she's also an expert chameleon who bends to accommodate her collaborators without sacrificing her vision of gentle UK bassbred club music. She invites them to see things her way. On paper, the easy weak link appears to be \"Light as a Feather\", which pairs Diplo's \"Set It Off\" beat with notorious Australian rap robodoll Iggy Azalea. It's a recipe for a capitalA annoying song, but Iggy makes what might be her least grating showing ever, adding a brief and subdued verse before passing the buck back to Katy. \"Show me your wild side/ I'll be your Vegas/ Don't hold back/ It's yours for the taking,\" she raps, just as Katy swoops in and cleverly lifts the word \"take\" for her own part. \"What does it take/ To make you feel/ To get you excited/ To see you smile?,\" she asks as the soft synth fizz percolates. As she did with On a Mission, Katy B uses the Danger EP to explore a softer, more forlorn aspect of nightlife, braiding the nuances of parties and relationships together. \"Yeah you passed my love to the lefthand side/ Smoked it right down to the roach/ So I might as well put it out,\" she sings on the slinky Jacques Greeneproduced ballad \"Danger\". She and Drake might get along well. But the message is clearest on Fridaynight anthem \"Got Paid\": \"Straight to the floor/ I let the beat mend my broken heart.\" Katy never sulks for long. Dropped out of the blue in the year's midDecember deadzone, Danger is another triumph of the EPlength release. Some of the year's best music Dum Dum Girls' End of Daze, TNGHT's selftitled debut, and Solange Knowles' new record True has been released in the brief, punchy form, and now we can add Danger to that list. In Katy's case, it serves several important purposes: It's a placeholder that reminds us of her existence and shows us she's established some exciting collaborative relationships since On a Mission. It gives us a sparkling peek into what she might have lined up for her scheduled fulllength next year. Most of all, it just makes us want to dance. "}
