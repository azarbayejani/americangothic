{"label":" Tigre Blanco","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/12996/homepage_large.66d42473.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"Minus the Bear","title":"Acoustics EP","text":" Minus the Bear have historically held the EP in the same esteem as the LP; not counting remix records, they've released EPs and LPs in equal numbers. Their new EP Acoustics, however, marks the first time they've treated that format as a stopgap between albums. As you may have guessed from the title, this is Minus the Bear unplugged, with one new song and six photocopies of old songs played essentially the same way as the originals with slightly different instruments.For some reason, the nonelectric policy doesn't seem to apply to the bass guitar, and I swear I'm hearing some electric piano on \"We Are Not a Football Team\", \"Pachuca Sunrise\", and \"Ice Monster\", though that could simply be very skillful layering of acoustic guitar harmonics these guys do have some chops, after all. The new song, \"Guns & Ammo\", sounds like, well, Minus the Bear without electric guitars and keyboards, and I don't mean that to sound dismissive. They're a distinctive band. But it's a track that only people who are already pretty big fans of the band need to hear, and the same can be said for the rest of this EP the electric versions of these songs are all more interesting than these acoustic ones.None of these tracks are outright misses granted, but the energy level feels low, and deamplifying the guitars doesn't have a huge effect because the band in its electric guise has never relied much on distortion of other effects that would significantly change the tone. One of the band's most memorable songs, \"Pachuco Sunrise\", loses the dancey bounce of its original chorus in favor of strumming and a fairly basic backbeat the rhythmic dynamism is definitely missed.\"Knights\", one of four songs originally from last year's Planet of Ice, retains nearly every proggy guitar flourish of its source, turning the stuttering CDskiplike instrumental hook into a little descending phrase, and it's likely fans will enjoy parsing out exactly what they did to make the rearrangement work. Everyone else can safely leave this EP, a digital release only available in physical form at the band's shows, alone. "}
