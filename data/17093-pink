Originally started in 2001, it had only released eight titles over the course of a decade, but 2011 would prove to be a busy year for Hebden. Rather than rest on the laurels and accolades for 2010's There Is Love in You, he released his entry in the acclaimed Fabriclive series, toured and DJed internationally, and then jumpstarted Text with two plain sleeve 12\"'s: \"Ego\"/\"Mirror\" was a Four Tet collaboration with dubstep demiurge Burial and some British bloke named Thom Yorke and \"Pinnacles\"/\"Ye Ye\" was a split single featuring Four Tet and Caribou's Dan Snaith (before he assumed his Daphni moniker). The former signified a decade's worth of British electronic musicrunning from Kid A through Four Tet and onto Burial while Four Tet's \"Pinnacles\" served a function similar to his 2008 EPÂ Ringer. After the loft jazzinspired Everything Ecstatic and a heady collaboration with noted jazz/soul/African/funk drummer Steve Reid that resulted in numerous drumlaptop improv albums and suggested that Hebden might never quite return to earth, Ringer reminded fans that Hebden has always kept an ear to the dancefloor. But whereas that EP reveled in 4/4 minimalyetplayful techno bangers, \"Pinnacles\" was a decidedly more ambitious affair, intermingling dubstep's wobble with an elegant McCoy Tyneresque piano line, Joe Meek guitar lick, and some lasers. Perhaps spurred by the \"Thom Yorke Bump,\" it triggered a year's worth of heady dance singles from Hebden, spanning three 12\"'s (with another credited to the moniker Percussions), all compiled now on Pink with an additional two unreleased tracks. \"Locked\" opens things and hearkens back to the Four Tet of old. A dusty, crackling drum break that would make bboys bob heads lopes around, but it soon abuts another machine pulse, suggesting an African polyrhythm about its downtempo pace. It's from this trickier rhythmic bed (with a substrata of bass frequencies) that Hebden builds up a wistful melody that evokes memories of his 2003 breakout album, Rounds. The unreleased \"Lion\" follows, suggesting both the earliest instances of late80s tribal house as well as au courant UK bass music, the primitive yips, clipped kalimba line and speedy metabolism of the snare underpinned by a menacing drone. When the \"Jupiters\" single dropped earlier this year, I was a tad underwhelmed as the overture while stately and lovely seemed to do little for the side. Yet it works better in the context of Pink, providing a beatless interlude before dropping us into Four Tet's most bassheavy and adventurous track to date, nodding to Autechre at their crunchiest and 2step at its twitchiest. It's followed by its standout flipside, \"Ocoras\", wherein Hebden takes what could be a skipping CD of organ music and some of Pantha du Prince's struckbell tones and minces them finely before sprinkling atop some propulsive minimal techno. A skittering hihat rather than harps power \"128 Harps\" and again evokes the \"idyllictronica\" tag once affixed to Four Tet's particular strain of electronic music. \"Pyramid\", originally the Bside for \"Locked\", has a Model 500worthy bassline and Hebden again deploys a voice (uttering \"I remember how you walked away\") in much the same manner as he did on \"Love Cry\". Those components alone would make this a standout track, but he again pushes at such parameters and at around the four minute mark, a shimmering metallophone melody worthy of Steve Reich arises and provides a break: not in the sense of unadorned drums building up tension for release, but like a sun through clouds. And while Pink should not be conflated with a proper followup to There Is Love in You, even as a singles comp it suggests that the undergrad producer circa Rounds is now postdoctorate, and Four Tet is capable of going deeper and expanding higher than almost anyone else out there.
