{"label":" B-Girl","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13177/homepage_large.a5baeef8.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brandon Stosuy","artist":"Alaska!","title":"Facts and Fictions","text":" The Los Angelesbased duo Alaska! Russell Pollard (bass, drums, and vocals) and Imaad Wasif (guitar, vocals) are also two thirds of The New Folk Implosion, one third of Sebadoh (Pollard), and the exfront man of Lowercase (Wasif), but they sound more like a troupe of psychheads from Olivia Tremor Control than Lou Barlow collaborators. On Emotions, Alaska!'s first album, the closest link to Barlow's aesthetic is the nocaps, handwritten liner notes. Emotions is slicker than Lou's Shrimper cassettes and even some of Sebadoh's Sub Pop albums, but that carefree spirit of camaraderie is similar. Though Alaska! didn't leave much of an initial impression, resonance emerged over time, clarifying details and offering seemingly endless nooks of beauty worth exploring. I felt the Incredible String Band at the beginning of \"Rust And Cyanide\", and \"Resistance\" is almost Simon and Garfunkel, though not in the horrible elevator way Kings of Convenience translated them. Pollard and Wasif's voices lock together almost perfectly, like a single track doubledup. The fadeaway chorus of \"The Western Sphere\" had me imagining the duo backing away from the microphone and into some beautiful, hazy field as they breathe out the words; it's a gentle brushstroke Olivia Tremor Control use quite a bit. \"Love (To Be Your Main)\" evokes lateera Elliott Smith, sharing a similar buildup approach with \"Bled White\" and \"Baby Britain\". \"Broken\" could also be Smith, but during his Kill Rock Stars days: it has his falsetto, guitar percussion, and vocal lines resolved by shaking off the words. Though their reference points are somewhat obvious, Alaska! layer music differently than their primary predecessor. Whereas Smith bows to George Martin, Pollard and Wasif appear to be more fascinated by darker instrumentation, similar at times to the whirl of a preblowout 13th Floor Elevators. The only real clunkers on Emotions are the last two tracks, \"Nightmare X\" and \"In My Time\". \"Nightmare X\" goes nowhere, weirdly reminiscent of Smog's \"Be Hit\", which Lou Barlow took a stab at on 1995's Lou Barlow Plays Waterfront; \"In My Time\" is a repetitious mess of faux bravura where Pollard and Wasif sing \"inside the nightmare of my dream\" with seemingly straight faces, evoking the ridiculous semiilliterate solipsism of lateperiod Black Heart Procession and, at times, the naive guitar crackle of early Radiohead. This \"big guitar\" misstep is redolent of another awful masturbatory finish, \"Evil Keneival\", which haunts the CDversion of Lilys otherwise shimmering A Brief History of Amazing Letdowns. Whatever my minor gripes, Alaska! have constructed an impressive first album. On \"Rust and Cyanide\" the state and the band are evoked as place, person, history, and \"glorious world.\" This extended metaphor reminded me of the Velvet Underground's \"Stephanie Says\", in which \"Alaska\" is a nickname and a reasoning: \"She's not afraid to die, the people all call her Alaska.\" Weirdly, I kept hearing Reed as I listened to this, another fragment of beauty affixed to an already dreamy landscape. Perhaps Alaska! decided their work should embody the roller coaster evoked by the album's title; feelings are anything but balanced, but by making the two dourest tracks on Emotions its grand finale, they seem to feed into a general model of glorified selfloathing, as if it's too naive to escape a record on a high note. I'm definitely no optimist, but ending things with the resplendent \"Resistance\" would've been wiser: it's a stronger song that the other two, a fourminute meditation about, waking up, getting out of a town, breathing in the seasons and going back home. It gets cold and dark in Alaska, sure, but don't forget the months where there's never a sunset. "}
