{"label":" Kitsuné","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/12999/homepage_large.29523571.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Kitsuné Maison 6: The Melodic One","text":" Download overload isn't the only way French indiedance label Kitsuné has been a victim of its own successful aesthetic. Their previous Kitsuné Maison compilations showcased a ridiculously long list of interesting acts great and terrible, sometimes at the same time who in one way or another combine a punk/DIY mindset with dance: Hot Chip, Digitalism, Metronomy, Simian Mobile Disco, Bloc Party, LoFiFunk, Au Revoir Simone, Joakim, Wolf Mother, MSTRKRFT, Klaxons, Van She, Feist, Guns N' Bombs, M.I.A., the list goes on. There's been a good amount of variety on these comps, but this is a genre with a fairly low bar to entry: big obvious beats, some not overly polished vocals, and a decent jpeg from LastNightsParty are enough to get you started.As Balearicstyle slow disco, dubstep, and minimal techno provide headier and less populist alternatives, and the biggest names in its discography become successful, Kitsuné is skimming off the top of an increasingly large pool of lowrisk electrohouse tracks. But Kitsuné Maison 6 is subtitled The Melodic One, presumably because it also includes some nondance material. That's a smart move, and basically all of the disc is at least listenable. Still, it can't match previous standouts like Simian Mobile Disco's \"I Believe\", Whitest Boy Alive's \"Done With You\", Yelle's \"Cause De Garçons\", Jenny Wilson's \"Let My Shoes Lead Me Forward\", Feist's \"My Moon My Man\", Thieves Like Us's \"Drugs in My Body\", or Crystal Castles' \"Knights\" and a lot of those were melodic, too.On Kitsuné Maison 6, elder electroclashers Fischerspooner no longer stand out as much for their luxurious production values, exhibited here on the breathy, buzzing \"Danse en France (D.I.M. Remix)\". Glossier still is Grovesnor's Balearic blueeyed 1980s electrosoul ballad \"Drive Your Car (Hot Chip Remix)\", arguably the biggest highlight. Also occasionally hitting the serotonin spot is Heartsrevolution's \"Ultraviolence\", which gives Crystal Castles a better run for their haunted analogue distortoscreamhouse money than You Love Her Coz She's Dead's \"Superheroes\". ATrak's bassy, \"Hustler\"like \"Say Whoa\" still sounds like as good a way to start a run assuming you're still capable of such a thing after all this downloading as it did when it originally appeared on his entry in Nike's Original Run series. BENI's \"My Love Sees You\" isn't \"My Love\", but it's fine enough vocaltweaked spacey disco. And autoKratz's pulsing \"Stay the Same (Edit)\", though sort of like a blander version of the Teenagers, stops to let a coin spin for about eight seconds halfway through. As novelty goes, this is fun.It's not that Kitsuné Maison 6 has the low points of even a couple of its predecessors, it's just that it's rarely worth losing many brain cells over. Another somewhat memorable track, Ted & Francis' organdrenched \"I Wish I Was a Polar Bear (Arctic Urgency)\", ought to be in some Quentin Tarantinotype movie two decades from now: an earnest icecap electropop equivalent of Harry Nilsson's \"Coconut\" (you can skip the breakdown, though, Quent oh, and I'll have my people tell you where to send the check). LoFiFunk's \"Want U\", which puts chunky guitars and synth strobes above handclaps and a thumping beat, will be a favorite of adolescent unrequited lovers who are also bloggers. Le Roux's sultry \"Quicksand\" has a syncopated rhythm and keyboards; bring on the José González cover. Speaking of Sweden, they'd never have called this The Melodic One over there. But that's a story for another RSSreader tag. "}
