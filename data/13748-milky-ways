The busy producer/DJ/songwriter has spent the last decade remixing artists like Cut Copy and Annie while working for France's Tigersushi Records. A classically trained composer, Joakim periodically submits fulllengths of his own material, genrejumping affairs that play like the product of an artist with disparate, longdeveloped ideas and nontraditional thoughts about what a fulllength should accomplish. Milky Ways, Joakim's latest offering, vacillates between lengthy psychrock dirges, Italodisco frippery, and foggy artpop, a de facto running commentary on contemporary trends.Despite his shapeshifting, Joakim's reputation lies firmly in the electronic realm, and even the openminded will have trouble preparing themselves for \"Back to Wilderness\", an eightminute squall of distorted guitars trampled by huge, live drums. This may be the product of Joakim's working band, the Disco (want running commentary, zeitgeist? The Disco were formerly known as the Ectoplasmic Band), a relationship that sees a handful of Milky Ways' songs recorded virtually live. Expectation obliterator, palate cleanser, band workout, whatever: \"Wilderness\" probably should've populated a Bside somewhere, because the remainder of Milky Ways musters plenty of variance without resorting to such transparent adventuring.Joakim's best work on Milky Ways comes via contemplative dance fodder. \"Spiders\" stretches out on short, timorous arpeggios and occasional guitar chirps, clearing room for a slowchanted group chorus. \"Ad Me\" reestablishes order after \"Wilderness\" with blasts of dated, fake symphonics, and robotic, vocoder'd chatter. On \"Love & Romance & A Special Person\", a resonant majorkey vocal melody burrows into Bouaziz's computerlove funk. The Krauty \"Travel in Vain\", its nodding momentum paced and familiar, touches on James Murphy's adroit simplicity.Joakim could probably roll off an entire album of these electropunk gems, but he's too skittish. Sometimes the aforementioned \"Wilderness\", the postrock jamminess of \"King Kong is Dead\" he trips over his own shoelaces; often he molds weird, lingering pop music. \"Glossy Papers\" sounds like Giorgio Moroder taking on 1960s psych; \"Medusa\" mimics that chime and crash of Caribou's spicier compositions. \"Fly Like an Apple\" is ominous, lurking rock pastiche. \"Little Girl\", the album's closer and easily its softest moment, is a rhythmic ballad based on a William Blake poem. This is the work of a rarely satisfied auteur with a likeminded band: like Beck if he saw himself both too gaudy and too ragamuffin.This compositional variety results in an album that lacks a cohesive narrative. If you're keeping score at home, the above basically paints Milky Ways as a dronemetalelectrosoulfunk album, plus or minus some 18th century poetry. To those without the stomach for Joakim's waywardness, Milky Ways will often sound as much during the course of a listen. For those who are feeling adventurous but forgiving of the same, Joakim is a worthy companion. "}
