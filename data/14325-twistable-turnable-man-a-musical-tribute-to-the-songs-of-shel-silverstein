The occasion was a celebration of the Chicagoborn Shel Silverstein, and therein lies the writer's broad appeal. Silverstein, of course, wrote some of the most beloved children's books of all time (Where the Sidewalk Ends, The Missing Piece, A Light in the Attic,Â The Giving Tree), but his cartoons and poems also appeared regularly in the pages of Playboy. Silverstein wrote plenty of songs, too, ranging from kiddie fare (the diaperset staple \"Boa Constrictor\") to songs made famous by the likes of Loretta Lynn (\"One's On the Way\"), Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show (\"The Cover of 'Rolling Stone'\"), and Johnny Cash, who famously recorded both \"25 Minutes to Go\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\".It's the late Silverstein's friendship and frequent collaboration with singer Bobby Bare that brought about Twistable, Turnable Man: A Musical Tribute to the Songs of Shel Silverstein and its attendant allstar cast. Bare recorded several of Silverstein's songs, beginning in the early 1970s, and eventually son Bobby Bare, Jr. got in on the act too. Between the two of them and of course taking into account Silverstein's enduring appeal an uncommonly good lineup of other friends and followers quickly came on board. Alas, Oldham's not here, but plenty of Silverstein peers (such as John Prine and Kris Kristofferson, both of whom had written with Silverstein) are, plus younger fans (like My Morning Jacket and Andrew Bird), with Silverstein's whimsical but memorable compositions given an array of welcome if mostly safe readings.Perhaps most unconventional is Bird's take on the title track, if only because Bird apparently knew Silverstein only as a writer and crafted his own Birdlike tune around the poem he picked. Yet several other tracks here reveal a few subtle new facets of Silverstein and performer alike. My Morning Jacket, for example, recorded a version of \"Lullabys, Legends and Lies\" true to its roots (it was the title track of Bare's 1973 collection of Silverstein songs), but much more straightup country than the band is generally known for (MMJ closes the album with a similarly conservative duration aside \"26 Second Song\"). Frank Black and Joey Santiago turn \"The Cover of the 'Rolling Stone'\" inside out, into a strange conflation of Black's own country forays and Santiago's trademark skronk. Dr. Dog turns the folky \"Unicorn Song\" into a kitschy 60s trip.Of course, plenty of acts on hand provide exactly what you might expect. Lucinda Williams' haunting version of \"The Ballad of Lucy Jordan\" underscores what Bare has noted as the relative dearth of femalecentric songs in the Silverstein catalog. Against all odds, Todd Snider does \"A Boy Named Sue\" justice by simply following Cash's lead and not taking himself too seriously. Likewise goodsport Kristofferson's rendition of \"The Winner\" offers wellphrased winking couplet after couplet, and keeping in character John Prine sounds suitably and effectively grizzled on \"This Guitar Is for Sale\". Alas, Nanci Griffith's predictably overearnest \"The Giving Tree\" leans too hard on sentimentality, and while Sarah Jarosz fronts the Decemberists' bluegrass spinoff Black Prairie for a fine take on the prostitute tale \"Queen of the Silver Dollar\", the results don't rise above \"Prairie Home Companion\" fodder. Country legend Ray Price, on the other hand, makes \"Me and Jimmy Rodgers\" sound like a decadesold jukebox staple.And then there's \"Daddy What If\", a sweet novelty that sums up the project quite nicely. Bobby Bare had a country hit with the song back in 1973, featuring his then sixyearold son as a duet partner. Here Bobby Bare, Jr. repeats the gesture, only with his own small daughter doing duet duties. If anything, neither this song nor anything on Twistable, Turnable Man, is particularly definitive, but Silverstein's simple songs don't really lend themselves to definitive performances (OK, \"A Boy Named Sue\" aside). Designed as such or not, they're not really songs for anybody in particular. They're songs for everybody, made to be passed on from generation and generation like a wellworn copy of A Light in the Attic. "}
