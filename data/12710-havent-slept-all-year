{"label":" Scat","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13681/homepage_large.82ee0622.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stuart Berman","artist":"Cobra Verde","title":"Haven't Slept All Year","text":" For a band of middleaged Cleveland artpunk misfits born of recordcollector rock tradition, Cobra Verde have adapted rather well to the newschool indie economy, turning themselves into a TVlicensing machine and landing plum placements on \"Entourage\" and \"The O.C.\" But if Cobra Verde's eternally youthful swagger belies their almost twodecade pedigree, the story of the band's sixth album provided a sad reminder that you can't be a kid forever upon its initial completion in summer of 2007, frontman John Petkovic was forced to care for his cancerstricken mother, who passed away that December. The album, and the band, were put on ice for over a year during which Petkovic through suffered severe, prolonged bouts of insomnia.So that album title is no exaggeration. But if the songs contained within predate Petkovic's breakdown, they suggest that, even before his familial trauma, the singer was wellaccustomed to an afterhours regimen of strip clubs and booze. Cobra Verde's music has always simmered with nocturnal menace and seedy suggestion, but on Haven't Slept All Year, there's a greater awareness of the price for staying up all night: Having to make amends in the morning. The result is an album plays out in a binary sequence of comically overthetop drunkrock benders and sincere, openhearted pleas for forgiveness.But until the morning comes, Cobra Verde are happy to appeal to the most baseic of instincts: \"Entourage\"approved opener \"World Can't Have Her\" is essentially a rewrite of AC/DC's \"Girls Got Rhythm\". But as certified students of rock'n'roll mythology (Petkovic is a journalist by trade; guitarist Frank Vazzano teaches popmusic history at Cleveland State University), Cobra Verde project a keen selfawareness: the Clashcity rocker \"Riot in the Food Court\" climaxes with a deadpan declaration of \"I'm in love with strippers on drugs,\" while the Replacementsstyled nightclub jitters of \"Wasted Again\" carry the admission that \"drinking songs are so typical.\" The implication is that Cobra Verde aren't playing around with hardrock conventions merely for populist appeal and easy soundtrack money, but because it's precisely the sort of music that you'd hear blaring in the peeler bars and neonlit corner dives that Petkovic's protagonists inhabit.Cobra Verde also realize their \"drunken sex addict\" antiheroes are not the sort of people you want to spend an entire album hanging out with particularly when they start leaning too heavily on the barband swing (\"I Could Go to Hell for You\"). So for every time Petkovic is called on to play the sleazeball, there's a chance to redeem himself as the sweetheart, and for the band to apply the more expansive approach that marked 2005's Copycat Killers allcovers collection: \"Home in the Highrise\" colors in its sketch of skyscraperliving sterility with rich Byrdsian harmonies; the turnanewleaf anthems \"Something About the Bedroom\" and \"Run Away\" outfit Pavement with skinny ties and keytars. By penultimate acoustic ballad \"Can't Believe\", Petkovic is seeking forgiveness for all his sins รก la Lou Reed on the Velvets' \"Jesus\" from a god he doesn't believe in, at which point he's sentenced to an afterlife in the \"Haunted Heavens,\" where he's surrounded by devils and dead lovers, but where judging by the pristine janglepop presentation they're spinning the Flamin' Groovies for all eternity. In light of Petkovic's annus miserablis, that's the kind of hell he can certainly deal with. "}
