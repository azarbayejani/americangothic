{"label":" Drag City","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/3196/homepage_large.74766edd.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ryan Schreiber","artist":"Edith Frost","title":"Love is Real EP","text":" \"Love is real/ Real is love/ Love is asking/ To be loved.\" No, this is not a cover of John Lennon's 1971 (Johnson & Johnson lotion ad) classic. And it's a good thing, because while Frost would do an excellent cover of that Plastic Ono Band gem, her song is much more refreshing. Last year's Telescopic only further proved Frost as one of the greatest female songwriters of the decade. Songs like the album's intense opener, \"Walk On the Fire,\" the beautiful \"Tender Kiss\" and the haunting \"You Belong to No One\" displayed her talent for writing stunningly succinct lyrics and undeniable musical prowess. Frost also has a knack for enlisting the help of Chicago's musical elite for her records. Her full length debut, Calling Over Time, featured the talents of Gastr Del Sol's Jim O'Rourke and David Grubbs, and Sean O'Hagan of Stereolab and the High Llamas. Telescopic boasted production by Royal Trux's Neil Haggerty and Jennifer Herrema (mysteriously credited as \"Adam and Eve\"). Now, on Love is Real, her three song snack between albums, she's brought along the Sea and Cake's Archer Prewitt, Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo, and Sam Prekop on cover art. (Let's talk for a second about Prekop's art, by the way. The guy's fuckin' awesome. 'Nuff said.) The title cut off the new EP is Edith Frost at her finest. Her straight forward and earnest lyrics have only improved since Calling Over Time. She now throws out stunningly succinct lines like \"Wonder what you're doing now/ Listen for your telephone call/ Nothing to talk about/ Make up any reason to stall\" so casually that it seems like her second nature. Frost's vocals have also become increasingly controlled she's become capable of delivering lines like \"Is there anything at all to talk about/ My love is real,\" implying incredible yearning while retaining her dignity. Perhaps the most impressive gift Frost has to offer is that she's able to say so much with so few words. \"Between Us\" is a sparse love song about drinking with a fellow musician that serves as a fine example of Frost being melancholy sans cheese. \"The Last One\" is an unexpected slice of traditional country from Frost who rarely strays far from her folkpop roots. Accompanied solely by an acoustic guitar, she executes like it's the only genre she's ever known. Musically, the track is on par with more upbeat Gillian Welch numbers, but doesn't seem to connect lyrically.Love is Real should tide us over until her forthcoming album is released, if only because the title track is one of Edith Frost's best works to date. And judging from the sound of this EP, it just gets better from here. The next album's her Plastic Ono Band. "}
