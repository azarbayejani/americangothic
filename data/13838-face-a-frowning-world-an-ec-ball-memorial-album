Deusner","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Face a Frowning World: An E.C. Ball Memorial Album","text":" That album cover up there is misleading: When E.C. Ball faced a frowning world, he did so with a smile. Or at least that's the impression his songs give that the sternvoiced singer and songwriter took immense joy in praising the Lord through music. When he wasn't driving a school bus and running a service station in Rugby, Virginia, the folkgospel artist and his wife Orna traveled around Appalachia, playing churches of all denominations and radio stations of all wattages. Ball was no fireandbrimstone scold, though, nor did he fashion himself as a Godappointed teacher with special moral authority. Instead, he remained humble, content, and hopeful, writing simple songs with simple messages. Even at his darkest, his songs celebrate faith: \"Lord, I want more religion,\" he sings on one of his most famous compositions. \"Religion makes me happy.\"Not that every song is upbeat, but Ball preached salvation more than damnation. By and large, the artists on Face a Frowning World, which declares itself  a \"memorial album\" rather than a tribute (I'm guessing for reasons of Christian humility), revere this aspect of Ball's music, and in covering his songs, they also consider his faith whether they share it or not. Dave Bird testifies proudly on \"He's My God\", and Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy extols the stalwartness of \"John the Baptist\" before keening ostentatiously over Catherine Irwin's earthy vocals on \"Beautiful Star of Bethlehem\".By contrast, Rayna Gellert's softspoken \"Lord, I Want More Religion\" is a ruminative, plainspoken prayer, a subdued take that suggests a oneonone with the Big Man Himself. Even on \"Tribulations\", sung here by Joe Manning and Glen Dentinger, Ball's depiction of the apocalypse contrasts dramatically with the promise of rescue and reward: \"When the fire come down from heaven and the blood shall fill the sea, I'll be carried home by Jesus and forever with him be.\" The two Louisville musicians sing those lines steadfastly, with a content resignation bolstered by the band's spare arrangement.Face a Frowning World has the feel of a jubilee, as Louisville's Health & Happiness Family Gospel Band back a range of Ball fans and followers with the enthusiasm of a Sunday morning pickup band. On the whole, they keep things loose and lively, although at times their energy gets the better of them: They liven up Jon Langford's \"When I Get Home I'm Gonna Be Satisfied\", but while the spirit is willing, their cover is too loud, too lusty, too worldly. Not that Ball was strictly a religious singer. In fact, he and his wife had a sprawling repertoire that included secular songs, and Face a Frowning World strains to make room for a few of them. Michael Hurley smocks through \"The Early Bird Always Gets the Worm\" as if he wrote it himself, and Pokey LaFarge turns \"Poor Old Country Lad\" into a jumpin' C&W romp. On the other hand, the Handsome Family inexplicably transform the playful children's rhyme \"Jenny Jenkins\" into a slow, dour duet that sucks all the fun out of the song's jumble of syllables. They turn Ball's smile upside down. "}
