{"label":" Too Pure","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/13565/homepage_large.c282188b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jason Crock","artist":"Future of the Left","title":"Curses","text":" We keep posthumously lavishing praise on Mclusky, but their appeal is deeper and less immediate than it might seem: More than just being meaner and louder than their peers, they dropped brilliant nonsequiturs and generous dollops of hometown hate within perfectly twisted punk anthems. The proper names, liars, and criminals that made up their lyrics were like a world we only wished we could fully relate to. Which was fine by them: Whatever you were doing, they wanted no part of it. Jarcrew graduated from Wales' underground around the same time as Mclusky, but they lacked the more wellknown band's swagger and nonchalance. They were the brilliant, creative, genredefying geeks who tried a bit too hard Mclusky were off pulling fire alarms while the Jarcrew were writing screenplays in the computer lab after hours.Future of the Left is the mutually beneficial pact between the two camps, with guitarist/vocalist Andy Falkous and drummer Jack Egglestone from Mclusky joining forces with the singerturnedbassist of Jarcrew stripping down, geeking out, emoting earnestly for at least a few seconds at a time, and indulging several silly ideas that almost always come together in the end. Is it possible for musicians to show growth and maturity while singing about pretty pussycats and couples who eat sausage on a stick? Curses, the band's debut, makes a compelling argument for \"yes.\"The big difference between FOTL and their predecessors is the use of keyboards, but skeptical fans will be pleased to learn that the keys are wielded like broken toys with the pointy bits leveled squarely at the audience. The oscillating whine of \"Suddenly It's a Folk Song\" sounds like an infant's mobile set to \"seizure,\" yet somehow makes for a stunning slacker anthem, while the guitarless \"Manchasm\" is just a platform to lampoon one Mark Foley (no, not the former U.S. congressman, the coowner of a Cardiff studio). Once you've gotten used to the idea, the neanderthal new wave of \"Team:Seed\" and \"Manchasm\" are particularly gratifying.There are familiar textures here, certainly, but they're a bit more detached about the grind. \"The Lord Hates a Coward\" is impressively ugly, but almost clinical in its odd harmonics and precise punches. \"Plague of Onces\" follows up with a quick shot of tempo, adrenaline, and judicious screaming from Falkous, and it probably benefits from being more strippeddown and arch, leaving all it's rhythmic twists and purple bass tones barer and more jagged. Even \"Small Bones Small Bodies\", the most Mcluskyish of the bunch, is much more syncopated and nervous, barring the queasy middle eight that could have been ripped from Incesticide.By the time they do get loud and stupid on \"adeadenemyalwayssmellsgood\", it seems almost plain in comparison. There are moments that sound a little more like exercises than songs, like the circular structures of \"My Gymnastic Past\" and \"Fuck the Countryside Alliance\", but you'll grow to love or maybe be calloused by the group's sharp edges, fitting better with quirkier lyrics and increased variation from song to song. (I'd certainly never guess they'd add glammy piano rolls to \"Real Men Hunt in Packs\", coming off like Jesus Lizard taking on Elton John.)There's a surprising focus on the vocals here, but Falkous proves himself more than up to the task. The wallofharmonies on \"Fingers Become Thumbs!\" or \"Suddenly It's a Folk Song\" that are unexpected and inspired, while his fey and mocking inflections dropped in the hardest tracks like \"Plague of Onces\" and \"Small Bones Small Bodies\" make them that much more appealing. These songs also veer from baiting and bilious to tender in small bounds: The lyrics of \"Manchasm\" move from \"Colin is a pussy\" to \"Colin is a very pretty pussycat,\" while the selfdeprecating lyrical fragments of \"Suddenly It's a Folk Song\" end on the line, \"Now we are not burdened by love.\"With tracks like \"Small Bones Small Bodies\" and \"Plague of Onces\", it'd be understandable if you walked away wishing Curses put the pedal down a bit more often. However, toning it down just a bit shows that Falkous was more multifaceted than many might have surmised, only because Mclusky's thrash was so potent it was easy to overlook. It's doesn't sustain tension like Mclusky Do Dallas, but not much else does. Curses retains all the bile, all the laughs, and adds enough musicality to remind you that even after changing the program somewhat they're still unmatched at balancing equal parts humor and spite with a tune.
