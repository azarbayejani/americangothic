Not that heartbreak is a particularly popular thing, but there's always been plenty of it to go around. It's universal, linking the most modest homerecorded navel gazing to the most bombastic and overproduced of top 40 fodder. As the J. Geils Band put, \"love stinks.\" Yeah yeah. So Local H's 12 Angry Months is hardly the first breakup album, but it's likely one of the few explicitly conceived as such. Following what one imagines was an especially bitter, painful dumping, Lucas wrote a song for each month of the aftermath. By his own account, he wanted to push the usual woeisme motif to the limits, baring his soul while stripping his target down to the bone. But Lucas' bad time is our good time, as he remains one of the few songwriters up to all the Cheap Trick comparisons. After all, Cheap Trick were ultimately more power than pop (at least until they actually went pop), and since their grungeera breakthrough Local H has kept their muscles toned and flexed. For what is in essence the ultimate expression of inadequacy, selfloathing, failure, and impotence, 12 Angry Months is a tough little thing. Whatever girl broke Lucas' heart clearly did at least enough harm to last a calendar year, and Lucas is fighting back. \"Yeah, I hope you have a lonely life\" he sings in the snarling \"White Belt Boys\", a Greg Dulliworthy raveup that correlates to April and follows March's equally unforgiving offering \"BMW Man\" (\"this is crazy, I can't believe that you replaced me,\" Lucas sings of his fancy car driving, probably Republican romantic substitute). \"The Summer of Boats\", a rousing power ballad, begins with a touch of forgiveness, but by \"TaxiCabs\" Lucas is back to vengeful again.  No one said you can't be angry and catchy, though, and \"24 Hour BreakUp Session\" does both with aplomb, like a more literalminded Nirvana. \"Jesus Christ! Did You See The Size of the Sperm Whale?\" may be a little injokey, but it's not hard to catch the gist of Lucas' vitriol as he catches up with his ex. \"I'm thinking he can have you,\" he snarls. \"You're just a groupie...to think I used to fuck you.\" Ouch. No wonder another powerballad, \"Simple Pleas\", comes next. \"I can't let go,\" Lucas wails in that one. No kidding.  By the end, the nearly 10minute \"Hand to Mouth\", Lucas and his former better half have reached some semblance of cease fire (at least in his head), but the damage has already been done. He's already recounted splitting up his record collection in \"The One With 'Kid'\" and a failed attempt at reconciliation in \"Machine Shed Wrestling\" (\"as a product you would be great...as a lover, you're just a bust,\" he zings). What's left is exorcising demons. That surely won't get the girl back, especially after the scorched earth approach of 12 Angry Months, but at least Lucas got a good record out of the ordeal. "}
