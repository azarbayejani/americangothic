To listen to Daft Clubfronttoback is and it's pointless to exaggerate here to watch a loved one be physically dismembered. The poverty of language prevents me from fully recounting these horrors in my chosen medium, but they say a picture is worth 1,000 of somethingorother, so to this end, I've called on the doodling acumen of Harvard Lampoon artist Farley Katz in the hopes that he might supplement this tour of  Daft Club  's trail of tears with his feted cartoon stanchion. With his help, I'll compare the treasured etudes of  Discovery  with their mercilessly maimed remixes.  \"Face to Face\"  To many, \"Face to Face\" seemed the energetic centerpiece of  Discovery  's otherwise decidedly laidback second side. Cosmo Vitelli sacrifices the charming bigbeat start/stops and jittery cutups of the original, in lieu of an amateursounding minimal thump, dreadful organ lines, and disorienting stereo pans that make his remix virtually intolerable on headphones. Here's the replay: It gets worse. \"Face to Face\" also gets a 90s Detroit acidhouse treatment fed through the Oakenfold \"through the matrix\" machine responsible for that mountain of $20 fivedisc Ibiza trance box sets that line the entrance to Tower Records. It's called the \"Demon Remix\" and God is really pissed right now.  \"Crescendolls\"  \"Crescendolls\", the youthful instrumental that follows the dark vocoded romp \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\", is  Discovery  at its most fancyfree. The stringy chromatic riff that climbs the scale amidst the bustle of tinny percussion, the blithe chorus who would shroud these with a glaze of boxed beats and mindless eightbit noises? Not Laidback Luke, certainly! He would  never  do that!  \"One More Time\"  Blaring horns, shuffle beat, and vapid lyrics that are perfect for the floor, plus a breakitdown (!) and a builditbackupagain (!!!) midsection you never saw coming! \"One More Time\" is  on  , and if you're like best buds with Daft Punk, you're gonna get in a hot tub with some hot babes and celebrate. It's not like Romanthony's gonna do something stupid like do an acoustic version of the song and actually sing without those vocal effects that would be suicide!  \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\"  Best song ever! Rubbery basslines, pink neon synthguitars, and the least annoying application of the vocoder in the history of the instrument this fucker has it all, and as such, magically transports even the most retarded among us onto giant party blimps where we can dance drunk and air guitar to its electric roboVai madness.  Man  , I love this song. It's a good thing there are no \"soul snatchers coming\" to \"snatch [our] spirits from the club.\" Right, Neptunes?  Indeed, as rarely as remix albums work out for the best, this record bottoms out on par with Weezer tribute albums, deployed WMDs and birth defects. Welcome to  Daft Club  : Guantanamo Bay, 2038.  "}
