Excerpt from Stéréotypie's press release: \"This ideal, as a conglomeration of homemade fantasies, seems to unveil the limitations and the obsolescence of making a fantasy of physical and mechanical perfection come true, and also uncovers all the excitement attached to this fantasy, by fulfilling obsessions about norms and evenness together with a certain imperfection.\"Stéréotypie's concept about fantasies being mistranslated yet still rewarding the artist with an unexpected \"perfection\" is nothing avantgarde. It's the essence of art. Hell, one of the most poignant moments in Britney Spears' legacy was caught on her Live from Las Vegas concert DVD when, midway through the lass' performance, she's dragged away by men in black leaving the spotlight to Jon Voight and Britney's wideeyed sis in a nightgown by his lap. 'Ol Joe Buck then recites to her a poem about handsome princes, princesses, virginal purity, and the chastity belt. And each syllable he utters is punctuated by a distorted hiss of 200+ decibel amplification. Poetry translated into white noise. DACM thankfully dwells on another planet. The first release from the project's noisenik mastermind, Peter \"Pita\" Rehberg, was 2002's Showroom Dummies a dance piece that mainly involved models both clothed and nude in mannequin poses. His music typically domesticates and sculpts cold, raw electricity. Rehberg's solo work on Showroom drenched a few \"mainstream\" conventions of timbre in sulfuric acid. His lawnmower drone treatment of a cliché trancetechno synth melody was priceless. In Stéréotypie, his partnership with posttechno chanteuse Tujiko Noriko adds a deeper dynamic and genuine humanity to the DACM sound.Stéréotypie is a beauty that threatens to evaporate at anytime. Hence, the \"perfect fantasy versus imperfect reality\" concept. DACM stages an order built on rotting stilts, as almost every moment is tinged with scrambled data and irregular pacing. The album's finest song, \"Vidya\", embodies that element tweaking and liquidating sunbursts of a warpspeed synth patch to create the sensation of falling up into the sky; an elating grace before disintegrating into the atmosphere. Similar tracks also find a balance between playfulness and delirium. \"LN Start\" erupts with a thick refrigeratordrone lightly showered by microtones. \"Marie\" and \"Outparis Kiss\" also take such microtones and mutate them into happy accidents. The 12minute \"Birthday\" loops a Boards of Canadacaliber synth trance before vibraphones brilliantly saunter in. Beaming with such pluck for at least its first 10 seconds is \"Latex\", a solo piece for latex that is akin to Tom Zé's classic, balloonontooth experiments. The album's weakest moment is \"Party\", a machinegroove with congested sinuses, looped into oblivion. Besides \"Vidya\", Stéréotypie's other admirably peculiar moments are when Noriko's fingerprints are felt. \"Angel\" is vintage Noriko, a ballad about sacrificing one's soul for love. She whispers with nearvampiric intimacy: \"I'll give you everything/ Even this memory.../ I dream to be what I'll never be.\" She drives the track's sexual tension alongside oddball guitar twangs, fractured synths, and an eightmilehigh bass thump. \"Patty\" is also arresting: It features decapitated, Copacabana loungejazz that wanders in a circle as Noriko meows Japanese, suddenly uttering \"stereotype\" during a silence. The lyric is a nagging reminder of the album's title, and may imply that DACM's work here is \"stereotypical\" of so much posttechno and its habit of soiling the sweet. "}
