{"label":" Sony / Almost Gold","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/11328/homepage_large.301ec1f5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Love","artist":"Walter Meego","title":"Voyager","text":"  Within the past month and a half, two songs from Chicago electropop duo Walter Meego's fulllength debut, Voyager, have appeared on the hit ABC dramedy \"Ugly Betty\". The show's title protagonist is young and unprepossessing, but gains confidence and command as her story unfolds. However unwittingly, Voyager mimics this evolution, initially presenting a pair of facile, derivative popsmiths who seem to perceptibly mature into dynamic artists in the short space between the record's beginning and end. Opening with the Bettyfeatured \"Forever\", Walter Meego emerges at first as merely an especially blithe practitioner of the kind of affected, heavily beholden synthpop that's been particularly trendy of late thanks in part to the legitimately great retro stylings of Cut Copy. Faintly cloying where Cut Copy is cool, Walter Meego's initial efforts here are fun but almost obnoxiously lightweight, as the admittedly enjoyable ringing synths of \"Wanna Be a Star\" and cheeseball guitar riffs of \"Girls\" nonetheless edge towards the irritatingly shiny territory of simpleminded labelmate Calvin Harris. Starting with \"Tomorrowland\", however, Walter Meego begins to round into shape, teasing out a distinct Beatles influence (specifically evoking \"Across the Universe\") that subtly but nicely distinguishes the group from some of its more rigorously 1980sentrenched brethren. That paisley pastiche is followed by the distinctly offputting \"Keyhole\" only in the case of Walter Meego \"offputting\" is a refreshing descriptor given how baldly easy it was to swallow the album's first few tracks. A distant cousin to Radiohead's \"Climbing Up the Walls\", \"Keyhole\" puts hazily distorted vocals, creeping piano, and doubletime drums towards obliterating memory of the playskool pop that marked Voyager's first act.  The tracks that follow \"Keyhole\" only strengthen the impression that Walter Meego deliberately frontloaded their record with hummable banalities in order to earn the privilege of going darker and deeper over its second half. The fat grooves and layered effects of \"Lost\" suggest the group may have a higher ceiling than \"ideal Hot Chip opening act,\" while the fantastic contrast between precise, hardhitting beats and pillowsoft vocals on the succeeding \"Letting Go\" makes you disbelieve this could really be the same act that sounded like a lobotomized synthpop Fountains of Wayne on \"Girls\" just five tracks earlier. Not only is the music suddenly more dense and interesting, but singer Justin Sconza's vocals are noticeably more compelling and commanding as well.  Walter Meego has one more quickchange trick up its sleeve, as following the innocuous \"Baby Please\" they close Voyager with a pair of dreamily anaesthetized floaters, a predictable comedown perhaps but an impressive show of pacing and structure from a group that initially threatened to churn out a record of unmediated retro tack. Much as America Ferrera, the bespectacled, bracesburdened star of \"Ugly Betty\", is actually a stone fox in real life, so too does Walter Meego offer up more than you'd first assume.  "}
