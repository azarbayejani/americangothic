The only truly minor album in the Beatles' catalogue isn't really an album at all. Yellow Submarine, released in January 1969, is the soundtrack to the featurelength cartoon of the same name, a project with which the Beatles had little involvement. The idea of an animated film stretched back to 1965, but these were busy years for the band, and the project was pushed to the backburner. Once the movie finally got underway in 1967, the Beatles had no real interest in the details.In one sense, the Yellow Submarine project is the opposite of Magical Mystery Tour. While the latter film was derided as pretentious and incoherent, the Yellow Submarine feature was wellreceived. And while the record releases associated with Magical Mystery Tour are of staggeringly high quality, the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered. Brian Epstein had died in August, and with him gone, there was little motivation for the Beatles to participate in any meaningful way. So actors mimicked their voices, their input into the story consisted of a meeting or two with the filmmakers, and when it came time to assemble the soundtrack, they combed through the vault to see what was left over.Of the six tracks by the Beatles on the album's first side, two, \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"All You Need Is Love\", are already familiar from their original contexts (as part of Revolver and as a single, respectively). The other four were holdovers from sessions in 1967 (Paul McCartney's \"All Together Now\", George Harrison's \"It's All Too Much\" and \"It's Only a Northern Song\") and 1968 (John Lennon's \"Hey Bulldog\"). They never found release during the time they were recorded because, well, they weren't good enough. Granted, we're talking about a time when the Beatles were making some of the finest pop albums of all time, so the question of what constitutes \"good enough\" is relative. But even setting aside their exceedingly high standards, this lot is pretty middling, if certainly still enjoyable.Neither of Harrison's songs ranks with his best. \"Only a Northern Song\" and \"It's All Too Much\" are filled with swirling psychedelic production tooting horns, backward instruments, shimmering percussion but beneath the din there's not much else interesting going on. \"Only a Northern Song\" at least has a good joke going for it, simultaneously alluding to the North of England and the Beatles' LennonMcCartneydominated publishing company (i.e., no matter what Harrison wrote for this particular number, it belonged to Northern Songs, Ltd.). But \"It's All Too Much\" stretches on for an endless six and a half minutes, the constipated production in fruitless search of a tune. For McCartney's part, \"All Together Now\" is a cheery and pleasant singalong befitting an animated soundtrack, and Lennon's \"Hey Bulldog\" is a tough and funky pianodriven rocker, by a good margin the best song here. They might be secondrate Beatles songs, but still.To round out the album, the second side of Yellow Submarine is filled with George Martin's score for the film. Pieces like \"Pepperland\", \"Sea of Holes\", and \"March of the Meanies\", however they were received at the time, function now primarily as garish kitsch, lushly orchestrated orchestral music that could have come from anywhere. Personally, I can enjoy this stuff when I'm in the mood. The blandly anonymous but beautifully recorded swoop of strings, selfconsciously \"exotic\" percussion, and recurring thematic motifs serve as an intriguing sort of time capsule of a time when light \"beautiful music\" still commanded the ears of a sizeable listening pubic. But it's very easy to forget that the music has anything to do with the Beatles, or even popular music of the last 50 years, at least until the \"Yellow Submarine\" melody returns in \"Yellow Submarine in Pepperland\". As a souvenir of the film, Yellow Submarine has its place, and in fairness, it was never intended as a major release. But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise.[Note: Click here for an overview of the 2009 Beatles reissues, including discussion of the packaging and sound quality.] "}
