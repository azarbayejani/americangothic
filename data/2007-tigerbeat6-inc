{"label":" Tigerbeat6","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/1991/homepage_large.3ea17442.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ryan Schreiber","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Tigerbeat6, Inc.","text":" A young German scholar sits with wirerimmed glasses at a van der Rohe desk in a converted warehouse loft. Atop the desk sits a Powerbook and a small, steel lamp, the room's only source of light. Here, the man sequences clicks, squeals, and an occasional melodic chime into algebraic patterns to create a sound as minimalist as his living space. If he's feeling extravagant, which is rare, he may insert a warm drone beneath the squirming pulse. It's dance music you can't dance to, and therefore, intelligent. This stereotype has long permeated the IDM community, and with good reason: it's considerably accurate. Countless auteurs release hundreds of minimalist IDM records every month, and with each new LP, the form seems to grow more predictable. Minimalism has seen its share of classic records, but electronic music moves quickly, and its genres invariably die quick, merciful deaths. Minimalist IDM isn't buried yet, but it's a limited formula. And you can only do so much with a formula before it becomes stagnant. Tigerbeat6, the label run out of Oakland, California by that impossibly clever electrobrat Kid606, is one of the first IDM labels to take The Big Step Forward. Their concept: stripping intelligent dance music of its intelligence. Often resorting to outright silliness, and sometimes parody, Tigerbeat6 is doing for clicks and cuts what Ninja Tune did for jungle in 1997. That is, making it fun. Damn fun.Tigerbeat6, Inc. celebrates the label's incorporation as a legally recognized business entity with two discs of uncontrolled mayhem. Artists from several labels including the groundbreaking Mille Plateaux imprint, Planet \\xB5, and Domino lent some of their unreleased material to this 44track compilation. But the spotlight shines bright on Tigerbeat's artists, whose music is so fractured and hyperactive it could practically be termed ADDDM. Kicking off with Gamers in Exile's highly melodic and Macintalklaced \"I am a Decent Man,\" the comp begins on a note that strikes a balance between the few \"serious\" tracks here and the general wackiness that infiltrates the bulk of the album. Then, we're flung headlong into \"kick'SC\" by Fossil (aka Pea Hix of Optiganally Yours), a justtotallyinsane 1\\xBD minutes that uses thunking drum, seasawing bass and manipulated vocal clips as percussion that pauses every four seconds to let Hix clue us into where, exactly, he's going to kick us (\"I'm gonna kick you in... in the face/ I'm gonna kick you... um... in the face/ I'm gonna kick you in the stomach/ I'm kick you, SC\"). And it just gets weirder from there. Cex's \"Furcoat\" features a wack parody of the MTV Music Awards before launching into a hilarious hiphop rap (\"Who's the man with no clothes, underwear, furcoat, chillin' in tha alley?\"). Knifehandchop's \"Sun Jammer is My Favorite Pokemon Trainer\" blatantly infringes on the copyrights of DMX's \"What's My Name.\" bLectum from bLechdom's \"aLways frank\" lays down squirting bass and lofi beats for a fauxLe Tigre smackdown whose lyrics, provided by Adult Rodeo's Mephany Stankins, scream: \"Always, Frank/ You're fucking up!\" And speaking of Le Tigre, Johanna Fateman herself contributes a beautiful, shimmering track from her electronic side project Swim with the Dolphins, which sounds not a bit like the band she made her name with. DAT Politics ricochet piercing tones off rubberband walls in the joyfully bouncy \"#21.\" Max Tundra goes Casio with the seemingly boomboxrecorded samba/slapbass hybrid of \"The Bill,\" and Stilluppseypa gives us the eerie interstellar tones of \"Nice Things to File Away.\" But not all of these tracks are drenched in lunacy. Noriko Tujiko hands in \"White Film,\" a gorgeous track off her Megoreleased Shojo Toshi album in which her lush, multitracked vocals gradually merge into a dense chorus of harmonysaturated bliss. D84's \"Rockitship\" incorporates a female vocal sample that seems to have come out of the early 20th century. Brad Laner provides a postrockin' 1994 cover of Can's \"One More Night\" by his old band, Medicine. Kid606 offers a sevenminute glitch/noisefest with an almost triphop beat called \"You Just Don't Understand\" that eventually becomes submerged in dense washes of shoegazing guitar. What more can I say about this? It's fucking brilliant! In a world where 90% of dance music heralds itself as \"intelligent\" and \"mathematical,\" it's refreshing to find an electronic label that can't discern the difference between \"there\" and \"they're\" in their press releases. With this compilation, Tigerbeat6 officially establishes itself as the future of IDM. With sonic assaults of unfettered craziness and a roster diverse enough to put even Warp to shame, Tigerbeat6 reveals minimalists for the stuffy, gelhaired geeks they truly are. Let's have some music, boys. "}
