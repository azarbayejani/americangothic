{"label":" Downtown","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16711/homepage_large.0bf4f07e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Eric Harvey","artist":"White Denim","title":"D","text":" White Denim telegraphed their entire new album via \"Regina Holding Hands\", from 2009's Fits. \"Regina\" sounded nothing like the skronky, speedaddled garage that had earned the Austin band a deal with RCRD LBL, and a lot more like a leftfield take on airy jazz rock. \"Breezy\" was the last adjective anyone was expecting to use for this band at that point, and the prospect of an full album of such tentative sap would've been enough to trigger the release of the dreaded \"cheese\" descriptor. Yet with their fourth album, D, White Denim double down on this very approach, and manage to make a pretty good LP out of it. How'd they do it? By expanding. First, they grew to a quartet, adding second guitarist Austin Jenkins to their lineup. Second, they dropped some coin on better recording equipment, moving from a trailer to an actual studio. And D is easily White Denim's bestsounding effort yet: The band's trademark shapeshifting compositions now feature clean, interlocking guitar lines, and singer James Petralli's voice has smoothed out into a raspy howl. It's also their most consistent album: Rollicking opener \"It's Him!\" sets the groovy Texas psych template to which the rest of the record hews closely. Along the way, White Denim are able to stir in a new set of psychedelic flourishes see the flutes and hippie lyrical mysticism of \"River to Consider\" with the verve of a Fillmore West opening band. Even the postMaharishi Beatles vibe of closer \"Keys\" complete with strings! feels like a perfect extension of a confident band willing to stretch a bit. Who knows: Maybe it's a teaser for the next album? Personally, I'd prefer White Denim add a bit more choogle to their groove more oomph, a bit more low end to complement D's fresh focus on detail and lateral movement. They certainly have the rhythm section for it, and how great would it be for the album's opening triptych to stir in a little \"Ramble Tamble\"? For now though, this LP's more than good enough. White Denim's inherent restlessness means that all the band's releases feel transitional to a degree, but D's measured restraint points toward the best possible direction for them. "}
