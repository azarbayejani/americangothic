Deusner","artist":"Mittens on Strings","title":"It Is Becomes Disaffect Toward the Present World, Look Up the Sky!!","text":"  Hailing from Kentucky, Mittens on Strings are a funny band, but they're not a jokey band. The laughs on their debut, It Is Becomes Disaffect Toward the Present World, Look Up the Sky!!, catch in your throat as they detail the frustrations of corrupt politicians, extraterrestrials, and indie rock musicians. \"The Most Complete Skeleton Ever Found\", for example, is a standout track sung from the point of view of a tiny dinosaur tormented by larger, fiercer lizards. He lists the bullies with the surly attitude of a dweeby freshman: \"brontosaurus... stegosaurus... dimetrodon... you know they're all just jerks,\" human Alex Preston sings. \"The brontosaurus is only going to fuel a Ford Taurus.\" Longing for the consolation of a museum afterlife, he repeats the line \"all the kids will love me\" as the band pounds out prehistoric broodrock with a dejected lumber, revealing greater depths than the concept might suggest. Mittens on Strings volleys between two seemingly opposite musical poles, neither of which lends itself to much levity. The snareled \"G.I. Dirt Races\", the pityparty starter \"Badge's Folly\", and the mournful, meandering closer \"Last Shot\" churn up collegerock melancholia, with Preston's deep tenor wrenching the songs for maximum mope. \"Enter Mothership\" and \"Confrontation\", on the other hand, saunter by with a lowkey countryrock shamble that incorporates mandolin and pedal steel. One gets the sense the band gravitates to these styles because they're easy to play. That's certainly not a criticism: As their name suggests, Mittens on Strings downplays technical proficiency in favor of a rascally DIY amateurishness that prevents these songs from straying too far into goofy or grave territory. As a result, Look Up the Sky!! manages to create and sustain a brand of irony that somehow implies connection and investment rather than detachment and distance. Mittens on Strings' characters are outsiders who remain sympathetic even as their desperation lends itself to dark humor. On \"G.I. Dirt Races\", a runner sprints so fast that no one can see him cross the finish line. The narrator of \"Confrontation\" dreams of shooting straight maple syrup into his veins to stop his heart. On \"\" (that's the real title), a rejected lover burns the remnants of a relationship, then pees out the fire. Addiction or \"chess with drugs,\" as Preston calls it on \"Badge's Folly\" is a recurring theme, one that sounds realer than fiction. That the band takes these characters and situations seriously lends these songs a considerable gravity, which makes this tonguetwistertitled album familiar yet inventive, smartass yet endearing.  "}
