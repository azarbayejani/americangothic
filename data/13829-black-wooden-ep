{"label":" Southern","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/14866/homepage_large.b647dda8.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Matthew Solarski","artist":"Mount Eerie","title":"Black Wooden EP","text":" Southern Records' Latitudes series bills itself as a collection of \"session recordings capturing the transience and limitless expression of our modern world.\" That claim's a little highflown, but then it suits Phil Elverum, who as the Microphones and now Mount Eerie has made an art of turning the grandiose intimate, and introspective and fleeting moments into something universal and grand. The sixtrack Black Wooden EP marks Mount Eerie's contribution to the series, joining previous releases from fellow leftfield indie luminaries such as Ariel Pink, Sir Richard Bishop, Circle, Magik Markers, and Bohren und der Club of Gore. The premise: set the artist in question up at London's famed Southern Studios where Psychocandy was laid to tape, and where Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, Crass, and Fugazi, among others, have recorded and invite them to craft \"something spontaneous, collaborative, fun, or experimental.\"\"Spontaneity\" is the operative word with Black Wooden. Elverum made these recordings while on tour in summer 2007 (reportedly with a borrowed guitar, no less), and they effectively function as a snapshot of the State of Mount Eerie in the later years of the last decade. Tonesetting opener and title track \"Black Wooden\", on which Elverum spreads spare, ominous natural imagery over a steady strummed pulse, alludes directly to the man's abandoned exercise in inventing a new genre. (\"Black wooden,\" a more \"organic\" variant of black metal though by Wind's Poem Elverum had seemingly given up trying to make the distinction.)\"Appetite\" would soon find a home on said experiment's resulting Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP, albeit buffed up with some of the most ferocious riffage we'd yet heard from Elverum. On that recording the line \"constantly waking up to obliteration\" cues a monsoon of crashing guitars; here, however, Elverum pauses for a beat, inhales, and simply continues with the next line. That the song keeps its solemn momentum is, in a way, heavier than any sixstring thundering. \"If We Knew\" and \"Oh My Heart\" (here known as \"Marriage\", with a partial lyrics sheet makeover) reappear on Lost Wisdom, Elverum's 2008 record with Julie Doiron and Fred Squire. It's interesting to hear Elverum sing the former tune, in particular. The Lost version has Doiron harmonizing with herself, while Elverum's Black Wooden take has him, as ever, sounding like the patron saint of solitudeappropriate for a song clearly born out of the stuff.Speaking of solitude, listening to the Black Wooden EP, as with Lost Wisdom, feels like taking in your own private Mount Eerie concert, complete with the pindropaudible reverent background hushedness that Elverum's gigs tend to inspire. And while most of the record is admittedly about as humorous as the Latitude series tagline, it's not entirely bonedry: \"The Bottomless Pit\" has Elverum following the typical navelgazery of \"Letting it all go, taking it all in/ Which way should I live out my short life?\" with \"meanwhile it all yawns indifferently,\" about as amusing a moment of jokey selfawareness we're liable to get from this guy. And hey, we'll take it.Verdictwise, it goes something like this: If you're a bigtime fan and you bought the super fancy photo book and the singles and the journal, you probably have Black Wooden already. If you've got the collector's itch and phrases like \"limited edition,\" \"nevertobe repeated,\" and \"artisan sleeve motif and insert\" get you giddy, you're definitely in the target demo. And heck, even if you're but an aspiring convert who's reluctant to make a huge commitment, as a welcome mat to the realm of Mount Eerie, you could do much worse. "}
