Schiel","artist":"Bobby Birdman","title":"Let Me In","text":" A party is no place for introspection. Yet, when I'm thrown into an environment surrounded by people, most of whom don't know me, I tend to find a quiet corner. Sure, a party is supposed to be a social gathering, but for whatever reason, I just can't help being lulled into a space where only I exist. Thankfully, Chad Crouch and the crew over at Portland, Oregon's Hush Records have made available a series of records under the \"AntiRock\" banner. Lacking ambition or exuberance, Hush records are perhaps the most conducive records available for those inappropriately introspective moments. And Bobby Birdman's debut is no exception. Bobby Birdman is Rob Kieswetter's stage name, and even sounds like a 1960's throwback sort of pseudonym, which happens to perfectly reflect Birdman's music. Singing of love, ominousness, and being cold, Let Me In reminds one of the Microphones' Phil Elvrum was he to lose his analog fixation and begin toying with a Powerbook. But in traditional Hush form, these electronics are about as subtle as Bj√∂rk's swan dress, remaining calm and atmospheric. Accompanied by simple drum machine loops, a lulling, strummed acoustic guitar, and these inorganic treatments, Birdman's voice resembles a tired Stephen Merritt trading in the throaty tenor for a smoothly delivered, wispy croon. \"I Must Admit That I Love You\" opens the record gently with a manipulated cymbal fadein, which is overtaken by a primitive drum machine line resembling one of those credit card metronomes that were used in my middle school orchestra class. Not that this comes across as silly, but the aura of Let Me In resounds of little ambition and even less groundbreaking. A bassy drone complements Birdman's voice as he moans the album's eponymous line. The melody is sweet and nostalgic, and remains as such throughout the rest of the record. \"Moving On/Up\" and its instrumental counterpart, \"Paradise Dub,\" are based upon decelerated drum loops. An acoustic guitar lazily strums a single chord in time with the percussion, with leads the way for Elvrumesque vocal \"ahh's\" in harmony. \"Moving\" melds into \"Paradise,\" which plays the loop offset with a very subtle reference to the chord progression of the previous track. \"Golden Arms\" follows, an almost a cappella number backed by light backwards guitar lines. The lyrics, once again, draw a line to Elvrum: \"I walked up the hill/ Into the dark/ Out of my body/ I moved undetected.\" \"J Tear\" begins with a gratuitous three minutes of Birdman repeatedly counting out waltztime with some echo manipulations, before fading into another mellow acoustic guitar number. \"Hey Now\" is a gorgeously simple song enshrouded in vocal harmonies, calming down to \"Such an Icy Feeling,\" another quasia cappella track in which the voice clicks from slight electronic manipulation, while quiet drones hum in the background. The record reaches a poppy apex with \"Blue Skies,\" complete with acoustic drums, other people's voices, and a singalong chorus: \"There'll be blue skies/ Nothing but blue skies.\" Yet it never broaches the inyourface border and collapses into a loopedvocal coda, after which Birdman breathes his last moan with the closer, \"Perfect for Light.\" On the whole, Let Me In may bore some with its lack of motivation and the seeming absence of passion, but to me, it seems like Let Me In was created for my wrongplace, wrongtime introspection.
