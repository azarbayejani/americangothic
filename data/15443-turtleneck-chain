{"label":" Universal Republic","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/16554/homepage_large.3aaca3a0.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tom Breihan","artist":"The Lonely Island","title":"Turtleneck & Chain","text":" When the Lonely Island's parodic viral rap anthem \"I'm on a Boat\" snagged a Grammy nomination in 2009, guest singer TPain expressed a bit of confusion: This thing was a lark, a skit for \"Saturday Night Live\" and (maybe more to the point) for YouTube, and here it is, getting one of the highest honors TPain will probably ever get. In \"We're Back!\", the opening track of their sophomore album, Turtleneck & Chain, Lonely Island member Jorma Taccone points out how weird that was: \"Lonely Island! Grammy nominated!\" this right after Andy Samberg raps about how his dick looks like \"the fat that you cut off a steak.\" \"We're Back!\" is an absurd, overblown take on the intro to every selfaggrandizing blockbuster rap album ever, but Turtleneck & Chain could well outsell plenty of the stuff it spoofs. Ridiculous as it may be, these guys are now something resembling pop stars. And no 2011 album has a list of guests as starstudded as this one: Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Akon. They may be fake rappers, but real rappers don't have that kind of pull anymore. And since they're pop stars now, the Lonely Island face a familiar problem on Turtleneck & Chain: How do you follow up a big debut album without just repeating all the same tricks? These guys are, after all, \"Saturday Night Live\" employees, and repeating tricks is what \"Saturday Night Live\" does. Turtleneck & Chain brings back a few characters from debut album Incredibad: Shy Ronnie, the \"Dick in the Box\" guys. And, for the most part, it recycles what made Incredibad work. The Lonely Island guys make jokes out of rap music but do it without mocking the genre, putting lifetimes of fandom in service of absurdist jokes that get progressively more absurd as the songs go on, bringing their superstar guests along for the ride. Michael Bolton, for instance, just kills his bit on \"Jack Sparrow\", wailing his absurdly catchy dorkedout moviefan chorus and refusing to let the Lonely Island people stick with their boring club jam. Lesser comics would've just made fun of Michael Bolton's past; on this album, he actually gets something to do. Of course, \"Jack Sparrow\" had a funnyashell video on \"Saturday Night Live\", and it doesn't play as well without its visuals. That's a problem here. Of the tracks that already appeared on \"SNL\", some of them work just fine on their own, like the infectiously joyous Akon collab \"I Just Had Sex\" or \"Threw It on the Ground\", a devastating but affectionate skewering of Dead Prez/Immortal Techniquestyle conspiracytheory rap. Others, like \"Shy Ronnie 2: Ronnie & Clyde\", are visual jokes that just don't make any sense without their videos, though it definitely helps that a DVD of those videos comes with the CD. The nonTV tracks generally don't hold up as well, but it's fun to match them up with their inspirations. \"Rocky\", for example, pushes the alreadyjokey premise of DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince's \"I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson\" to gory extremes, and \"Trouble on Dookie Island\" turns the breathless crime narrative of something like Ghostface Killah's \"Shakey Dog\" into a grossout joke by having its desperate thug narrators shit themselves over and over and over. Throughout Turtleneck & Chain, the Lonely Island play around way more with dick and shit jokes than they did on their first album and for a group whose first massive success already had the word \"dick\" in its title, that's saying something. Some of it is absolutely terrible; the \"Falcor vs. Atreyu\" skit, in which Neverending Story characters fuck each other, is obnoxious enough to clear out a room at a Wolf Eyes show, and the intentionally annoying \"Japan\" hits its mark a little too well. For the most part, though, these are good songs with jokes in them, not jokes with songs attached. An album full of fake rap, famouspeople cameos, and scatological jokes shouldn't have any replay value whatsoever, but Turtleneck & Chain holds up awfully well, partly because the music is almost always, at the very least, listenable, and partly because the jokes depend more on earwormy hooks and absurdities spinning out of control than on simple punchlines. The guest stars here all give some indication of why they're stars; Nicki Minaj's verse on \"The Creep\", for example, is just a great Nicki guest verse. (The Lonely Island guys themselves don't rap or sing anywhere near as well as their guests, but they're sketch comics and writers, not pop stars, so we can cut them some slack.) And even if these songs work best as \"SNL\" sketches, they should still work nicely on your next road trip. "}
