Sometimes they disappear because they're made to disappear. In the case of raï, Algeria's vibrant hybrid of Middle Eastern and European folk, its subject matter and party vibe often made the music a target in postcolonial Algeria, with former FLN fighter and later the nation's Marxist leader Houari Boumédienne not as huge a fan of free speech as he was of suppressing it. Of course, raï never vanished. Every bit the people's music as much as punk or hiphop, raï had flourished for decades before the government brought the hammer down and even then it merely moved underground; it's from those years that Sublime Frequencies' vinylonly 1970's Algerian ProtoRaï Underground compiles (thanks to Hicham Chadly) eight festive horn (and, in one case, electric guitar) adorned tracks from four Algerian acts.These rough hewn recordings sound like they were surreptitiously recorded at some wedding or street party, full as they are of pounding percussion, bleating brass, humming organ or accordion, and fullthroated Arabic vocals. Translations of the titles reveal a quotidian truth to the songs: Bellemou & Benfissa's \"Li Maandouche L'Auto\", for example, translates roughly to \"He Who Doesn't Own a Car\" (it's about drunk driving, and features \"Father of Raï\" Messaoud Bellemou, whose L'Orchestre Bellemou updated many traditional Algerian melodies for modern ears). Boutaiba Sghir's \"Dayha Oulabes\" is perhaps more universally resonant as \"I'll Marry Her Whether They Like It or Not\", while Groupe El Azhar's \"Mazal Nesker Mazal\" becomes the remarkably descriptive \"I'm Still Getting Drunk...Still\". Cheb Zergui's \"Ana Dellali\" means, straightforwardly enough, \"I Cuddle Myself\". The late70s track \"Ana Dellali\" is the most striking track on the comp, given its psychedelic wahwah guitar and dubwise bass. The rest of the set is more slice of life. Culled from longforgotten 45s, this collection plays like a snapshot of what one imagines might have been found performed in cabarets or blaring in a some backroom Oran jukebox when the long arm of the law was looking the other way. Given the subsequent global spread of raï and the international success of several bona fide raï stars, archivists, DJs and treasure hunters would be wise to dispatch their best vinyl hounds to the city forthright, in search of more gems likes these, just waiting to be dusted off and discovered anew.
