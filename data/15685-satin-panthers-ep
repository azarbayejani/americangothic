{"label":" Warp","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/16810/homepage_large.8a07e64a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Hudson Mohawke","title":"Satin Panthers EP","text":" Hudson Mohawke's recent output a bonkers remix of Wiley's \"Electric Boogaloo\", a handful of decent edits on his Soundcloud has been enough to catch relatively highprofile ears. Not long ago, the Glasgow producer (real name: Ross Birchard) received a ridiculously glowing Twitter shoutout from hiphop headknocker Just Blaze, and Chris Brown jumped on an old HudMo track. Still, in a way it's surprising Mohawke has received any level of popularity beyond beat freaks and Warp rostercheckers. His 2009 debut LP, Butter, didn't exactly flow like the melted yellow stuff; it was an unfocused mix of futureR&B pastiche and jumbled funk experimentation. Good thing for second chances. Mohawke's new Satin Panthers EP shows the kind of improvement that a couple of years in the lab will do for you. His music is still jumbledsounding, but rather than being sneakily complicated, this record is obviously so; the fact it all works so well is the sneaky part. Mohawke packs in oodles of genre and artistspecific tics: the hardhitting repetition of Chicago juke, the sharp melodic tang of Bristol's \"purple\" scene, the sticky swarm of Los Angelesera Flying Lotus, the lightcycle chaos of hiphop producer Lex Luger, and the galloping rhythms of UK funky. Which might sound like the recipe for a total mess, except HudMo combines every ingredient expertly. One complaint: The EP's 17minute run time feels too brief. Luckily, Satin Panthers offers more than enough to tide listeners over until a potential followup album, whether the doubleoctave bass line on \"Thunder Bay\" or the building synth spirals on \"Octan\". The closing track, a burst of marchingband mania, is called \"Thank You\", but when all's said and done, there's a lot of gratitude to go around here. "}
