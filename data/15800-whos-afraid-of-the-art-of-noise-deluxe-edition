It's easy to see why the group would be proud of such lustrous descendants, but it actually sells them short. What's interesting about Art of Noise certainly the first phase of their project, which culminated in this debut album isn't so much their children but their parents. This was a pop band named after a 1913 art manifesto, deliberately aspiring to inherit the explosion of early 20th century conceptual creativity and make Futurists and Dadaists rub shoulders with bboys and clubbers. The group's own archconceptualist, music writer Paul Morley, apparently planned an album that would be a grand collage of the century's sounds what he actually got was an acrimonious split. Morley may, in his words, have only \"made the tea\" in Art of Noise, but he dominates the visual half of this reissue: introducing videos, reading out essays onstage, continually playing the ideas man and provocateur even if his incessant wordplay's an acquired taste. The group's videos are proof that this apparent pretension came with a smart payoff. \"Beat Box\" is recast as the soundtrack to a city with lively, evocative footage of 1980s London cut to its rhythm. \"Moments in Love\" mixes dancers and tortoises, grace and absurdity. And most famously \"Close (to the Edit)\", the dreamlogic realization of the group's ideals, with a creepy punker kid commanding anonymous wreckers as they smash cellos and pianos to pieces. \"Close (to the Edit)\" reminds you that Art of Noise were trying to be funny and sometimes scary neither of them standard pop ambitions in 1984 or now. In fact, what's striking about this album is the range of moods and effects it musters, while remaining an intensely playful record. It follows the savage, martial arrangement of Cold War bricolage \"A Time for Fear (Who's Afraid)\" with a teasing version of \"Beat Box\" where the track's purposeful electro keeps getting diverted by shiny new sounds. On the title track, a snooty voice asks, \"Can I say something?\" and the music refuses to let it even say that, gleefully slashing the sample to ribbons. The album flirts with annoyance and even boredom the way the stately, repetitive beauty of \"Moments in Love\" lulls you before unwinding itself into stranger places. But they could also be thrilling. Their immediate context was hiphop, but their kind of funk best experienced on \"Close (to the Edit)\" has a brash rigor to it, calling to mind tireless pistons and marching feet. \"This limited circle of pure sounds must be broken,\" Luigi Russolo wrote in the manifesto that inspired the band, \"and the infinite variety of noisesound conquered.\" But the technological limits to sampling in 1984 meant that Art of Noise were stuck with a very finite variety of noisesound, constantly worrying at and reusing snippets of samples. The only problem with the many reissues of early Art of Noise is the group's endless recycling of its two key tracks. \"Beat Box\" of which \"Close (to the Edit)\" is a cousin and \"Moments in Love\" were on their first EP, then issued as separate singles, appeared on every compilation, dominated this debut album, and now appear counting the DVD six times each on this reissue. For diehard fans, the incessant tinkering is part of the fun for listeners less caught up in the band's process, it's easy to get a little weary with the radio sessions and alternate video edits collected here. Stick with the core album and videos, though, and you realize the reason Art of Noise kept returning to these songs: Both are superb, anchoring a record that's as sly, stirring, and occasionally infuriating now as it was on release.
