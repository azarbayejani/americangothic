We know she has it in her, because she's let her cards show once with \"Cold Cold Water\", an unhinged, vertiginous, epic single that easily oneupped The Flaming Lips in orchestral bombast and yet remained intimate as a whisper. That song was a revelation; I feel reasonably safe claiming that it sounded like nothing anyone had recorded before, save Ennio Morricone as the obvious influence. Shockingly, Mirah and her producercumMicrophonesbandmate Phil Elvrum blew right past their own brilliance the rest of that album (2002's Advisory Committee) pingponged listlessly from coffeehouse folk to rickety lofi electro and back.So, does this new offering from Mirah deliver on that semiaccidental promise? As you can probably glean from its somewhat unwieldy billing and workmanlike title, it's not meant to. It's a 28minute sound collage that nestles five or six songs among freeform instrumentals, unprocessed ideas and found sounds. Songs from the Black Mountain comes weighted with tons of extraneous circumstance Mirah recorded it with her friend Ginger Brooks Takahashi during a 30day stay in a mountain town, presumably on portable equipment; its proceeds go to charities like the Rock'n'Roll Camp for Girls. In short, this record all but begs not to be judged as a proper album.I don't know what's at the root of this need to bury songs in ephemera, but it's beginning to look a lot like fear of responsibility. I hated wading through the muck of The Microphones' Song Islands for morsels of Elvrum's wan songwriting; solo Mirah at her best is so much better than Elvrum that it makes her worst that much more frustrating. To demonstrate what I mean, let's just get it over with and divide the album in two segments which, for easier reference, we'll call \"songs\" and \"other shit.\"Songs:\"The Knife Thrower\": a gently perverse torch ballad reminiscent of Advisory Committee's \"The Garden\" and \"Light the Match\", wonderfully packed with such antique locutions as \"lark\" and \"asunder.\"\"Life You Love\": a surprisingly straightfaced bluegrass number, with stuttering banjo on a bed of languid lap steel, and both women on vocals.\"Pure\": a minimal yet powerful melody built around one heartbreaking chord change, a whispery incantation of \"give in\" and precisely applied touches of ambiance both natural and industrial. The album's tentpole.\"Rock of Ages\": sung a capella, aside from a couple of fleeting piano chords, with the friends' voices double and tripletracked into a complicated choral arrangement.\"Oh! September\": pure fun, with doowop vocals that actually go \"doowop,\" and an honesttogoodness surf guitar. Somewhat reminiscent of her recent brilliant Ragazza Pop compilation contribution, \"Don't\". A special bonus for rhyming \"baby\" with \"ukulele.\"Other Shit:\"Lil' Bit\": a minute of guitar noodling.\"Birdy Noises\": noises akin to those made by birds.\"Plink Plink Plink\": as advertised.\"The Red Curtain\": actually quite decent, with Eastern chimes and a jerky accordion.\"The Party\": steel drums over a static cello riff.\"Noisy Groove\": 21 seconds of backwards noise.\"Plink Plink\": not to be confused with \"Plink Plink Plink\". Actually, go ahead.\"Broken Mirah\": a tape loop.\"Acoustic Groove\": guitar, timidly plucked.\"Horny Groove\": alas, a pun on \"horns.\"\"Squocky Groove\": a blaring sax.\"Buggy Noises\": noises akin to those made by bugs.I believe it goes without saying that, for Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn, coming up with that great album will be a matter of subtraction, not addition.Â  "}
