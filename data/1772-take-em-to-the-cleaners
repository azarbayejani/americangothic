While the successes of 50 Cent and Joe Budden prove that mixtapes are often exceptionally effective means of publicity, these compilations are never held to the same standards as full albums. Poor production, thematic inconsistencies, and shouting DJs (\"DJ CLUECLUECLUE!! NEW SHIT!!\") plague the mixtape medium, and as such, the tapes are better served as public sparring grounds than as careerdefining releases. So why bother reviewing the mixtape of Tribe's other member, Consequence, well after his apex on Beats, Rhymes, Life? Well, maybe some of us wanted to know what Kanye West does on the weekends, when he's not milling Jesusfaced bling. In a move reminiscent of the Puff Daddy parasitism of the mid90s, Kanye West has assumed the lucrative tripartite role of rapper, publicist, and/or producer for every artist he works with. He even commissions his artistsintraining for cameo appearances on any other project that falls in his lap (check cohort John Legend's background appearances on JayZ's \"Encore\", Talib's \"GetBy\" and Dilated Peoples' \"This Way\"). Kanye West had been a major player on the mix circuit well before the release of his College Dropout album early this year, and he still favors the medium for dropping exclusive remixes and oneoffs. It's win/win for all involved: West maintains a fresh public fa√ßade, and his Kon Man Crew is given the chance to shine. Take 'Em to the Cleaners may be listed as a Consequence release, but Cons plays a far smaller role here than that implies. This is really West's album: He designed the set, assigned the parts, and wrote the play.Cleaners opens with Kanye at his kick/snarepopping best on \"So Soulful\", his best offRocafella production to date. From its Jackson 5 guitar loop to John Legend's pleasant peripherals to Consequence's percolating flow, the track brims with the energy and effervescence of a latesummer classic. And when \"Soulful\"'s momentum fades during the two following tracks, Cons and company come back hard with the perilously talentstuffed \"Wack Niggas\", a longtime staple of West's mixtapes that shows the multifaceted talents of Kanye, Common, Talib Kweli, and Cons meshing beautifully, throwing punches at fake thugs in Chrysler Sebrings over vaudevillian horns and tiptoeing strings. Especially in contrast to Kanye's solid, idiosyncratic production, Consequence seems wary of his talents. It's not that West is relegating Cons to the sidelines; rather, Cons benches himself. On \"Yard 2 Yard\", he cracks: \"Moved from a neverquitewas to an overnightbuzz/ 'Cuz the way I flip a metaphor, nobody quite does,\" yet rarely makes any real attempt to support this claim (let alone to establish himself as the marquee performer). Other times, he just embarrasses himself: Check the offkey warbling and questionable refrain of \"Trains\": \"You should be my queen/ But the only thing I can do is treat you like a slut.\" Thankfully, Consequence does provide at least a brief glimpse of his ability. While he only manages to trade two stanzas with Little Brother's Big Pooh on the 9th Wonderproduced album highlight \"I See Now\", his catcalls are surprisingly slick: \"It's like a college degree when you're following me/ Without the entry level job, just a modeling fee.\" Two of the better cuts also prove to be safer territory for Consequence, who gives confident performances over a snappy adaptation of Souls of Mischief's \"'93 'Til Infinity\" and the Tribe rerelease \"The Consequence\", featuring Con's cousin QTip. Despite this apparent identity crisis, however, Consequence legitimately shines against the chirping flutes on \"And You Say\", intimating his former glory as ATCQ's junior member. In the end, these flashes of lyrical finesse are all the more frustrating: Even after an entire Consequence album, we still don't know who we're listening to. Take 'Em to the Cleaners is less of a breakout for Kanye's sidekick than a draft of his potential success, and another stitch in Kanye's red bear sweater. If and/or when Quence's major label solo debut is ever released (it's been tied up in the record industry's Red Tape District for almost a decade), it should be interesting to see if he can prove his height when he's not standing on Kanye's shoulders.
