For now, the Bpitch Control labelhead seems to have taken a break from the boards, making 2004 both a year for administration the label has issued more LPs and 12inches this year than any before and, in the cases of her new Remix Collection and DJ mix My Parade, a year for archival and personal introspection as well. \"Personal\" is used somewhat broadly here. To a large extent, Allien is Bpitch Control, and the label maintains such a distinct identity, despite its growing roster of new artists, precisely because her own trajectory dominates. And so My Parade lays out Bpitch's prehistory as much as Allien's: the beats 'n' breaks tradition of early 90s UK techno. Allien identifies with some familiar tracks Midi Rain's 1991 track \"Always\" kicks off the mix with dense synth melodies and a fierce (though somewhat dated) 16thnote drum loop, and Plaid's 2001 offering \"Squance\" is a nice throwback to the group's early singles but curiously spends a lot of time spinning Bsides. If Allien was looking to align herself with early 90s Warp, the Blueprint mix of Wild Planet's \"Electron\" does not seem the most definitive choice. Then again, this is not The Parade, but My Parade, and perhaps Allien pays tribute to these artists not simply as her influences, but as artists themselves: Bsides often house the more difficult or experimental offerings of 12inch releases, and by using them so exclusively in My Parade (10 of the album's 13 tracks are flips), Allien might be nodding to what she considers her tradition's more introspective releases. The new Bpitch releases that Allien includes on My Parade, however, are not presented as UK techno's most highly evolved specimen. Instead, Allien stuffs them together in the middle of the mix, as if to tease out Bpitch's debt even more graphically. Allien's \"Bang Bang\", like the front side of My Parade, is more rhythmically than melodically interested, as the track convulses in a stew of percussive sounds. Modeselektor's \"Rave Anthem\" follows, though into slightly more melodic terrain. Apparat's schaffel gem \"Cheap Thrills\", however, stands out from the Bpitch pack, clamoring limply through a storm of noise and fat rain. After this brief Bpitch showcase, the heretofore dark and gloomy My Parade finishes out with a string of bright instrumentals. Allien pays particular tribute to CJ Bolland's 1992 bright trance anthem \"Mantra\" by following it with her own Plaiddoestrance number \"Dresden\", one of her earliest releases. If My Parade is Allien's frank homage to her influences, Remix Collection proves how distinct of an identity she has developed despite those debts. The compilation chronicles much of Allien's career, from her 1996 heavy house remix of GutHumpe's \"Butterfly\" to a 2003 reconfiguration of Berlinette leadoff \"Alles Sehen\". Much like Matthew Herbert's 2002 remix album Secondhand Sounds, Allien's Remix Collection works well as an album precisely because each remix so clearly bears her fingerprints: particularly her uncompromisingly dark, rhythmic displacements of source material. Allien's reworking of Sascha Funke's \"Forms and Shapes\" understands the melancholy that neither the original nor any other of the song's several remixes could fully grasp, while her take on Gold Chains' \"Let's Get It On\" proves that she knows when to lay off a bit the song's memorable vocal and synth hooks remain completely intact. Same goes for French duo OMR's \"The Way We Have Chosen\": Allien maintains the original's key \"Here Come the Warm Jets\" guitar melodies, and concentrates her influence in the song's breakdown, which even features her own glitchedout vocals.Remix Collection's most historically popular cuts the remixes of Barbara Morgenstern's \"Aus Heiterem Himmel\" and of Golden Boy with Miss Kittin's \"Rippin Kittin\" are unsurprisingly the album's brightest spots, too. The sheer vitality of Allien's Morgenstern remix flatout embarrasses the loungey, Gainsbourgeous original, while Allien's subtle enhancements to the electrosnorter \"Rippin Kittin\" give the song's hook (\"Daddy/ Can I go out and kill tonight?/ I feel/ I feel like taking a life\") remarkable chill. It's a wonder people didn't feel more awkward dancing to Allien's version (the remix was a relative club hit in 2002), but that's further testament to Allien's talent: Given both its tact and personal energy, Remix Collection could just as accurately been titled My Parade, too.
