What happened to Bristol's most famous cultural export, a sound that teased listeners with impressions of Majorera urban Britain as a Blade Runner fantasy? In the days when Tricky, Massive Attack, and Portishead were heralded as the town's mavericks, the music seemed to be a fine cosmopolitan blues for the early 90s recession. Hiphop beats that wander the streets every night to find God, basslines that hiss from soundsystems bloodied from a decade of tear, and Hollywood's spectacle of \"noir\" all mourned utopian visions discarded by pragmatism and fashion sense. Cynics framed the genre's death certificate, dated September 29, 1998 when UNKLE's Psyence Friction was released to tin ears and demoralized souls. But in an age when hiphop productions can sound drycleaned, some elements of triphop are still missed.Retrospective, a greatesthits, bsides, and rarities collection from Smith & Mighty, could further mystify the genre. Producers Rob Smith and Ray Mighty helped import hiphop into the city during the early 80s with their Three Stripes Sound System, which mixed soul, dub, and funk that helped catalyze the \"Bristol Sound.\" Later that decade, they won a cult hit by giving that treatment to Burt Bacharach's \"Walk On By\" and Massive Attack's first single, \"Any Love\" (1988). S&M; didn't release their own album until 1995's Bass Is Maternal, and later garnered sleeper success on !K7's DJ Kicks series. So what do Smith & Mighty's Retrospective tracks now mean to you and your family? Well it depends on how you adjust your stereo. If the volume is muffled to dentist officelevel and the bass is removed, then you'll get some snazzy'n'chic beats and diva operas for your next visit to JCPenney's. But if your subwoofers are cranked loud enough to strike a dozen neighborhood watch alerts, then Smith & Mighty uncannily translate British R&B; and soul to the cardboardmatted dancefloor. For instance, the opener, \"Come On Back\" sung by feted chanteuse Carlton could either be a dublite AOR tune or a bassbruised, Trenchtown soliloquy. The dependence on drum machines and synths unfortunately date and trap most of the music in the late 80s. The highlights inculde the S&Mproduced; 1989 UK hit by Funk 4, \"Wishing On a Star\", with its sample of James Brown's timeless \"Funky Drummer\". Other high points include the dubjungle space out, \"Move You Run (Blue & Red Mix)\", and dancehall toaster Niji's boasting of his speakerbox to a drum'n'bass strut in \"B Line Fine Blow\". But nothing on Retrospective is as radical or abstract enough as albums by fellow Bristolians like, say, Massive Attack's Blue Lines or Portishead's Dummy. The mysteries are absent it's up to historians and nostalgists to create new ones. "}
