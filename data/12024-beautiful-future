{"label":" Warner Bros.","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/12144/homepage_large.cb05b23d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stuart Berman","artist":"Primal Scream","title":"Beautiful Future","text":" At the turn of 90s, Primal Scream were one of the first groups to transform themselves from a conventional rock band into a production team. Breaking down traditional instrumental roles, the band became studio silly putty, collaborating with any number of producers. It's a concept that's since been embraced by the likes of Radiohead and the Flaming Lips, but where those groups have taken a studious, sciencelab approach to their experimentalism, Primal Scream still project a venerable image of rock'n'roll hedonism. They unapologetically celebrate (and occasionally decry) their chemical consumption in song, mouth off in the press about crap bands and evil politicians, and load up their videos with Kate Moss cameos. Taken as a whole, Primal Scream's scattershot, trendspotting discography doesn't so much represent a search for new sounds as a search for the best drugs: ecstasy (1991's epochal acidhouse address Screamadelica), weed (1997's dubtronic odyssey Vanishing Point), speed (2000's explosive XTRMNTR), coke (2002's totally wired Evil Heat), and whatever horrific substance deludes them into releasing a Rolling Stones knockoff every 12 years (1994's Give Out But Don't Give Up, 2006's Riot City Blues).Beautiful Future is an especially rich title coming from a band with such a sloppy past, but its concise, laserfocussed 10song tracklist bearing the popgolden touch of producers Paul Epworth (Bloc Party, the Rapture) and Bjorn Yttling (Peter Bjorn and John, Lykke Li) suggests Primal Scream's latest high is sobriety. The opening title track features the most joyous, clearheaded melody they've sung since Screamadelica's \"Movin' on Up\", but in a much different dressing. Here, their Exileera Stones influence yields to the cheeky glam of Sparks, from the jaunty piano riff, hand claps and ascending chorus, to Bobby Gillespie's wry commentary on middleclass privilege: \"Congratulations/ You're living the dream/ In the dead heart of the control machine.\" The lyric may read like a typically agitated Gillespie spiel, but since assuming the role of technopunk provocateurs on XTRMNTR in retrospect, a prescient antiBush/Blair manifesto Primal Scream's music has turned less pointedly political; rather than wage a carpetbomb attack on governmental institutions, Beautiful Future seeks to serve those who live under their rule, seeming more sympathetic to the notion of materialism as escapism.Military references are either deployed playfully (the \"gas chambers\" on \"Beautiful Future\" standing in for a culture choking on overconsumption) or lazily (\"Suicide Bomb\" being a cheap, rippedfromtheheadlines metaphor for goin' crazy), but even in the latter instance, the selfimmolating image is followed by Gillespie declaring, \"I see the beauty in everything.\" So it's fitting that Beautiful Future, musically, is drawn to the allure of cool, shimmering surfaces: \"Can't Go Back\" retrofits the brutalizing guitar holocaust of XTRMNTR's \"Accelerator\" as slick, Korgcrazed new wave, while the \"Billie Jean\" beat and Italodisco sheen of \"Uptown\" glosses over its workingclassheroic chorus, positioning the band as unlikely but eager elder statesmen to the nuromantic electro of Sam Sparro and Calvin Harris.In a sense, Beautiful Future finds Primal Scream turning into the sort of bright, bouncy 80s pop band they initially stood in opposition to. And yet, the transition is pulled off with such guileless enthusiasm and steely precision that the midalbum drift back to ultraviolet stoner/psych dirge (\"Suicide Bomb\", \"Beautiful Summer\") feels like an unnecessary regression better left to the likes of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the Brian Jonestown Massacre. But the group also stumbles when they force the fun: The woeful \"Zombie Man\" repurposes several Screamadelica signifiers, but squanders them all on a stupid, sorethumb chorus chant (\"Hey hey zombie man/ Gonna put you in a can\").Fortunately, the record's weak center stretch is redeemed by a great closing trifecta that again finds Primal Scream putting their farreaching Rolodex to use: CSS' Lovefoxxx trades cool comeons with Gillespie on the evilheated \"I Love to Hurt (You Love to Be Hurt)\", which sounds like the Plastic Ono Band rager \"I Found Out\" given an Ed Banger remix; an elegiac, Linda Thompsonassisted cover of the Fleetwood Mac Tusk track \"Over and Over\" effectively fills Primal Scream's onesoulballadperalbum quota; and though Josh Homme doesn't actually sing on the closing \"Necro Hex Blues\", his presence is made obvious by the song's relentless, motorikmetal pulse, giving the band's longstanding Stooges fetish a 21stcentury makeover. Much like Screamadelica's acidrock/acidhouse crossover nearly 20 years ago, Beautiful Future proposes an equally unlikely union between Primal Scream's traditional leatherjacketed indie/Britpop base and today's neoncapped, bottleserviced club kids. And if this attempted reconciliation produces moments of both elation and frustration, well, the band's erratic track record gives us no real reason to expect otherwise. "}
