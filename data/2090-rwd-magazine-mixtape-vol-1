{"label":" RWD","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/2073/homepage_large.9111fbf9.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jess Harvell","artist":"Various Artists","title":"RWD Magazine Mixtape Vol. 1","text":" Logan Sama grabs the mic at the beginning of this mix to tell us that he's \"the best I am at what I do.\" He tells us several more times throughout. What he does is DJ grime on venerable London pirate radio station Rinse FM. So why is dude so full of hubris? Well, a lot of people credit him with bringing the vocal anthem back to the scene after a long stretch of instrumental singles designed for MCs to spit over live. And he's been one of the DJs pushing the r&g; (that's rhythm & grime) sound (about which more later) that many others credit with pulling the scene back from near total darkness and, well, grime. Oh, and he's managed to beg, borrow, or steal more than three dozen anthems, exclusives, and freestyles to put together what amounts to, as he sez, the best grime mixtape ever. So I think he's earned his talkover intrusions. (My only request, if he ever reads this, is that he get his own version of the DJ Clue/Kayslay/et al explosion FX, preferably a giant bell sound, รก la Big Ben.) With 40 tracks in 80 minutes, Sama doesn't waste much time lingering over pretty melodies, extended beat sections, or even second verses in most cases. Like a Jamaican selector or the friend you haven't seen for a while with a clutch of new music to play you, he's slamming from one cool part of a track to the next and fuck letting it play until it gets boring. (Derrick May and Larry Levan would not be pleased.) The result, at least for the first half, seems to ratchet up the intensity with each new track. There's Kano's \"P's & Q's\", a track that doesn't feel like an anthem the first 300 times, but then he says \"slippin\" in that lazy menace way of his for the 301st and you can almost hear it. The Mitchell Brothers' \"Routine Check\" is \"99 Problems\" relocated to Hobbiton with another slurryofporridgeoutofthecornerofhismouth cameo from Mike Skinner. (Sounding more than ever out of step with \"proper grime\" and better for it.) Track of the mix, if I was forced to choose with the bamboo shoots at the ready, is Dogzilla's \"Hallo\". Produced by Danny Weed, it's got the big, fuckoff stadium drums we've come to expect (Bonham on a lean) and some pretty vicious guitar stabs and of course I am going to be sympathetic to any song which contains the command \"kiss my fat, white arse.\" Jammer proves he's not just looking like Lil Jon these days with the shouty \"Merkle Man\", followed by even more Danny Weed bathysphere booms on Roll Deep's \"When I'm 'Ere\", this time with extra accordion. I still have my reservations about the middle r&g; section however. While I appreciate that it's getting the ladies back in the clubs, something still feels cheap about putting r&b; vocals over a grime instrumental and calling it a new genre. It's produced a handful of amazing tunes, but sometimes it just sounds like 2step with some new noises or (worse) British r&b.; Now I'm getting my xenophobia and my masculine bias on, but if grime is the British reponse to rap, then they got a ways to go before they work up a comparable response for soul. (Okay, okay, fine. I am being too harsh. In six months I probably won't even feel the same way. I hated Kano's \"What Have You Done?\" and now I think it's a masterpiece. Caveat emptor.) But then, wooo! He rallies with an extended outro of bangers, like the amazing throwback UKG of SLK's \"Hype! Hype!\" featuring maybe the most exuberant vocals any grime MC has yet spit. (Sticky productions always have great vocals...come home, Lady Stush!) Grime is great! So here's my request for the rest of the summer. No more articles about whether it's going to break the U.S. rap market (it hasn't even really broken the UK), no more whining it hasn't broken out from the hipster ghetto in the U.S., no more sociological treatise or attempts at your thesis. Enjoy the records as is. I don't care how you do it. Pretend they are transmission from Pluto. Or Sublime Frequencies is putting them out. Leave the \"state of grime\"/\"future of grime\" to the eventual history books. Grime is great!! "}
