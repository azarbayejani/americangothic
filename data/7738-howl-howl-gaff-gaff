Though it's harsh and reductive to label them \"the emo Strokes\", it's also true: These romantics may bring a muchneeded, heartonsleeve honesty to the tooserious underground, but they're riding a pale horse. Twee ebullience generally indicates a Pacific Northwestern pedigree; Love as Laughter, for example, ran pretty much the same sound up the flagpole in 2001, which we at Pitchfork saluted, rallying around its perfect opener \"Coast to Coast\". The inspired proposition of Cars keyboards and Built to Spill guitars on Howl Howl Gaff Gaff's \"The Comeback\" made me eager, and defenseless against the heartswelling chorus of \"Very Loud\". Wiping the mist from my eyes after the umpteenth fullvolume blast of its chorus (\"Little by little/ You're gonna hear me cry\"), I nervously let the album play through, not wanting to leave the springtime embrace it welcomed me with. No music, no event I can imagine, even now a Dear John email, Japanese noisecore could have stifled the boundless opening daydreams of Howl Howl Gaff Gaff as dramatically as \"Shut Your Eyes\", a loathsome, spedup perjury of The Strokes' \"The Modern Age\" that drives home the downside of the band's shameless romanticism. It's only rock 'n' roll to them. \"Screw continuity,\" I thought, and frantically scanned the record for that first feeling. Where did it go? How can you have it and lose it in 30 seconds? Sadly, the band seem to be asking the same question, as their only other moment of transcendence, the closing \"My Friend and the Ink on His Fingers\" is a decelerated reworking of \"Very Loud\". Dejected and emotionless, I resigned myself to plowing through the rest of Howl Howl Gaff Gaff, knowing I'd been somewhere I could never revisit. Thankfully, it doesn't get worse than \"Shut Your Eyes\"; the opening Travis chords of their new single \"Please Please Please\" don't lead into any Britpop bleating. A subdued romp, the track's hardpanned, clean Stratocasters nonetheless reek of their shambling NYC predecessors, and I'm hardpressed to think of anyone else they could have been inspired by. Their bio broadcasts Grandaddy and Elf Power, which, given the occasional use of vibes, makes some sense, but they go on to invoke The Stone Roses and The Cure, betraying that whatever The Shout Out Louds have in mind is a bit beyond their reach right now. \"100Â°\", their first single, dates from 2002, and cops the only Cure move you'll hear on the album a lead keyboard but you're as likely to think you're listening to old Modest Mouse (and by that I mean Sad Sappy Sucker) during its chorus. The stumbling, fragmentary plods \"There's Nothing\" and \"Wish I Was Dead\", both dressed up in xylophone and Elf Power guitar tones, are in huge contrast to the rest of the album, solid evidence that after just over a year together, the band are still figuring things out. Energetic, perhaps to a fault, The Shout Out Louds seem destined to fade into memory once their romance with pop music ends, and there's no fire extinguisher for that spark like a jaded American or British audience sighing through the next big thing. Recent dates in NYC weren't disasters, but like any band, The Shout Out Louds' existence is dependent on their ability to suspend disbelief, and I don't know how long they can keep that up. As a better man with two first names once said, you gotta have faith. "}
