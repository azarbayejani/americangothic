Quit +/or Fight may lack the immediate melodic punch of the band's debut it forsakes pristine strums for skewering electric guitar and scrappier arrangements but what the record sacrifices in warmth, it makes up for in atmospherics. Quit +/or Fight is Holopaw's first Christmas record, alternately sweet and grim, an impeccable homage to snow and weird, wintry disembodiment. These songs are dark and cold, and their August release sent squirting out into an expanse of rotting, hundredplus days, drifting over boiled trash and limp, floppy gardens proves oddly apt. All the chills you'll feel will finally do some good. Holopaw's juxtapositions may be less striking now, but the results are more cohesive. Still, Quit takes a little extra time to settle into: Without being purposefully difficult, Quit +/or Fight can still be willfully (and successfully) obtuse, scrappy and determinably distanced from the shiny perfection of Holopaw. Since 2003, the band has added another guitar player (Tom Reno of Florida postrockers the Mercury Program), and with members currently scattered from their former home base of Gainesville, FL, Holopaw has adopted the increasingly popular U.S.P.S. method of sound recording, drifting ideas back and forth from producer Mike Pecchio's studio in BedStuy, Brooklyn to Philadelphia, Florida, and elsewhere. Whimsical and charmingly slack, Quit +/or Fight harnesses that distance to create a record intensely sympathetic to gaps in place and time. Opener \"Losing Light\" is all pause and thumping drums, punctuated by prickly guitar lines and overdubbed vocals singer/lyricist John Orth (also of Isaac Brock sideproject Ugly Cassanova) encapsulates late December with awkward, crushing intimacy, his voice drifting from halfwhisper to fullsong: \"The tree from the house to the curb/ Tinsel pathways to the yard...We're losing light/ The holiday, whittled down to this/ Plenty of time winding out.\" Orth hits all the seasonal notes, from sugar plums to corduroys to fake snow to space heaters, but also manages to capture (at times, majestically) the glorious, scarfwrapping loneliness inherent to deep freeze. \"Velveteen (All Is Bright.)\" is painfully transformative and one of the band's strongest tracks to date: Michael Johnson's cymbal swats crack and whimper like icicles shattering, filled in by Tobi Echevarria's thick, loping bass (think snowshoes) and Jeff Hays' wispy, hotbreathoncoldair pedal steel. Orth coos earnestly about Santa Claus steering his reindeer straight to the bottom of Lake Superior (\"Without a thought he said 'Go Dasher, Go Dancer'/ And they dropped their heads, disappeared into the cloudbank...Those silver bells didn't make a sound when they fell to rest at the bottom of Superior\"), which seems like a precious conceit, until you stop thinking about it and just listen to his poem: slowly, the song tumbles towards a thundering climax, all heavy, honking synths, and guitar push, Orth bellowing fervently \"All is calm/ All is bright/ And they're dragging the lake with peppermint hooks, pink rushing to frostbite tips\" before slinking back into the band's signature closing hush.  Unsurprisingly, Quit +/or Fight is also a breakup record, heavy with heartache and dark, bellypunching bits. Orth always had a photographer's sense of detail and light, and here, watching becomes an essential thematic reprise. In \"Curious\", a lover is shakily peered at from a clearing, and in \"Losing Light\", Orth's eyes turn to a sleeping body: \"I watch you like some newborn kid/ Curling your fingers in and out of fists/ Run my thumb across your hip.\" Things aren't good (\"I'm lost to you\"), but Orth is veiled and careful with his details, immersing listeners in the fuzzy, shaking haze of endings.  Musically, the band stretches its muscle: \"3ShyClubs\" funnels mysterious percussive smacks into a grooveheavy bossa nova rhythm, while \"Curious\" folds in bass clarinet and sinewy falsetto. The title track originally appeared as a FOUND Magazine (publisher of found notes, letters, photographs, and stories) song of the month, and features a mess of snagged lyric crumbs, cobbled together into a shockingly logical whole (some of which seems like an eerily apropos PTSD response to military propaganda: \"OK, so I'm no longer/ The best of the best/ No longer defending the U.S.A.\") Still, the track, which mixes tinkling bells with steel guitar caws and high, layered harmonies, has moments of chilly clarity: \"You've done enough/ Quit and/or Fight,\" Orth implores. It's the perfect title for a band that demanded selfevolution, and got exactly what it wanted. "}
