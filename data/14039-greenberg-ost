Murphy laid out the family tree of LCD Soundsystem on his first single, thanks to \"Losing My Edge\"'s famous recordcollection pissing contest closing minutes. Absent from that laundry list is the first artist LCD ever covered, Harry Nilsson, whose \"Jump Into the Fire\" was an early live staple and eventual \"Daft Punk is Playing at My House\" Bside. Nilsson's weird 70s run of records approximate an accurate depiction of the L.A. experience, describing in his gentle, decaying falsetto the melancholy beneath the surface of sunny days and movie stars. So what better time for Murphy to indulge his inner Nilsson than when he's given the chance to go Hollywood, handling film score duties for Noah Baumbach's Greenberg. If previews are to be trusted, Greenberg itself finds Ben Stiller's main character down and out in L.A., so voila, the perfect storm for Murphy to finally make his own version of a sadsack record like Nilsson Schmilsson.Nowhere is that more apparent than \"Photographs\", the only song to appear in both vocal and instrumental form among 11 tracks credited here to Murphy. A woozy acoustic guitar and piano ballad, it's as far away from LCD Soundsystem as it is close to being a standardissue indie film soundtrack piece. It also unfortunately is a succinct portrait of the gulf between Murphy and Nilsson, as the former's voice bears more cracks than a dropped carton of eggs more the \"partied all night with John Lennon\" Nilsson of Pussy Cats than the vocal showstopper performance of \"Without You\". Murphy's singing has gotten a lot better since he basically monologued his way through the first LCD singles, but it's still better left disguised on the soloLennon howl of \"Oh You (Christmas Blues)\" (credited, strangely, to LCDSS) or the Ceciliaish folk jam of \"If You Need a Friend\".As far as the nonMurphy tracks, there's no Nilsson song to draw stark comparison. But a substitute measuring stick is provided by StrokeDad Albert Hammond, whose \"It Never Rains in Southern California\" is perfect L.A. pop depression and misanthropy wrapped in exquisite production. It's also exceedingly passive, which fits thematically with the Steve Miller Band's \"Jet Airliner\", Duran Duran's wonderful \"The Chauffeur\", and Galaxie 500's \"Strange\". Good songs all, but I'm thinking there are a lot of shots of a sad, unshaven Ben Stiller looking out the window and wondering where it all went wrong.With his score, Murphy doesn't do much to shake the main character out of that presumed selfpity. The instrumental numbers here are lowkey wallpaper (save the flamencostyle \"Gente\", which sounds more fit for Baumbach's buddy Wes Anderson), and many of the vocal tracks sound sparse and halfrealized. It is a peek at a singersongwriter side of Murphy that we haven't previously glimpsed, but searching for clues about the LCD Soundsystem LP due later this year is probably a futile effort Greenberg has side project written all over it. Love letter to Harry Nilsson or Greater Los Angeles, it's partly cloudy; as much as New York may be bringing Murphy down, it's a more appropriate muse. "}
