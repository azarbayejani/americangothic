Despite the fact that there's nothing inherently commercialized about their clubmusicskewing instrumental electronic rock, Ratatat seem to have been slotted into this very purpose over the course of their career, to the point where the same song of theirs \"Gettysburg\", from their 2006 album Classics has been used to score both a Nylon.com Marc Jacobs fashion show feature and a GOOD Magazine animated video on the nuclear arms race. Aside from what visual or informational stimulus someone else augments Ratatat's music with, there isn't really that much content there or, conversely, there's potential for the music to be and sound like anything but no one discernable identity.And yet this isn't to its detriment. Ratatat's music is only really as empty as you make it, and with LP3 like Classics and their eponymous debut, a title that looks deliberately unevocative of anything the duo of guitarist Mike Stroud and multiinstrumentalist Evan \"E*Vax\" Mast has created a soundtrack for just about whatever, modular music that turns its lack of contextual framing into a likeable sort of walkaround/drivearound/social gathering background music that doesn't exist to sell anything but your own current experience. It's a bit blank, but that only means it begs to be drawn on with fat markers, and any voiceless absence of humanity is made up for by the fact that runtime scripts don't get this arch just on their own. (The leadoff track's called \"Shiller\", ferchrissakes.) The core Ratatat formula remains largely intact deceptively basic but heavily layered pangenre hookloops that hover inside some kind of disco/rock/hiphop triangulation, supplemented by Stroud's bionic Brian May guitar work and Mast's enthusiasm for making synthesizers emit hyperactive spacefight sounds. And it's surprisingly endurable over fourminute doses, like the beatemup video game groove of \"Falcon Jab\" or the Loverboy rollerboogie of \"Shempi\", which pack in enough energy and dynamics to keep a good balance between catchiness and restlessness. It doesn't quite jump out as readily in the quieter or calmer moments: the semiacoustic, tabladriven \"Mi Viejo\" evokes sweeping scenes of Southwestern vistas in some sort of Sergio LeonegoesBollywood score scenario, and the downtempo \"Bruleé\" resembles the sort of melody the Bee Gees would've written in 1970 applied to shortcircuiting robopop, but their pleasures aren't quite as immediate. One of the other keys to LP3's simple appeal is its vague but noticeable internationalism, like the work of a couple of guys who were told by a director to \"skew kind of Timbaland\" and decided to take that superficial, derivative task into more farflung places. \"Mumtaz Khan\" lands between Middle and Far Eastern on the rhythmic backbone of a Miss E banger; \"Mirando\" layers pitchedup Thin Lizzy riffage over a rhythmic motif somewhere amidst Calcutta and Rio and Miles Davis' \"Black Satin\"; and tracks like \"Imperials\" and \"Bird Priest\" ride rhythms that have some tangential connection to a nonWestern musical structure or another, turning them insideout and blurring their origins to make them sound unstuck in geography. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book, and erasing the borders of international music into a sound that evokes little more than \"indistinctively foreign\" has its own pitfalls, but somewhere inside all that TV spot rock runs a pulse that beats like Top 40.Which is where the disappointment comes in: even the best beats on this album feel unfinished without vocals. There's nothing intrinsically flawed about what's otherwise a solid instrumental record, but so much of it feels so close to many of the things happening on the radio and the pop charts right now that, 90 seconds into a song, the mind might start wandering and wondering what this kind of stuff would sound like with Wale or Rihanna on top of it. Ratatat released a brief but solid twovolume run of selfreleased mixes that put this kind of music under the likes of Memphis Bleek and Missy Elliott and Kanye West, and it worked well, so maybe those releases and LP3 are warmups for a strange, new kind of career in R&B and hiphop production as some kind of weird nuNeptunes. For now, we'll just have to fill in the blanks. "}
