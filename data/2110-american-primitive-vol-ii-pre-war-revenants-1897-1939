The imagined correctives queue up: folk music's history is white racist, the Guthrie to Dylan to O Brother revival, Fahey and Takoma ripped their trad folk figure from toothless country mouths, freakfolk strives for an inauthentic or inaccurate primitivism. The telling question can be asked in the mirror: Who's the asshole, really? These wars have already been fought or fabricated: not listening, it turns out, is the only thing in line for a cure. One problem is scale; another's the otherwise brilliantly researched liner notes by Dean Blackwood and Edward Komara: words along the lines of \"the ineffable sought by every wannabe ramshackle outfit this side of a Williamsburg loft is here in spades,\" conjure melodrama, and strawmen as well shame on us all, right? But American Primitive Vol. II covers two discs, and its 50 songs are united only by the fact that these songs are so obscure even maniacal folk compilers like Harry Smith or Alan Lomax (one exception: 78 collector and Fonotone founder Joe Bussard) missed them the first time through. The relic quality comes through in the static crackles and transfer hiss that blanket songs cut into literal wax, stamped on shellac, neglected for years, and finally brought to CD: There is, ultimately, a lot of noise to cut through before the ghosts and the haunted end up in the same room. Released on John Fahey's Revenant label (his final work as a curator), it's easy to see how fully this was his project: Bayless Rose, an artist with only four vinyl sides to show for his existence, is as post as he is preFahey's ragged precision ramble. At the same time, the pathos that went subliminal in many of Fahey's later requia often finds an earlier vocalization in these tracks. Henry Spaulding, another guitar guy, puts it on \"Cairo Blues\" like this \"Women will treat you kind and sweet/ Kick and knife you, beat you and cut you, too.\" Though the mournful stuff punches guts (Mattie May Thomas' \"Workhouse Blues\" begins: \"A made up song, just about being in prison, alone\"), it's equally weird and complicated particularly in the figure of the Nugrape Twins. Of their two songs, one's a tired hymn (\"Let the Jesus gently guide me\"), the other a hymnal ad for \"Ice Cold Nugrape\", a pop jingle 80 years old. Don't get too certain yet; not with kazooled free hickjazz combo the Salty Dog Four playing spoiler.American Primitive breathes today though because of its New Year's resolution music, a bottomless and vengeful recounting of bloody mistakes and neveragains. Two deepreaching hollerers run this game: The unfathomably sad Elvie Thomas and the incredibly violent Geeshie Wiley. While Elvie's \"Motherless Child Blues\" obsesses on the past like \"My mother told me just before she died/ O daughter daughter please don't be like me/ To fall in love with every man you see,\" Geeshie's in the middle of making her mistakes: \"I'm gonna cut your throat baby, I'll look down in your face/ Gonna let some lonesome graveyard be your resting place.\" American Primitive's best songs are simply dangerous, in matters of faith (Homer Quincy Smith's \"I Want Jesus to Walk With Me\") and fucking around (Wiley and Thomas: \"Ashes to ashes, sand to sand/ Every married woman got a backdoor man\"); murder, too. Righting wrongs is just another kind of confession. "}
