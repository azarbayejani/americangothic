His desperate love letters Green Mind and Where You Been used Dinosaur Jr. as a pen, and though \"Thumb\" and \"Get Me\" surely had her crying off camera while filming Pulp Fiction, their starcrossed juniorhigh romance lingered only as a painful memory. Skaters bought into trashthrash like \"Whatever's Cool With Me\" and \"The Wagon\", never knowing the torment that drove J to hard drugs. Cure fans enticed by their cover of \"Just Like Heaven\" predictably latched on to the ballads, while \"Start Choppix92\" drew in Red Hot Chili Peppers converts wanting more Blood Sugar Sex Magick. That these people heard Dinosaur Jr. records is not J's fault: He only intended his music for Uma's ears. \"Green Mind\", the title track from his 1991 major label debut, crops up on Free So Free, its melody reprised for \"Everybody Lets Me Down\", which is telling: \"Green Mind\" was about Uma leaving Amherst. J had to reconcile her reasons as well as his choice to stay, and unsure, begged her for help: \"It's a call that's tough to make/ It could be a big mistake/ Can't you help move it along?\" Of his friends, he said, \"I can't handle them for long/ They're cool, but I need you/ On a certain level I think they're great/ But on another I can't relate/ To anything they do.\" A year later, emotionally devastated by the loss (which is all he can talk about in the Sonic Youth tour film 1991: The Year Punk Broke), J hit bottom during his despondent cover of Bowie's \"Quicksand\" on Whatever's Cool With Me, pining openly for his lost love. Where the original lyric bleats \"I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes,\" J adlibs \"I'm the twisted name on Uma's eyes.\" It's truly one of the most devastating moments in rock history, and it goes entirely unnoticed, buried in shrugs, stuffed animal album art and the unspoken prejudice that people who wore flannel didn't have real feelings. Once Uma hit it big, J was rudderless, running through chords he knew by heart; at the pit of his melancholy, he recorded \"Feel The Pain\", which repeats the mantra \"I feel the pain of everyone/ Then I feel nothing\" over and over. Kurt Cobain, a friend who'd asked J to drum for Nirvana before Dave Grohl came on board, had just committed suicide, and Uma's face was everywhere thanks to Pulp Fiction. Mascis was propped up by Kevin Shields, whose shoulder he cried on through the mid and late 90s; though Sonic Youth wrote their biggest hit \"Teenage Riot\" about J after Lee Renaldo played on \"Little Fury Things\", they were enjoying massive major label support for their grungeera material and had no time to help. On one hand I wonder how could they abandon their adoptive little brother, but that's the problem with depression: You never see the signs until it's too late. J lost a couple of years to drugs before releasing a pair of emotional and physical rehab records: The acoustic greatest hits set Martin + Me, and Hand It Over, which laid his conflict bare: \"There's so much I need to be/ And its gotta come from me/ Sure not over you.\" By the time he'd fully scrubbed up, left Uma behind and prepared to relaunch his career in earnest with 2000's More Light, most kids had no idea who Dinosaur Jr. were.More Light was over the top positivity from a recovering addict, putting the lies junkies tell themselves to music: \"Why does tomorrow feel/ Like a whole new love/ Like a whole new deal?\" It's difficult to listen to, and ultimately a frightening harbinger of relapse after the earnest steps forward J took on Hand It Over. Though Free So Free heralds further awakening in its title, it's a distended reclamation, an artist reverting to their glory days in hopes of atoning for latter day sins. Half the melodies in \"Set Us Free\" are taken from \"Out There\", but the song only drifts on that snowy landscape, never culminating in an avalanche to compare with its predecessor's chorus. \"Tell The Truth\" is the most unsettling piece of necrophilia on the record, a song you could sneak in anywhere on Green Mind if it weren't so sonically lifeless. Though \"Outside\" is a fine and tidier reprise of the lighthearted \"What Else Is New\" from Where You Been, the lyrics to Mascis' songs no longer resonate. He may not have realized how powerful his first person whining was in its simplicity, but now that he's using nostalgia for fuel, there's no sense of personal crisis or connection, no J behind the \"I\". While writing Free So Free, Mascis learned of Uma's impending return to glitz and glamour via Tarantino's Kill Bill. The raging \"Say The Word\" and two tender, defeated ballads \"If That's How It's Gotta Be\" and \"Someone Said\" are clearly the only songs put together after he heard the news. The former is a bitter, sarcastic indictment of her decision to pursue celebrity; the latter pair hark back to the twisted misery of Dinosaur Jr.'s earliest material, when J still held on to hope that Uma would come walking back through the door. When his muse is ascendent, J is at his best, and as an email excerpt that made the rounds on alt.binaries.umathurman late last year attests, there's hope yet for a stellar followup to Free So Free: \"Really J, it's for the best. We're two different people now, we can't give in to those easy old feelings. What we had was special...it was innocent, magical, and most of all, it wasn't real. We were bouncing back giddy passion and foolish conviction, things we only wished we understood. Don't think I'm turning my back on you, J, don't ever think that. I still daydream of us dancing beneath the high tension wires, hiding schnapps under our coats and checking each other's breath, but we just can't carry each other around anymore J, it's time we move on. Love, Uma\" "}
