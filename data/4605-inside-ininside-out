Max√Ømo Bloc Heads may set Pitchforkscribe hearts aflutter, but they're still as unlikely to play in Peoria as the late60s Kinks, let alone Morrissey or Pulp. The statesiders who'd most appreciate the emo underpinning Arctic Monkeys' precocious tales of bars and bouncers can't even drink legally. And Art Brut, they're still importonly. The Kooks take elements from their upandcoming peers and a name from Hunky Dory, achieving an adolescent universality that's at once their strongest pitch and greatest failing. The Brightonbased quartet fill their debut Inside In/Inside Out with almost enough exuberant choruses to make up for their more generic failings. Standout \"See the World\" and first single \"Eddie's Gun\" bristle with the straightforward dynamism of I Should Cocoera Supergrass. Followup \"Sofa Song\" mugs Strokes skuzz for an attempted hookup. Even as mellower tracks like \"Ooh La\" or \"Naive\" find an uncomfortable meeting point between the Verve and Eagle Eye Cherry, their singalong hooks are hard to hate. The acoustic pop of \"Jackie Big Tits\" is far more charming than its title suggests. \"You only go around, round, round,\" sings Luke Pritchard, his Casablancaschoked, thickly accented melodies translating thanks to sharp melodies and common themes. Ah, but common also has a pejorative sense. Fast and furious third single \"You Don't Love Me\" lacks its predecessors' catchiness, while the shimmying verses of \"Ooh La\" resort to faceless bromides: \"It's a hard life to live/ So live it well\". It's unclear why opener \"Seaside\" is acoustic and drumless, aside from youthful overconfidence; \"I'm just trying to love you,\" Pritchard complains. His oftrepeated thoughts on romance don't get much more novel on the band's sojourns into the umpteenthwave ska also practiced occasionally by the Arctics and fellow Brits the Paddingtons, such as the stuttering \"Match Box\" or awkwardly political \"If Only\". The Kooks' keen grasp of the banal isn't the only factor keeping them from a distinct personality. Between bouncy Britpop, angstridden acoustic anthems, redlight skanking, \"Hounds of Love\" ohoh harmonies, and the Delta blues intro to \"Time Awaits\", it's not clear the Kooks know who they want to be when they grow up yet, either. Weaker atmospheric tracks like \"I Want You Back\" and the closing \"Got No Love\" suggest the Kooks are best when they're focused instead on brash, catchy, preferably witty pop. True, the provincial focus of a band like Arctic Monkeys may make their songs difficult exports. By contrast, though, being universal doesn't have to mean being impersonal. "}
