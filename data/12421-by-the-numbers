{"label":" Unfiltered","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/12913/homepage_large.ce6f902a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"The Postmarks","title":"By-the-Numbers","text":" Last year's selftitled debut by sumptuous South Florida trio the Postmarks was full of songs that sounded like they might've been covers. Christopher Moll and Jonathan Wilkins, both previously of a Stereolableaning outfit called See Venus, crafted lavish, loungey arrangements that merged bossa nova, John Barry film scores, Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, and vintage French pop within direct, purepop songcraft enamored of romance and rainy days. Tel Avivborn singer Tim Yehezkely's shy whisper was a perfect final ingredient, evoking tweepoppers like the Softies or Camera Obscura as well as the seductive sophistipop of Unfiltered label chiefs Ivy.The Postmarks' second fulllength actually is a covers album and a fine one, at that. BytheNumbers follows the band's beguiling onlineonly recordings of Astrud Gilberto's swoonsome love song \"Dreamer\" and, more adventurously, Ministry's \"Everyday Is Halloween\". The project began as a monthly series of cover songs to be posted on eMusic, but by September the group had realized they had enough material for another proper album instead. There's one (yes, slightly precious) organizing principle: Each of the songs has a number in its title, counting up from 1 to 11, until the finale, the countingto12 \"Pinball Number Drop\" originally sung by the Pointer Sisters for \"Sesame Street\".Even if you didn't pay any attention to the song titles, BytheNumbers would still be a collection of goodtogreat songs performed in the swoonsome style the Postmarks made their signature on their first record. Yehezkely's understatement suits the lessismore theme of \"One Note Samba\"; based on Antoni Carlos Jobim's version, the cover is a natural fit for the Postmarks' already Braziliantinged sound. Yehezkely's softness also settles nicely into the whirling strings of the more stridently Nancy Sinatrasung Bond theme \"You Only Live Twice\" (familiar to those of us of a certain age and radiolistening habits as sampled in Robbie Williams' dire Y2K cashin \"Millennium\"). These slippers were made for walking to bed.When the Postmarks have to stretch more to make the songs their own, the results are no less satisfying. Bob Marley's \"Three Little Birds\" might have stood out like a fat white guy in a rastafarian hat, but instead it's a slowmotion highlight, with gentle guitars and widescreen percussion. Rockstyle drums and shimmery guitar lines do show up to grace the Postmarks' takes on Ride's \"OX4\" and the Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Nine Million Rainy Days\", but both manage to convey the nuance within the group's style rather than deviating too much from it if Air could soundtrack a Sofia Coppola film, why not these cats? Blondie's \"11:59\" is a bit of a reach, but getting more upbeat doesn't hurt the Postmarks here. An Ennio Morriconeflavored remake of the Byrds' \"Eight Miles High\" is the only track that doesn't quite cohere, although David Bowie's regal croon is missed on \"Five Years\".One revelation is the Ramones \"711\", which ends up sounding less like a deadpan punkpop reference to girlgroup classics than a sincere and allnew teenage symphony. \"Whatever happened to the radio?/ And where did all the fun songs go?\" Yehezkely murmurs, per Joey R., embodying the song's tragic \"Leader of the Pack\"/\"Last Kiss\"esque conclusion as if there had never been a \"Leader of the Pack\" or \"Last Kiss\". BytheNumbers probably wouldn't have ever been played much on the radio in the past couple of decades, and its mood is more relaxing than fun, but it's a lovely set of covers that sound like they could've been originals. Hey, somebody give the Postmarks another number. "}
