Read the following questions and select the best answer from the options listed below. 01.\tGiven the following description of a track from Bardo Pond's recent ATP release On the Ellipse, indicate the song title and emotional hue in which the work metaphorically bathes you. \"Beginning with a melody laid out sparingly by a somber acoustic guitar so intimately close you can hear nimble fingers sliding on the greased frets the song builds on its base with calculated, yet never forced harmonies, in part courtesy of the ethereal and omnipresent wind. After an appropriately soothing lull, the droning crash manifests as the rhythm section propels itself into the spotlight, lasting until the song's lumbering end. (a)\t\"Killing All The Flies\", no...Happy Songs For Happy People + Green. (b)\t\"Every Man\" + Black. (c)\tThat song with the paperthin allegory + Grey. (d)\tAll of the above. (e)\tNone of the above. 02.\tYou're at a concert. A hot Earth Motherlooking woman is playing Sabbath riffs on a flute set against a wavering guitar line. Drum and bass work together to draw out overarching stomps of pure noise and energy that eventually form a blistering, dense wall. What is the name of the band you are watching, what song are they playing, and what is the concordant sexual position to accompany intimate listening to said song? (a)\tFleetwood Mac + \"Say You Love Me\" + The Butterfly (b)\tBardo Pond + \"Dom's Lament\" + Missionary (c)\tSlint + (the song the group would have made had they contracted a female bandmember as advertised in the liner notes of Spiderland) + Gemini (d)\tI don't know. Personally, I only take note of clarinet players, what with their tighter embouchure and greater tongue control. (e)\tNone of the above.MATCHING. Match the following artist with their band role. 1. Isobelle Sollenberger 2. Michael Gibbons 3. Clint Takeda 4. John Gibbons 5. Joe Culver (a) Guitar 1 (b) Guitar 2 (c) Vocalist/Flautist (d) Drummer (e) BassistPASSAGE INTERPRETATION. Answer the following questions based upon analysis of the given excerpt. \"...similar to Janis Joplin fronting Acid Mothers Temple buried underneath a fog of dense instrumentation. A tumultuous guitar chimes in to wonderful effect, as Isobelle's voice fluctuates from meek humility to forceful gusto, building toward a plump bass line that slides \"Test\" into silent acquiescence. \"JD\" and \"Walking Clouds\" both make use of the dry ambience of their recording atmosphere, the former eventually laying on thick electric reverb in lieu of its introductory acoustic sound, the latter content to muddle on the sixstring like a less complex John Fahey. To this mixture \"Clouds\" also adds a faint human sighing/humming, acting as the constant, lesser companion to a flourishing flute melody, a tune that constantly has to fight for fresh air over the entire second half of the track. The heavy hitter comes last: \"Night Of Frogs\" ends the album on a deservedly high note. After a guitar and effectsladen false intro, the song eventually begins with the light plucking and strumming of an acoustic guitar, laying the foundation for a melody that will eventually be eaten alive by song's end. Atop a full load of odd percussion, Isobelle expounds on the uneasy topic of mortality and the speed with which one's time passes on Earth, slowly leading the listener into the belly of the beast as bongos usher in the inevitable and desirable crash and crescendo of the fully orchestrated band. The frontal assault is slowly deflated until the song's relatively peaceful end, leaving one nearly as grateful for the conclusion as the experience itself. 01.\tWhat is the reviewer's general attitude of the work in question? (a)\tOverall distaste with strong leanings toward hatred. (b)\tAmbivalence why should such a small wrinkle in the fabric of music cause a stir one way or the other? (c)\tStrong regard for the composition album of the year material. (d)\tLukewarm acceptance of an on par work, produced by a decidedly enjoyable band. 02.\tBased upon the above critique, would you: (a)\tAgree with the reviewer. Though the fusion of jam band mentality does fortuitously jell with the ebb and flow of postrock instrumental techniques, at times this mixture can highlight the more undesirable characteristics of both musical genres. (b)\tDisagree with the reviewer. This is stonerrock at its epitome; the reviewer needs to toke up or get out. (c)\tStrongly disagree with the reviewer. Expect a flurry of emails attempting to ridicule the haphazard opining of said miscreant. (d)\tNeither agree or disagree. "}
