I was weaned on pop radio, and anything less than \"the best\" sounded like chickenscratch. It took me a few years, but eventually I came to appreciate the immediacy of more raw recordings. Now I have a distaste for music that sounds too glossy. It works in intricate electronic music and R&B;, but when I hear a rock band with that overproduced sheen it leaves a bad taste in my mouth it's hard for me to avoid the sense that there's a certain lifestyle being sold along with the music. I'm just glad my tastes turned tail, because five years ago, I might have been all over this stuff. The Zincs isn't so much a band as it is the work of one man, Jim Elkington (aka Jim Zinc). He's from London, but like so many mystifying Brits, his accent virtually disappears when he sings. Elkington's voice sounds rich and worn with age a weathered old bastard like Paul Weller or Mark Lanegan but his music is a twangy breed of rockandroll that seems sure to have come out of the rural American Midwest. Yet, the Ohio Gold label is actually based in Chicago, Elkington's current home. The Zincs might get accused of being altcountry, but the little details Elkington spreads throughout his songs keep the album from being pigeonholed as part of the No Depression scene. \"I Remember\" begins with strange, whining electronics and Elkington's vibrant fingerpicking. Halfway through, the song shifts suddenly into searing guitar distortion, then back to the melody before this short, slow little introduction ends. \"Two Patients\" picks up with a bender of a groove, punchdrunk guitars swerving back and forth across the lines set down by the bass and drums. \"I had forgotten what it means to be scared,\" Elkington sings, but he sounds far from cowed. \"Never Endeavour\" reveals a more vulnerable side. Jim breathes reassurances (\"we'll weather together away from the cold\"), and the soft guitars and drums fade into an organ solo that restates the main melody really sweetly. On \"Opening Time,\" the deliberate snaretick and acoustic strum paint a lazy picture that doesn't need to be elaborated upon beyond the song title; Elkington asks, \"Close your eyes, were they closed all the time?\" and the mellow slide guitar admits as much. It's a drinking song, and there seem to be a few of them on Moth and Marriage, but while each is worldweary they're also heartwarming. \"Whisper in the Well\" is built around a dismal chorus (\"There's a whisper in the well tonight/ Soak this parasite\"), but the meandering guitar jangle, tambourine and repetitious hook make it dirge so good. \"X in Executor\" cranks the volume as Elkington yowls distortedly into the mic and layers of guitars weave together in pure WoweeZoweeera Pavement chaos. With the album closer, \"In the Hallway,\" Elkington returns to the experimental vibe, stroking the nylon strings of his guitar into a complex melody that slows to a crawl and ends in forlorn harmonica notes. While he pockmarks his songs with odd electronic touches and drones here and there, Elkington's first and foremost concerned with songwriting. And he never takes himself too seriously there's a current of dry humor running through the record, as on the bossanovatinged \"The Elemental\" where he takes a dive towards selfmockery: \"Show me the list of affectations/ I can do all of them without a stop.\" I guess the Zincs' name came from the galvanizing property of the ore: I listen to this on the way to work in the morning, and it gives me a boost.
