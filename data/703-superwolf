{"label":" Drag City","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/698/homepage_large.520c0dd2.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amanda Petrusich","artist":"Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy and Matt Sweeney","title":"Superwolf","text":" In \"My Home Is the Sea\", Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy, voice thin and impossibly brittle, conveys proud love for his bulbous tummy, gleefully declaring it \"round and firm and funny\" just like him! Sardonic or not, this kind of bellyspeak marks a rare moment of selfrevelation for Will Oldham, who skewers accepted notions of static identity nearly every time he lowers his big, bearded jaw. Still, Oldham (appearing here as contemporary alterego Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy) is, ultimately, exactly what he says he is smart and tough and weird, an awkward, oddly charismatic songwriter just as wellsuited to coughing up deathballads as he is to giggling out ditties about his penis. Witness, again, the bitter joy of loyal Oldhamhood: He is simultaneously quiet and loud, both crushing and absurd, and filed in seven different places at the record store.Superwolf, a new collaboration with guitar freelancer Matt Sweeney, sees Oldham at his squirrely best, squeaking out his finest songs since 1999's I See a Darkness. Superwolf marks Oldham's first official partnership with Sweeney, whose credits include a predictably brief stint axegrinding in Billy Corgan's Zwan (alongside longtime Oldham buddy and Slintforefather Dave Pajo), occasionally playing guitar in Guided by Voices, and fronting the longdeparted Chavez (who released two revered fulllengths on Matador in the mid90s).Sweeney's participation in Superwolf was supposedly a response to a songwriting \"challenge\" from Oldham, and in addition to songwriting, Sweeney contributes backing vocals and guitar figures that echo Oldham's own blows, sometimes with eerie accuracy. But despite all that buddying up, Superwolf is still at times unnervingly spare Oldham and Sweeney's pauses can be devastating, and some of Superwolf's most powerfully convincing bits pop up between notes.Opener \"My Home Is the Sea\" may sound an awful lot like late Grateful Dead (or, perhaps more specifically, like a slightly less raucous version of brother Ned Oldham's Anomoanon, who regularly employ Garciabrand noodling and wild, spacerock somersaults), but most of Superwolf is quiet and intensely meditative, despite Sweeney's significant rockinflections. Still, Oldham has always had a funny habit of inserting perverse, quasisexual shouts into otherwisestaid songs (see brutally confessional couplets rubbing up against phrases like \"my horny horn\"), and at least thematically, Superwolf's eleven tracks are predictably shifty \"My Home Is the Sea\" is rife with snarky lyric tricks (watch Oldham follow the momentarily devastating \"I have often said/ That I would like to be dead\" with a tiny pause and silent giggle, finally finishing with: \"In a shark's mouth\").No matter who or what he calls himself, Will Oldham has always been uniquely capable of making colossal leaps in tone between breaths, and from track to track Superwolf nobly maintains that practice, drifting gracefully from classicrock stomps to whispery dirges. Consequently, Oldham followers may recognize Superwolf as a welcome midway point between Oldham's past aliases, as it hops from shambling, Viva Last Bluesish, Palace Musicera shakes to dark, Master and Everyone haunts. \"Beast for Thee\" matches a gorgeous, barelythere melody with selfdeflating lyrics (\"Why are you kind to me?/ You could so easily take me in your arms and see/ A donkey\"), Oldham's quivering pipes and Sweeney's fragile guitar coalescing into a soft, droning, and tremendously pretty whole. The equally excellent \"Blood Embrace\" features some of Oldham's heartiest vocals, each word strong and full, floating above dark electric guitar swirls, dodging film samples of a faithless woman whispering to an unnamed lover, crafting an atmosphere so tense and ominous that you almost can't help twisting your face around to peep over your shoulder.Soft and subtle, Superwolf is the kind of record that unwinds slowly, and is best enjoyed over multiple listens and, unsurprisingly, many glasses of wine. Oldham and Sweeney mew coquettishly, stroking their guitars, cawing bizarre stories about love, death, and body parts: theirs is a rancid and beautiful landscape.Â  "}
