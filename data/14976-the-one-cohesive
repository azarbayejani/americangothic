COHESIVE","text":" Last year, Huntsville, Ala., hiphop duo GSide took message board buzz and rap blog kudos for 2008's Starshipz and Rocketz and turned it into a minimovement with the ambitious, worldly, blogobsessed Huntsville International. The biggest musical export from Huntsville last year, however, was Antoine Dodson and the Gregory Brothers' \"The Bed Intruder Song\", an embarrassing local news clip turned Internet meme that inexplicably hit the Billboard Hot 100. On The ONE... COHESIVE, GSide rapper ST 2 Lettaz, the braying, bold contrast to partner Yung Clova's raspy skepticism, makes two purposefully crude references to Antoine Dodson. \"Never\" features a dismissive aside (\"tampons for you Antoines\") and on \"Came Up\", he warns rappers, \"like the Lincoln Park rapist, I'm comin' through your window.\" ST's ire stems from Dodson's complicity in presenting Huntsville as another backwoods hood (GSide calls it \"a mini Memphis\" for good reason). But Dodson's use of the web to make a better life for himself and his family is probably something GSide can get behind. These guys rap excitedly about blog love with the same joy they do when they talk about, say, not working at the gas station anymore, or the \"couple thou\" they get for shows these days. This isn't because they're selfsatisfied knuckleheads who don't see the bigger picture, but because, as far as they're concerned, right now their doggedly D.I.Y. comeup is all that matters. Tellingly, a highlight from COHESIVE is titled \"Inner Circle\". And then there are the beats. On Starshipz & Rocketz and Huntsville International, the production from inhouse beatmakers the Block Beattaz mixed Southern thump and raverap experimentalism. Those records sounded like a logical but bold extension of the Dungeon Family aesthetic of the late 1990s. For COHESIVE, the Block Beattaz and likeminded producers ATeam, Str8 Drop, Clams Casino, the Basmo Family, and DJ Burn One create expansive, nextlevel compositions as audacious as GSide's raps are modest. It's a strange combination big, lush beats and stories about small victories but it turns songs that are celebratory of simple things (a girl sending sexy cellphone pictures, visiting Paris for the first time) or full of thoughtful sentiments (supporting family, helping community) into something epic. Each grandiose beat is stuffed full of pained, joyful catharsis like the music scoring one of those big \"Aha!\" moments in a heady scifi flick. Seriously, some creative kids with extra time on their hands should set homemade montages to this album and stick them up on YouTube: the Coldplay pianos and spacey drum'n'bass of \"Y U Mad\" to Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain, maybe, or \"Inner Circle\"'s stormy bursts of synths and strings to Inception. And there's a steady buildup to these beautiful beats, with every song playing a crucial part in soundtracking ST and Clova's scrappy triumphs: \"Nat Geo\" propels the album forward, ever so slightly, and \"Never\" shoots the album into hyperspace, redirecting its energies for a thoughtful finale. Despite precious references to the Internet and more than enough minimythmaking, GSide remain painfully aware of the blog hype echo chamber. On \"Y U Mad\", ST asks, \"if everyone's a star, then who gonna be the audience?\" and Clova grounds the track with an affecting endrun around competition: \"Niggas jealous? I'm just trying to feed my fam.\" \"MoneyInTheSkyII\", a sequel to a song GSide released for free last spring (and put together while on tour in Norway), finds the group questioning whether they should continue the independent route, get a regular job, or just return to hustling. Even on their most accomplished, comfortable album, GSide don't forget this rap shit is complicated. "}
