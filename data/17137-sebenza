{"label":" Hyperdub","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/18325/homepage_large.fe977ec4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ruth Saxelby","artist":"LV","title":"Sebenza","text":" The South London trio LV's followup to last year's accomplished Routes, and their first fulllength on Hyperdub, is a trip in every sense. Sonically, Sebenza is strung somewhere between UK funky and South Africa's kwaito, two invigoratingly elastic dance music worlds that draw on a rich and overlapping heritage. Vocally it features turns from three distinctive South African acts, Johannesburg's rapper/producer Spoek Mathambo and Okmalumkoolkat of music/performance art crew Dirty Paraffin along with Cape Town kwaito duo Ruffest. Each taps into, bounces off of, and elevates different elements in LV's music. And lyrically it's laced with a potent mix of languages: Zulu, Xhosa, English, and each MC's idiosyncratic slang. Those junctures and juxtapositions tease a thrillingly new energy into being, one that breeds a deeper infatuation with every lean closer. LV's journey towards Sebenza, which means \"work\" in Zulu, began with a trip that Gerv Gordon took to South Africa at the end of 2009 to visit family (he was born in Cape Town but moved to London as a child). There, invigorated by the music scenes he encountered, he was introduced to Okmalumkoolkat through Spoek Mathambo, which resulted in 2010's tightly wound firecracker \"Boomslang\",  setting the precedent for subsequent collaborations with Spoek and Ruffest. Hailing from the township of Nyanga close to Cape Town, Kwaito duo Ruffest rap in a mix of Xhosa and English. Mirroring the duo's bulletlike, onthebeat, almost grime delivery, LV's production for Ruffest's features is taut and punchy. While \"Nothing Like Us\" and \"ThaTha Lo\" have that chinjutting dancefloor bounce, \"Hustla\" strikes a chord with the global club underground's current spooky/sexy strain. Gorgeous album closer \"Uthando Lwaka\", which means something between your love and love salvation in Xhosa, pits Ruffest's roughness against garage skips and squeals to surprisingly heartleaping effect. With Spoek Mathambo, who this year released his second experimental hiphop album, Father Creeper, on Sub Pop, LV had license to get abstract, resulting in the two most quietly reflective moments on the record. \"Limb\" and \"Work\" both fizz with funk's lowslung sensual energy, albeit at a fraction of the pace, with the latter's skittering finger clicks providing perfect kindling to Spoek's skeletal lyrics. While his presence is minimal, Spoek's features act as crucial pivot points and breathing spaces on Sebenza's otherwise nonstop ride. It's Okmalumkoolkat who's the undisputed star of the show, however, and not only because he features on eight of the album's 14 tracks. He has something of a Keith Haring pep to his postit note flow, spitting sharply and wittily on the universal intricacies of digital life. \"Dude, we need many more hits/ Yeah, I know,\" he playfully backchats himself on \"Animal Prints\". Perhaps because they've worked together before, LV are at their most ampedup and angular on the tracks featuring Okmalumkoolkat, providing the acrobatic MC with plenty of audio hinges to spring off and distilling his frenetic energy with skillful framing.  On title track \"Sebenza\", an ode to putting your back into it, his rolling \"r\"s ricochet off LV's synths, working their tension into something urgent and infectious. Then on \"International Pantsula\", he channels Joyce Sims' late80s hit \"Come Into My Life\" on the hook, vocoder warping the line to \"you gotta check out my blog, I got so much shit to show you,\" as if to underline that the spirit of our times is more often about likes not love. It's not all jokes though: again on \"Sebenza\" he slips in, \"Since a way back they've been trying to silence us.../ Rubber bullets.\" Those final two words wobble menacingly atop a precipice of bass, a disillusioned allusion to the South African police service's infamous and inflammatory employment of them at many social protests of the past few years.  An understanding that runs deeper than accessible language is the challenge and reward that Sebenza offers. Do we need to know what an artist is saying to hear what they're saying? Do we need a translation to respond to the energy? In the 21st century these questions should be as rhetorical as they feel. \"I'm a Zulu confuser/ Zulu computer/ Zulu wha' wha' what?\" teases Okmalumkoolkat on the ultra earwormy \"Zula Compurar\". Then on the divinely disheveled \"Spitting Cobra\" he pleads, \"My slang is my language/ Please understand it/ Please understand it.\" With Sebenza, LV meet Okmalumkoolkat, Ruffest, and Spoek Mathambo on common ground somewhere between South London and South Africa. What they've so deftly achieved is providing the space for each MC to carve out their own story: They neither swamp nor leave them adrift. The tracks feel like true collaborations rather than features. The energy exchange feels mutual. Sebenza feels like the future, now. "}
