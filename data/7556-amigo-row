Read on! AMOUNT MERGE APPARENTLY SPENT ON THE PACKAGING: Thirtyfive cents. POP ICON WHOM SUGGS MOST RESEMBLES: Matt is, fascinatingly, the lycanthropine doppelganger of the big brother from The Goonies. ARTIST THIS ALBUM MOST TRUMPS: Frank Black not to be confused with Black Francis or Charles Thompson. Amigo Row is the maturebutnotboring, laidwayback singer/songwriter album that Black's been struggling to halfmake for years. Suggs' embodiment of the Pixiecumpooper is uncanny, down to the lisp, spaciness, and the nervous, breathy falsetto. Intimations of Black Francis' girlnamedropping Bossanova do bubble up, though, as Suggs croons him some Clementines, Janies, and Hannahs. ARTIST MOST HAUNTING THIS ALBUM: Stephen Malkmus. Suggs' old band Butterglory (who themselves most haunt the hyper tease \"Calm Down\") couldn't escape Pavement Junior labels, despite their growth from a collegeradiorockbynumbers lofi concern into the guiteurs of Are You Building a Temple in Heaven? and the standoffish New Zealandry of RatTatTat. The Wedding Present even covered both bands (Pavement's \"Box Elder\" and Butterglory's \"Waiting on the Guns\"). Suggs' two solo discs have weirdly paralleled the permanentafternoon trippop of Malkmus' two selfhelmed excursions. This album's \"Jonathan Montgomery\" chugs along on a mean, Frostythick, mid70s riff similar in sasstiness to SM's \"Black Book\", even if Suggs' track pauses for pianobar buildups. EXTRATEXTUAL REASONS TO SAMPLE THIS DISC'S MELLOW GOLD: Contrary to Digital Underground's hardsell, no one ever invented sex packets. The department store Dillard's features a \"punk\" clothing section. People are using \"oxycontin\" as a verb, like \"rollin\" or \"ballin.\" Plastic surgeons are working to get small breasts considered a medical condition (\"micromastia\"). FILM THIS ALBUM MOST EVOKES: Jesus' Son. Some stumbly, tragicomic, Arizonian quality in this record fits Alison Maclean's debut adaptation of Denis Johnson's overbeloved drug stories. If Maclean was male, she would have been heralded as a gawkplex messiah. BUT YOU KNOW: All these bordertown lyrics about \"Tehachapi girls\" have got me thinking Suggs favors an anoxeric Benicio del Torso. WORST SONG: \"New Year\". They's even a reference to that song that rhymes with \"Mold Fang Whine\". They's even a reference to resolutions. This pianode is unfortunately the closest Suggs comes to sentimentality, though his speaker is still all intoxicated and trapped and alienated. I just don't get these Gregoriansignificance poses. An indie Elton Joel, anyone? Mom? Mulchpile? ALTERNATE TITLES THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED: Albuquerque Nosebleeds. Painting Ranchy Patterns in the Cojones Hotel Lobby. ACTUAL NEUHIPPIE NAME OF BACKING BAND: Thee Higher Burning Fire. Consider an Anomoanon being drygulched by The Band in a world where The Band formed after The Velvet Underground had busted up. MOST MYSTERIOUS SONG: \"Father\". Yes! Where could a fella order a whole set of tracks like this one, which cops a Tapstone and might be about some kind of assassination? The speaker is being tracked down by horsemen, and his father is as impotent as the dad in J.M.Coetzee's Disgrace. The lack of explanation adds so much to the song's passionate creeps. Thee Higher Burning Fire plinks and plods with such coherent grace that I must scream to you the virtues of how excellently Brian \"Sure, I'll Produce It\" Paulson captured the crispness of the four November days when this record became data. BEST OPENING LINES: This honor goes to \"Darling Hannah\", which begins, \"You were rapping on and on about some hocus pocus virtue/ That carried you away to the downtown fuck scene.\" Wow. I told you this thing was Malkmushaunted. The song accretes to constitute an excellent wedge of Suggs' strident saloonism, eventually abandoning the predictable plane of breakup songs and vaulting itself into the slutmosphere, or maybe the regretmosphere.
