Find the deepest well you can and climb on in and wait it out.\" Her retreatandwait mode of problem solving seems most appropriate for a child how many adults have Aesop on their bookshelves, after all and it appropriately draws to a gentle close a record that, not unlike a superhip preschool teacher, turns pop songs into proverbs. Enthusiasm is not, ironically enough, something that Immaculate Machine approaches lightly. Fables has energy and vitality to spare, but any emotional release is consistently tempered by intimations for better living.Â  \"Jarhand\", the record's most effusive track, opens the LP with a ramp toward a pubchant coda (sung by Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos and his new discovery the Cribs, who were recording at the same studio) that echoes Calder's occasional dalliances with the New Pornographers. Like so many A.C. Newman songs, \"Jarhand\" also packs crypticallyworded, foreboding lyrics (\"always want what you don't understand,\" then \"your time is coming up\") into a buoyant, shapeshifting melody. Second track \"Dear Confessor\" continues the group's fiercely advisory powerpop spirit, warning those searching for treasure to trust their instincts, keeping in mind that \"maps won't show us where we're going.\" \"C'mon Sea Legs\" effectively reverses Calder's suggestions from \"Light\", urging the most delicate form of action: \"come on now, put a sweater on and go outside for a while.\" The song opens with guitarist Brooke Gallupe alone on vocals, exposing his strained croon, which he augments with bits of dramatic affect substituting for range. Calder joins Gallupe for the second half, and the song expands into a constructionpaper wave of gentle encouragement. Calder's voice is as spindly and emphatic as Gallupe's is deliberate and smug, yet both come across with a youthful fervor that outpaces either's ability. The duo's harmonies thus become one of Fables' most memorable components, coming to full fruition on the foreboding \"Old Flame\", which more or less sounds like Archie and Veronica trying on the icy passion of John Doe and Exene Cervenka. It's a fine pallette from which to work, leading the song to its wellearned fiery conclusion.  The band wears didacticism well, but the album's catechizing can feel a become a bit cumbersome and murky at times. This makes the Machine's enlisting of arrangerforhire Owen Pallett seem like a perfect idea, and, as advertised, he leaves his clearly recognizable mark on two of Fables's best songs. Pallett's strings creep in for the middleeight of \"Roman Statues\" like the French horn in the Beatles' \"For No One\", and smear the sinuous \"Small Talk\" throughout with an airy, august drama. Fables seems designed to be heard as an anthology of songs one that loosely uses the ideals, if not necessarily the style, of its literary predecessor and as such, doesn't present a uniform message, but a collection of disparate ones. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Fables is least effective when its lessons are aimed inward instead of toward whomever might be within earshot. There's nothing particularly wrong with a song like \"Nothing Ever Happens\", which sees the band go fullon into poppunk ennui, but it feels out of place surrounded by its more lyrically adventurous counterparts. Gallupe's voice temporarily channels Will Sheff on \"Pocket\", and his strident amorousness (\"I'm out looking for sex but all I get is love\") does nothing as a penultimate song but starkly contrast with Calder's skittish closer. When Fables succeeds, and it does more often than not, its songs tackle the tenuous stage of young life when quests for knowledge are pushed aside by harsh realities, offering wellintentioned advice to navigate these moments. It's a pious sentiment indeed, perhaps best summed up with a lyric from \"Small Talk\": \"The big ideas somehow snuck in when we weren't looking, and scared away the lighthearted laughter of our innocence.\" "}
