{"label":" Whatever We Want","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/10414/homepage_large.72f968ae.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Mark Pytlik","artist":"Map of Africa","title":"Map of Africa","text":"  While it's been disproportionately hyped by folks in and around the dance music community, Thomas Bullock (Rub 'N Tug, A.R.E. Weapons) and DJ Harvey's Map of Africa really doesn't have much in common sonically with dance music at all. Variously described as \"protodisco\" (mildly defensible) and \"beardo house\" (more wrong than right), this fulllength debut is still miles away from those. So before anything else, try to forget what it says on the \"file under\" tab; if this qualifies as disco or house, its only under their most tangential and gracious definitions, i.e. those of the much less splintered 1970s, when stoner riffs and 4/4s routinely rubbed up against each other on DJ playlists. What does that leave us with? Basically, a classic rock record. More than anything else, Map of Africa is evidence for rock's increasing movement back towards 70sinflected psychedelia. But where bands like Sweden's Studio have furnished that overall sound with spacier, more modern sonics, MoA prefer to keep it close to the bone. With the exception of a few of the more straightforward bluesrock tracks, which pop in a way that only rock recorded on digital can, the production here remains studiously faithful to the source material that inspired it. In that sense, this slots in comfortably with contemporaries like Arbouretum and A Mountain of One, in that all of them feel like they're on personal missions to engineer the 70s rock record they couldn't find secondhand. Of the 14 tracks here, it's the simple, skanky, meat'n'potatoes material that has the largest potential to polarize and rankle. From the inferior cover of the Equals' \"Black Skin Blue Eyed Boy\" to the sleazy, barroom rock of \"Gonna Ride\", Map of Africa are at their most facile when they attempt as they do for roughly half the record to locate themselves somewhere near, say, Thin Lizzy or Mot√∂rhead. Combined with Bullock's puffedout vocal delivery and his purposefully ludicrous lyrics (\"Once or maybe twice a day/ Dirty lovin baby it's okay/ I like it straight around the bend/ Enough for me and both my friends\" goes \"Dirty Lovin\"), it's often hard to see beyond this as a slightly selfindulgent genre exercise. It's not all so hardcharging, though. With its gurgling analog synths, churning rhythms, and slow, spacey builds, \"Ely Cathedral\" begs comparisons to vintageperiod Can. Elsewhere, the short drone piece \"Creation Myth\", the ragged psychedelia of \"Plastic Surgery\", and the woozy, almostpretty title track prove that it's the more psychedelic, krautinspired moments in which Map of Africa shine. In the end, though, what you get out of this debut will depend mostly on your appetite for tongueincheek, guitarinhand and cockstuffedproudlyunderleather. One man's mustachio sweat is another man's treasure your mileage may vary. "}
