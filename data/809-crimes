{"label":" V2","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/803/homepage_large.62a8c402.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Rob Harvilla","artist":"The Blood Brothers","title":"Crimes","text":" These voices cannot be human. In full mushroomcloud bloom, Blood Brothers Johnny Whitney and Jordan Blilie scream as if they're drowning, their scalpelthin shrieks clinging to each other as they flail. The effect is not just vicious and visceral but downright brutal. All you can do is cringe. The catchiest tune on Crimes the quintet's fourth fulllength and first for V2 sounds like a Boss Hog track. It's called \"Love Rhymes With Hideous Car Wreck\", and it features a scuzzpunk riff and Whitney bleating, \"Love love love, love love love, love love love, love love love,\" as if he were the prancing flower girl at Bj√∂rk's wedding. Blilie snarls baritone macho counterpoint like Jon Spencer, except he's full of murderous disdain instead of himself. Eventually, he's overpowered by a 30second throatshredding breakdown. Yes, the Brothers still overuse lyrical gore the way the Evil Dead series did Kero syrup, but their sonic pace and intensity has somewhat slowed. This, the band insists, is borne out of necessity. Plowing through three straight fiveminute shriekingfit epics from last year's breakthrough Burn, Piano Island, Burn proved exhausting and nearimpossible onstage, so Crimes paces itself with entrailsspilling murder ballads and packs its breakneck hardcore freakouts into twominute dirty bombs. Thus, you now get both the decaying equine jam \"Beautiful Horses\" (\"Ride the crippled horse! Ride the broken mare! Ride the jaundiced buck!\"), as well as the fabulous pop/punkflaying \"Teen Heat\", which coins the excellent phrase \"promageddon.\" However, any fears that the songs' slashed runtimes are a pop makeover for their new label are unwarranted: The Brothers remain as violent and creatively unpleasant as ever, with enough clout to thank Brett Gurewitz in the liner notes but enough subversion to misspell his name. In the \"How the Hell Could This Possibly Be a College Radio Hit?\" category, \"Trash Flavored Trash\" isn't quite as joyously horrifying as Piano Island's \"Ambulance vs. Ambulance\", but it still highlights what these Seattle miscreants do best: coat Daliworthy horror flick imagery (\"There's a girl in a cage making love to a switchblade/ There's a man behind bars milking abandoned cars/ There's a priest in shackles building bombs out of bibles\") in candycoated riffs that roil and mutate and abruptly erupt.Crimes' quieter moments are neither as predictable nor consistent. The title track/mission statement (\"We're just like those condom wrappers/ Used up, torn up, thrown away\") showcases Whitney's astonishing vocal range, which veers from tortured James Brown screams to spoton simulations of new labelmate Jack White's babytalk tirades and Gossip diva Beth Ditto's whitepunksonAretha testifying. On \"Live at the Apocalypse Cabaret\" he's somewhat muzzled, hauling in Blilie's spokenword sneers for balance but saddling the duet with a decaying Ben Folds piano barbounce weighed down by a macabre image ammo dump: masturbating priests, lions eating your children on television, \"Baby heads planted in the ground don't make baby trees.\" The tune's moody pianoandguitar outro is gloriously mauled by \"Beautiful Horses\", and although the record's finale, \"Devastator\", begins with fervent gospel moans, they're eventually torn asunder by an atom bombtossing brawl showcasing perhaps the Brothers' ultimate thesis: \"Everybody needs a little devastation.\" Just because The Blood Brothers figured out how to prevent exhausting themselves doesn't mean they can't exhaust you.
