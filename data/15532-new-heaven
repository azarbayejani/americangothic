Ten minutes in, \"Heat Lightnin'\" and its combination of flickered acoustic guitars, overeager stereo panning effects, and Nic Snyder's campfirelit whispers conjure a hifi version of Animal Collective's embryonic Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished. Immediately afterward, there's a Raekwon namedrop over a digital dancehall beat on \"Lonesome Boring Summer\". And that's all before a trueblue C&W waltz wherein the narrator steals a soldier's sweetheart and tries to offer some sort of cold comfort by getting the poor chump to see it from his perspective. What the hell? Despite the above description, New Heaven isn't a Weenstyle mock survey of the past decade's indie rock trends; 1,2,3 are too goodnatured and enthusiastic for that sort of thing. Rather than dutifully checking off a todo list, 1,2,3 select their sounds Ã  la carte, and the strongest songs within the farflung coordinates of New Heaven simply scan as ofthemoment. They're wise to lead off with \"Work\", where Snyder's flamboyant falsetto gives spangly frill to the sort of fistsup, surging arrangements that Arcade Fire and Broken Social Scene made their stockintrade. With its flubbed intro and offkilter guitar leads, \"Confetti\" has a similarly boozy appeal, but the band proves more than capable of craft and finesse on \"Wave Pool\", which acknowledges Brian Wilson's infamous fear of the ocean by applying a Beach Boys melody to a suicidal love letter. So yeah, it's pure populism down to their lyrical concerns: girls, drinking, or being broke as fuck. Snyder surveys \"the caracass of my midtwenties\" during \"Lonesome Boring Summer\" and finds little but overlong naps and unpaid bar tabs. For a moment, 1,2,3 escape headlong into fantasia, wondering about Jack Bruce back in the record industry's days of \"golden yachts,\" (\"Riding Coach\") but rather than put forth a tonedeaf industry lesson, he admits his complicity in stealing his share of music. New Heaven's biggest liability is how frontloaded it is. Snyder does an admirable job breaking character and adapting his vocals to a droopy barroom drawl on \"Sorry, Soldier\", but his citric tone is occasionally an awkward fit on New Heaven's slowjamming back half, where the tempo and the melodies slack in lockstep. \"Just Like Heaven (Is Gone)\" and \"20,000 Blades\" are nice enough on their own, but they submit to a certain kind of wallflower indie rock formalism that the first half of the record merely flirts with. For a relatively new band, it's not so bad to be better at fitting in than standing out; in the case of 1,2,3, the songwriting chops are strong enough to give the impression they'll figure out how to be equally adept at both.
