{"label":" Kranky","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13022/homepage_large.a4787f22.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Masters","artist":"Christina Carter","title":"Original Darkness","text":" \"The white becomes the black/ The black becomes the white,\" sings Christina Carter to open Original Darkness. On paper, that couplet seems almost meaningless. But when delivered in her deliberate, haunting cadence, the words have a weight greater than their surface meaning it's an apt beginning to an album that derives power from simplicity. Through her solo work and as a member of Charalambides, Carter has long been an expert avantfolk minimalist, mining depth from small, repetitive songs. On Original Darkness she's developed this skill to nearperfection.Take the album's fourth track, \"ReFound Mary\". Here Carter strums a single acoustic chord, adding electric guitar flourishes that are nearly as repetitive. On top, she slowly breathes elongated syllables as if hypnotized, with lyrics so elusive they are almost nonsensical: \"I refound Mary/ In Forestville/ Cold pea princess/ Walking like a new mother.\" But her intensity makes the song an eerie meditation, so tense it could burst at any second.Original Darkness is filled with such potent moments. Carter builds each song with her acoustic guitar, one or two chords at time, then adds a restrained electric guitar or a chilly keyboard. The results are so entrancing that the album could have worked as a collection of instrumentals. But Carter's voice matches the music so well, these songs practically are instrumentals, saying more with sound than words.Those words skirt around their subjects evocatively, in a way perhaps best described as specific vagueness. This creates a sense of dislocation, even absence: \"We are losers  of ourselves/  In the car  on the road to our destination,\" she intones in \"Fountain of Youth\". Later, during the sparse, Loren Connorslike \"You Are So Far Away\", Carter stoically insists that \"The flow of time is so important/ And I'm never in it.\" And in \"Hidden Man\" she offers partial descriptions of an enigmatic figure, catching brief glimpses of his reflection.Even when Carter gets more direct, the power of her songs comes in what's unsaid. On \"Do Not Love a Woman\", she balances the title with a list of womanly things she does love, as if wholes aren't as important as unconnected parts. \"Capable of Murder\" is even more specific, but still leaves details aside in favor of emotion.The album ends with its prettiest piece, the hymnlike \"Do You Recognize My Voice?\" Over a soaring keyboard, Carter describes a voice that \"sounds like a voice I have heard before / All contained within a familiar voice/ The voices of women, the voices of men.\" Harmonizing with herself, Carter seems to suggest that she's found the key to all songs inside a single, simple melody. If that's her claim, it's hard to imagine a more convincing case than Original Darkness. "}
