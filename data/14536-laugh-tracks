Cohen's main band, the Fresh & Onlys, has been on a tear for the last two years releasing two fulllength records, an EP, a limited edition cassette, and countless 7\" singles worth of fuzzladen psychrock earworms. He still found time to go solo, too.Laugh Tracks, Cohen's second solo LP, is a mellow, summer record full of acoustic guitars, woozy brass, and faded vocal harmonies. It opens, rather appropriately, with the sound of ice cubes clinking in a glass. But other than the laid back vibe it's business as usual. The songs are simple and stripped down crafted fast and perfected later on, if perfected at all. Cohen's lyrics are sometimes simple streamofconsciousness nursery rhymes, likely rattled off at the moment of inspiration. \"Mother day/ Father night/ Just come together over me/ So that you would seem to be the same/ You should marry/ Be together forever,\" he sings on the opening track, \"Oh Oh Oh\".As the title implies, there are a few chuckles. Cohen has a good sense of how to make use of humor in music without descending into straightup wackiness. The slow and swaggering \"That's My Baby\" somehow straddles the line between clumsy midnight Stones puton and an earnest love song. It's goofy, but weirdly moving. Album closer \"Small Things Matter\" with its warbled vocals and earnestly inspirational message is a little more obviously a joke. \"How do you say to a child with clear eyes that lakes are no longer for swimming?/ How do you teach a tender young mind that TV is often misleading?\" sings guest vocalist Robert Cohen, only barely in key and a mile off of the beat.It's the ability to drift between parody and poignancy that gives Cohen a small edge on his peers bands like Blank Dogs, Thee Oh Sees, and King Khan. Sometimes, for a moment, the rockdude mask comes off. \"I Lifted My Arms\", a dreamlogic truckstop jam, has him at his best. \"I lifted my arms up to heaven and God then took me by the hand/ He tore my arms right off my body/ And placed upon me two golden wings/ Somebody teach me how to fly/ No one wants to know more than I,\" Cohen sings. It's a weird tune haunting but tender. It's nice to know that he can crank these out on the regular. "}
