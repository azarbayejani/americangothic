And for all the revelatory material on DâmFunk's watershed 2009 releases, his idiosyncratic take on vintage electrofunk had to come from somewhere. The Toeachizown series came across not just like a breakthrough, but a longbrewing culmination of a deep but largely backgrounded career. And the dude was old enough to come up in the rollerboogie era his current music pinpoints so distinctly can somebody's style really be retro if it's always been a part of him?Adolescent Funk sheds a bit of light on DâmFunk's underheard formative years, focusing on a series of demos and hometapes he made between 1988 and 1992. That period was a heady one for funk and R&B Michael Jackson and Prince running topspeed victory laps; Teddy Riley lighting new jack swing's fuse; gfunk reintroducing bounce to the airwaves and the songs on this comp reveal an enthusiastic kid with a Casio SK1 trying to figure out what he could learn from it all. How you hear this music really depends on whether you like late80s R&B enough to hear a promising amateur's take on it: \"Sexy Lady\", \"Raindrops\", and \"Attitude\" in particular have a certain Class of '89 vibe to them, though the best cut here, the hypnotic \"When I'm With U I Think of Her\", has all the qualities of a longlost lofi house classic.Not that his curriculum was limited to thencontemporary sounds. The \"Freak of the Week\"paraphrasing melody of \"I Like Your Big Azz (Girl)\" is the album's secondmost obvious nod to late70s Funkadelic (the collection's title being the first). And while it sounds like Sign 'O' the Times made an influential impression on DâmFunk, so did Dirty Mind: check the punchy new wave throb of \"It's My Life!\" A lot of the characteristics that manifested more strongly in Toeachizown were already in their prototype phase here, especially Dâm's ambidextrous, twokeyboard rhythmic counterpoints and his tendency to ride out grooves until their tightknit structure makes it feel like they're sprawling comfortably.Then there's another side of DâmFunk that didn't really manifest on Toeachizown his slickly jovial voice that raggedly combines R&B loverman smoothness with a sort of halfwaysqueaky funk archness. And while young Damon Riddick didn't quite have the vocal chops of, say, Al B. Sure!, his personality drives these songs enough to compensate for it. \"It's My Life!\", \"UCanDoItIfUWant2\", and \"I Love Life\" all ride on affirmations of proudly doing your own thing; the latter song even ends on a message against suicide. The love songs are a bit more angstridden the selfexplanatory \"Sexy Lady\" notwithstanding, most of them focus on disillusioned breakups (\"Do You Feel Like I Feel?\"), emotional clashes (\"Attitude\"), and restless dissatisfaction (\"When I'm With U I Think of Her\"). And then there's \"The Telephone Call\", where our protagonist is bothered by constant telephone calls (\"It must be a bitch\") when he's trying to work on his music. That it comes across as charismatic rather than selfabsorbed attests to how much fun Riddick must've been having putting all this together.Even so, the rawness of Adolescent Funk fits better as a point of origin for all the great stuff DâmFunk does now than as an actual complement to it. Stones Throw majordomo Peanut Butter Wolf picked out the tracks for this, and his judgment's trustworthy enough that I'm convinced this was the best stuff he could excavate. But even the choicest early demo tapes still sound like early demo tapes, and if the tape hiss on this doesn't distract you, the occasional trippedover beats and undercooked lyrics will. (If you ever want to hear how not to overreach on a drum solo, \"The Telephone Call\" is Exhibit A.) There's plenty here for raregroove enthusiasts with an 80s fixation and Toeachizown converts interested in a bit of backstory. But knowing where he's taken these sounds since then? It just makes you want to hear that funk all grown up. "}
