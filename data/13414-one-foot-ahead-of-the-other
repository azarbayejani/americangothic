New EP One Foot Ahead of the Other is Zomby's second stab at nonsingle formats, after last year's revivalist, acidspiked Where Were U in 92? More puttogether than a throwaway work but lacking any true coherence or an obvious standout to rally around, One Foot exists in a weird limbo.Title track excepted, One Foot mostly abandons the blankeyed vocal samples that gave Where Were U in 92? its slurred, sloganeering (\"Need Ur Lovin'\", \"B With Me\", etc.) feel. One Foot instead relies on Zomby's harried, stepwise sequences, resulting in trebly, kaleidoscopic melodies that, yes, sound not unlike those of a video game.This becomes a distraction early on One Foot, as \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Pumpkinhead's Revenge\", eerie sparse siblings, pit their pixilated, serpentine programs against one another. Listening to these note flurries is a little like watching a mother spider carry a few dozen children on her back: an impressive, intimidating act that offers lots of creepy motion but very little definition.Because Zomby favors brief, bright tracks (together, \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Pumpkinhead\" sum to just more than five minutes) he can mostly weather these missteps, though it's hard not to see those tracks and, later, the similar \"Mescaline Cola\" as twodimensional showpieces, lacking something to compliment their whizbang programming.Those tracks obscure One Foot's leaner, warmer tracks. \"Godzilla\" is prickly and resplendent, its opening moments revealing a stuttering beat and orbital melodies. \"Expert Tuition\" relies on a canned thud and soft, putty keyboards that Zomby stretches and snaps. The padded, pulsing tones of \"Firefly Finale\" feel like softpedaled trance for two minutes before they're snatched away. \"Polka Dot\" may come closest to advancing Where Were U's hurried floorsugar. \"Bubble Bubble\" pairs short, repeating melodic phrases to an offkilter drum track, the two occasionally slowing and syncopating. Fuck dancing, let's wig out.The title of this EP might initially seem to promise progress, something One Foot almost assuredly does not deliver. But given the phrase's usual usage that is, \"one foot ahead of the other, slowly now\" perhaps Zomby is hedging his bets. Just nine tracks and 26 minutes, One Foot feels like a stopgap (to wit: \"Polka Dots\" was streaming a year ago, and various other snippets and versions of these tracks have been floated). Zomby rode a wave of acclaim and stalwart singles to plenty of fanfare last year, but he's been mostly quiet in 2009. So One Foot feels like another step, finally, but only a very small one. "}
