Perhaps it's because Montreal is the North American metropolis with the most pronounced European influence, but even local bands of metal (Voivod), Britpop (the Dears), electropunk (Les Georges Leningrad), and populistindie (Arcade Fire) origin have embraced the genre's narrative qualities, intricate musicality, and theatricality. Montreal's Yamantaka//Sonic Titan are the latest torchbearers for the city's progandproud tradition. But where the most renowned progrock bands have introduced thematic frameworks into their music very gradually over the course several years remember, even Rush started out writing threeminute pop crotchrockers about wanting to get laid the conceptual scope and songcycle composition heard on YT//ST is the result of refinement and focus. To say the duo of Ruby Kato Attwood and Alaska B have lofty ambitions would be an understatement. Being of AngloAsian descent the former is JapaneseScottish, the latter ChineseIrish the two formed Yamantaka//Sonic Titan to address the duality of their cultural identities, as reflected in their band's double name, not to mention the tendency to appear in public sporting kabuki face paint and bikinis. Early shows were reportedly defined by decorative stage sets, performance art, homemade instruments made of trash and noisy experimentation, as the duo worked toward the goal of making its debut album a fullblown \"nohwave\" rock opera, titled Star. Now that YT//ST have solidified into an eightpiece rockband formation, they've issued this album as a 30minute preview of that larger, stillinprogress work. But the record feels wholly substantial and satisfying in its own right, and even those with no prior knowledge of YT//ST's history and elaborate intentions can just enjoy it for what it is: volcanic progrock colored with equal parts postpunk urgency, stonermetal heft, and psychedelic pop whimsy. Thanks to smart, brisk sequencing, the seven disparate songs presented here hang together as a seamless piece, even if the thematic devices linking them aren't so easy to discern: The tribalceremonial scene setter \"Queens\" offers references to ravens, snakes, hounds, and Alejandro Jodorowsky's surrealisthorror classicÂ The Holy Mountain, but it proves to be the only lyrically legible song on the album, as Ruby and Alaska become increasingly reliant on words of indeterminate language and ghostly harmonies. However, inscrutably titled songs like the funhousemirrored acidpop of \"Reverse Crystal//Murder of a Spider\" and the spaceage stomper \"Hoshi Neko\" nonetheless display an insidiously melodic quality that suggests Stereolab on steroids. And where these songs foreground YT//ST's eccentric side, the nightmarish, sevenminute colossus \"A Star Over Pureland\" showcases their command of brute physicality, pitting the ladies' echodrenched shrieks against a relentless, jackhammered fuzzmetal assault, like Flyera Yoko Ono waging war with Lightning Bolt. Yamantaka//Sonic Titan may still aspire to the sort of conceptual grandeur that requires an Olympic Stadium to contain it, but right now, what they're really good at is putting the \"raw\" in prog. "}
