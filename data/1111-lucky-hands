{"label":" Max Ernst","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/1104/homepage_large.de1e07c5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Mark Richardson","artist":"Thomas Brinkmann","title":"Lucky Hands","text":" Love that feeling, when the opening track is so thoroughly great on first hearing you just can't wait to hear the record that follows. \"Drops\" leads off Thomas Brinkmann's latest and it rips, the kind of rigidly funky early80s drums that made James Murphy pick up sticks as a teenager wedded to a minimal bass pulse, with fountains of jazzy variation coming from backwards beats and synth rushes that swoop down on the groove in hopes of tearing off a piece. Then the voice and nothing else: \"Drops\", which Brinkmannn eventually lets slip that the sample comes from a mentholyptus advertisement \"Mmmm medicated cough drops.\" Yes. Of late, Brinkmann prefers monkeying around to consistency. His last few albums have a few of these burners, a few experiments that sometimes fall flat, and then a number of punchy if not terribly memorable dubby techno tracks interspersed throughout. This time Brinkmann puts his spin on pop, incorporating vocals here and there and even going so far as to cover Morrissey. On \"The More You Ignore Me the Closer I Get\", Brinkmann brings in Natalie Beridze to sing, whom he knows from prior collaborations on her TBA project. While TBA's strange and unpredictable 2005 release Annul√© (also on Max Ernst) has something to recommend, as a vocalist Beridze is not much, with a style that basically consists of reciting words in a bored monotone. Electronic producers taking on the Smiths/Morrissey songbook has been an exciting minitrend in the last five years but this is a missed opportunity. Her contributions to the title track and \"Margins\" are slightly more interesting, perhaps because expectations are lower, but still not enough to make me wish for more.  Ignore these averageatbest moments and you have twothirds of an excellent album. The man himself sings on \"Maschine\", casting a goth shadow to a dense and bubbly techno concoction, but it's the vocalfree tracks that really affirm his talent. \"Jacknot\" actually works as a pop instrumental, with a progression and tunefulness that suggests an ace videogame theme expertly remixed for the dancefloor. \"Work\" is punchier than \"Drops\" and just as compelling, foregrounding Brinkmann's always propulsive programming. And really, for Brinkmann, that's the thing. His rhythm style has always brought to mind the word \"swing\" and on \"Charleston\" he makes it official, adding respectful but effective beats to a fully intact live performance of the tune by Django Reinhart. In this way Lucky Hands ends as good as it begins; shame about the sag in the middle.  "}
