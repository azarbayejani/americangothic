{"label":" Universal / SRC","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/1167/homepage_large.97dae74e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Julianne Shepherd","artist":"David Banner","title":"Certified","text":" David Banner is one of rap's most likeable figures, and also one of its most admirable. The consummate community activist this is a man who dispatched his own tour bus to relieve Katrina victims in Mississippi, fueling it with faith and a MasterCard...10 months after he chauffeured voters from his neighborhood to Election Day polls last November. As he told MTV during the announcement of a Hurricane Katrina benefit concert held by his youth network, Heal the Hood (healthehood.org), \"If I lie there and mope and don't get out there and be vocal, I'm really a detriment.\" Banner has the same qualities Kanye West is lionized for his production skills are as distinct as his diction with the added priceless earnings of massive hood clout. But his contradiction would probably be a tougher sell to Time, even apr√©sNBC commentary; to West's affable swagger, Banner offers murky nuance, no flinching, and a notalwaysfriendlysounding, hulking bark. So even where Certified doesn't entirely congeal, Banner gets by on personality and an eversharpening focus and the man knows how to throw out a lede. Within the first few seconds of Mississippi: The Album, Banner'd pronounced he \"feel[s] the pain of slavery\"; Certified opens with \"Lost Souls\", a mournful statement of purpose spat gruffly over guitar. \"This is for my thug niggas/ All the pimps and the drug dealas/ Thieves and the motherfuckin killas/ Most of y'ain't neva had shit/ That's why we get crunk in this bitch,\" the chorus goes, after which the nascent connectthedots sociology comes fullthrottle: \"Daddy in the pen/ Mama out suckin' dick/ I ain't never had them/ So I ride with my click/ And I'd die for my click.\" Banner's anguish and aggression is central. Never menace, though; beneath Banner's gruff veneer resides a borderline absurdist with unending charisma. He calls himself the \"weird o.g.\" and on Certified he reconfirms it, with heartrending quirky lines like, \"My love was novice like the left side on my controller of my Atari\" and \"I didn't wanna be cryin'...in front of our kids/ But we don't have none\" (both from \"Thinking of You\", a sad rap about a shorty squandered, a soul mate cheated away). And still, Banner is a man whose eyes, clear with the sting of misery, aim heavenward. The liner notes in Certified begin by quoting the Talmud, and end by mythologizing Banner's home state of Mississippi, also the namesake of his last two albums, as \"the place where pain lurked around every corner on the branches of every tall tree, and on the backs of my people...I was born out of that pain. Thank you.\" Thus the sound of Certified, largely produced by Banner himself, is steeped in emotive acoustic guitar and fleshy electric solos, earmarking the South's musical legacy, fragments tumbling into its future of synth lines that squiggle like flickers of neon crunk, the thickness, the heat. At times the synth, acoustic thrum, and riffage intersect, particularly on the album finale \"Crossroads\", Banner's nod to the devil, Robert Johnson, mainstream alternative radio, and \"Amazing Grace\". It's a grinding, gymsocksmetal track ready to fermoozle ClearChannel by pantomiming Linkin Park but promising liberation; Banner laments, \"I wish I could call Jesus up on the phone like, 'Lord, still burnin' from the slave trade/ Can't reproduce cause our folks got AIDS.\" Meanwhile its chorus promises, \"We were blind, now we see, in the end we will be free.\" The concept is impressive, and beatwise it's a flagpole stuck out in the heavymetal green, demarking Banner's farflung range as both producer and fan. But, as Banner finetunes his mostly deadserious themes propped by adventurous beats, the rapper's bombast doesn't always cover for his inconsistencies, and sometimes Certified buckles under the breadth of his production. But then, bombast goes a long way see the stellar \"Ain't Got Nothin'\", costarring Magic and Lil Boosie; \"Treat Me Like a Pimp\", featuring Jadakiss, his Northern counterpart in the crushedglassvoice contest; and the Twista collaboration \"On Everything\", a footballfield burner with the ubiquitous and everlovable marching band backup. When Banner's on, he's on: \"I'm the new Nat Turner,\" he claims on \"Ridin'\". \"Spread something to the kids like Sojourner, man: the Truth.\" Blam. Set atop a molasses chorus, guest rappers Dead Prez do his line justice with their trad antiwhitey, Pantherthrowback Black Nationalist proclamations, though an oversyllabic, doubletime verse by Talib Kweli stumbles. Which is also to say: Southern guest stars abound B.G., Marcus, Three 6 Mafia, 8Ball and MJG, Bun B, Gangsta Boo, his former Crooked Lettaz cohort Kamikaze in a chain of Southrepping tracks interrupted only by \"Westside\", the weird but cute homage to Cali rappers and their legacy. Banner's bleak landscape is an eerie forewarning in a time when rappers have been more instrumental to the South's \"reconstruction,\" so Bush snakily put it, than FEMA. As Banner himself asked, \"How can a socalled 'gangsta rapper' react quicker to a crisis than our own government\"? The answers are all over Certified, the South's first postKatrina album. America: fuck yeah. "}
