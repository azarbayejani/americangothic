{"label":" Stones Throw","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/9616/homepage_large.cc5e8d8a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Sam Chennault","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Stones Throw: Ten Years","text":"  A silent bboy constantly traversing the outer regions of music and headspace. A shadowy exNative Tongue consort resurrected behind an inchthick metal mask. A vinyl archeologist from Tennessee entrusted with resurrecting a lost tribe of hiphop architects. The child of a musical legend who mixes acid rock with bedtime stories and is forgotten for two decades. And, finally, a DJ who took refuge in underground ethics after seeing his career deteriorate and his partner murdered. This isn't your usual indie hiphop crew, so it should be no surprise that this Stones Throw retrospective isn't your typical hits comp. It's odd and unpredictable, with most tracks culled from the margins of their catalog. But the label has always focused on Peanut Butter Wolf and Egon's evangelical zeal for obscurity, so this disc rightly feels like more of a personal scrapbook than a public document. After all, Stones Throw obsesses over cultural quips the asides that were either never heard or understood, oftentimes not even by their creators. And the most interesting cuts here are halfformed ideas, tangents too awkward for mass consumption. The creepy New Wave of Gary Wilson's \"Gary's in the Park\" sounds like a collaboration between Devo and Norman Bates, while Stark Reality's \"Comrades and Dreams\" is preschool psych, mingling innocence and fear. Sure, some of it's more interesting than listenable, but there are moments of beauty that need no footnotes: Madlib's achingly strained strings on \"Falling\" juxtaposed against Dudley Perkins' gravelly pleads; Koushik's airy acoustic pop on \"Be With\".  Few of these are obvious picks for a Stones Throw comp the only nobrainers are Jaylib's \"The Red\", with its vintage Dilla production, and Lootpack's \"Whenimondamic\", an early classic from the label's breakout artist, Madlib. On one hand, this sort of focus is necessary. After all, the label's masterworks Quasimoto's The Unseen, Madvillain's Madvillainy, J. Dilla's Donuts are concept albums, cohesive and whole works that defy atomization. When taken out of context, they lose their power.  Still, one wonders why Quasimoto's \"Low Class Conspiracy\" was chosen over, say, the desolate French Pop/Blaxploitation mashup of \"Come on Feet\", or why a Bside remix of Madvillain's \"Figaro\" was picked instead of the more celebrated \"All Caps\" or \"Accordion\". But this is the iPod age, and there are probably thousands of unofficial Stones Throw comps floating around. This is a more personal perspective from a label that focuses on the margins.  "}
