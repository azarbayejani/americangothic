Hell, even my illfated allBlondie ska band, One Way or Your Mother, came close to inking a deal with Capitol back in the day. Longing for an earlier time, perhaps, or maybe sensing the pop/punk (or punk/pop) revival that draws inevitably near as a counterresponse to emo's hyper sincerity, Lookout! Records has taken the initiative and released a remastered and expanded version of the Mr T Experience's 1995 EP ...And the Women Who Love Them. They're a bit early, sure, but that's so they can say they were doing it before it was cool.\"Give us a cheeky cover of Duran Duran's 'Is There Something I Should Know?'!\", the clamoring masses will shout. \"Got it right here,\" Lookout! will duly respond.\"How about a snotty version of Elton John and Kiki Dee's doeeyed duet 'Don't Go Breaking my Heart'?\" \"Again, got you covered.\" If things keep going the way they are, we might even see a resurgence of the word \"alternative\" in pop music parlance (remember when it meant something?) in which case, MTX will surely be poised to end all their encores with the anthemic \"Alternative is Here to Stay\". \"Man, were these boys prescient?\" we'll ask. A veritable Oracle of Delphi, this band. Yeah, you might as well jump on the wagon early and pick up a copy of this expanded EP. After all, besides the seven songs that appeared on the original, you'll now get 18 (!) more contemporaneous seveninch singles, demos and outtakes from the sessions, and various comp appearances spanning from 19931997 which, for bargainbin prices, is more Mr T Experience than you could ever possibly need. Still, taken a song at a time, this stuff's pretty damn fun. It's your basic Ramones/Buzzcocksdescended punk rock, but the lyrics are great if you've ever been dumped (\"My new girlfriend is better than you/ She's got bigger breasts and a higher IQ,\" from \"New Girlfriend\") or have found a new love just as pathetic as you are (\"You're much more than MST3K or D&D;/ I'm King Dork and I want you to be my queen\"). So, alright, maybe you'll never want to listen to this EP straight through, but it's perfect fodder between Smiths and Cure songs on that mixtape you're making for that girl you have a crush on. She'll think it's old Green Day, and you'll appear smart when you tell her about MTX and how they came from the same scene but were first. Plus, their Mr T reference predates Inspecta Collect. You're in, dude, you're so in. "}
