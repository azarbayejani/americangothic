I could just be taking them way too seriously or my sense of humor could be broken. An eightpiece rap crew from Wales known for cheap jewelry and coining useful slang like \"soap bar\" and \"safe as fuck,\" they make their U.S. debut with Straight Outta Newport. Their delivery is painful, the beats are outdated and ridiculous, one of them sounds deadon like the Cookie Monster (and in the Muppet way, not the death metal vocals way), and their humor is gradeschool level no better than whatever you may have laid down the first time you discovered a tape recorder. Am I missing something? Are they the ones having the last laugh? Maybe they're far more clever than I realize. Maybe they want to bring us back to a more innocent time, a Golden Age of Novelty Rap, when anybody could rap regardless of skill, from the Chicago Bears to Bart Simpson to the Fresh Prince. In which case, their clumsy flow which makes Mike Skinner look like Twista would be essential to the execution. A song called \"Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do\" really would be best delivered by a guy who sounds like Rik from \"The Young Ones\". It's probably another clever layer when their strongest beat is saved for a track called \"Your Mother's Got a Penis\". If you're curious how that one goes, it's hard to miss: \"I can prove it cause I gave it a blow/ It was purely accidental 'cause she got me really drunk/ And she made me kiss her elephant trunk/ You know why?/ [pause] That's right/ [pause] Your mother's got a penis.\" But in between songs about hermaphroditic mothers and sex with computers (\"Half Man, Half Machine\") there's sincere songs like \"Roller Disco\", which sounds like and is about just that. When they rap that they \"used to listen to Public Enemy, Eric B and Rakim,\" I guess I should take them at their word, even though none of it managed to rub off. For better or worse ok, just worse there's no irony here; This really is the best they could do. Too juvenile to be offensive, and too dull to milk cheap laughs from playing into stereotype, Goldie Lookin' Chain make one serious mistake in this novelty rap game: They're just not funny. "}
