{"label":" Hardly Art","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/18203/homepage_large.bbb998c3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Seapony","title":"Falling","text":" The recent news that Best Coast would be opening up a leg of Green Day's massive arena tour came like a splash of Pacificblue clarity. And that was before Billie Joe Armstrong's onstage tirade forced him to check into substanceabuse treatment. If Seapony were to land a revealingly complementary, highprofile opening slot of their own, it would have to be for the xx. This Seattlebased, flyovercountrybred band's Hardly Art debut, last year's Go With Me, showed a similar commitment to intimacy and understatement. But where the influential British trio draws more from cluboriented sounds, Seapony unshowily and agreeably extend a wispy, reverbprone indie pop tradition that spans from Marine Girls, Young Marble Giants, and Talulah Gosh to the Field Mice or the Softies and on through the 21stcentury likes of the Postmarks, Headlights, and Tennis. If you happen to have an itch for a specific kind of yearning, autumnsunset guitarpop which, admittedly, I do well, this should scratch it nicely. Recorded again at home, the 12song, 36minute effort refines the simple style Seapony set out on first Go With Me single \"Dreaming\", now with additional polish courtesy of the mixers at Olympia's Dub Narcotic Studios. The core duo of Jenny Weidl and Danny Rowland trade off on flickering, SmithsmeetsVentures guitar leads and strums that are either jangly or distorted (or both), as their longtime friend Ian Brewer adds unassuming basslines, over drum tracks that this time are more organicsounding. Even the relatively uptempo tracks, like the notsopatientlywaiting neopsych strummer \"What You Wanted\" or thumping sadsack's lament \"Never Be\", have a satisfingly misty quality. And when Seapony finetune their muted palette whether with the screeching sound effects on the credulous \"Be My Baby\"beat \"Tell Me So\" or the more direct, confident vocals on acousticleaning \"See Me Cry\" it mostly works. Meanwhile, if the album title carries over to the lyrics, which are written and quietly sung by Weidl, love isn't all that's being fallen into. Sure, \"Follow\" plays winsomely with the homophonic closeness between \"fall for you\" and \"follow you,\" but the languid \"Fall Apart\" is a reverbsprawled reverie on lost love. Lyrical mentions of \"falling\" stretch, too, to the atmospheric, drummachinecentered \"Be Alone\" except here it's more like falling through space, as Weidl sings that \"everyone would rather be alone.\" It'd certainly be fair to call Falling lowstakes, and it's also fair to long a bit for songs that are somewhat more distinctive, moods that are less uniform. But in the world of bedroom loners suggested here, outside opinions might not be especially relevant and, in fact, could be missing the point. Thus, the key track, the sneakily catchy \"No One Will\", which approaches the same question from a different angle: \"It took forever to find somebody/ It took forever to leave this room/ What can we do?\" Whether meeting a lover or growing an audience, Falling suggests, you can't change where you're coming from. To Seapony's credit and perhaps slight detriment, their essence so far is subdued pleasure; they might not go crazy for you, but they know the only place for themselves almost too well. "}
