{"label":" Soul Jazz","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/1982/homepage_large.1e82c2ad.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Peter Macia","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Big Apple Rappin'","text":" In his 2005 book of photography, A Time Before Crack, Jamel Shabazz collected images from New York City during the embryonic days of hiphop, preheatedcokeexplosion. It's a pageturner of borough teens in tight jeans, shells, Clydes, and Cazals, rocking boomboxes and beltbuckle nameplates. Not much has changed then, other than pervasive crackrhetoric in raps and, of course, all the crack, which itself cuts trends, shunts history, and supplies the nostalgic weight to backintheday comps like Big Apple Rappin', a stack of some of hiphop's earliest pressings. But the songs here are more than rosetinted artifacts. While they do convey the blitheness before \"The Message\", they also dispel myths about hiphop's natal innocence, naivetÂŽ, and homogeneity. Most importantly though, for songs built specifically nottolast, some still sound pretty fresh. Not all timeless, some are what they are, sevenminute onetake prattling over interpolated disco r&b; (sounds cooler than it is) recorded to fill one side of a 12\". Most tedious of these are the title track by Spyder D, clocking in at 10plus minutes of repping every block and crew in NYC (Ashford & Simpson?), and Nice and Nasty 3's \"The Ultimate Rap\", which at nine minutes tests the patience for Cheryl Lynn. Not to take anything away from their place in history, but they are museum pieces. Less dusty is Masterdon & The Def Committee's \"Funkbox Party\", which features a classic 808 under the fastraps of Gangster Gee and the original hardspitting female, Pebblee Poo, who'd already spent time in Kool Herc's Herculoids. But the selections aging best are the ones that were idiosyncratic from the jump. Spoonie Gee's \"Spoonin' Rap\" is a nineminute echoplexed rant that starts with copping feelings on girls to catching feelings from dudes in prison. There's a lesson there. The ladies are more than objects here, though, as Xanadu supply Debbie Harry with a style, and Universal 2 are protoSaltNPepa. Consciousrap is covered by Brother D & the Collective Effort, and the Fly Guys' highonlife whisper song, which relies on a knocking milk bottle. Connecting the dots between the Bronx and Kingston are General Echo's \"Rapping Dub Style\", lazing horns and diddlydees included, and the Jamaica Girls' \"Rock The Beat\", nonrapped but likeminded. So on a compilation of hiphop's dawn, you've got live bands, drum machines, politics, nonsense, misogyny, homophobia, and partying, all set to dance music, some of it stolen wholesale from its origins. Just saying. Regardless, Soul Jazz once again give us clear versions of rare gems and essentials, packaged with loads of interviews, photos and old show flyers, courtesy the relentless research of Johan \"Google Me\" Kugleberg. Not just for old folks, Big Apple Rappin' still manages to party fairly hard, although it probably shouldn't have tried to get into those Jordaches. "}
