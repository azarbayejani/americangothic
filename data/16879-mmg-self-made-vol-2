{"label":" Warner Bros. / Maybach","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/18055/homepage_large.0764c7f3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Various","title":"MMG Presents: Self Made 2","text":" Less than a year ago, Rick Ross nearly died. The cause and convalescence couldn't be more true to form: After suffering a series of seizures on a private plane, Rozay gave the biggest middle finger to Father Time by taking pictures at a motherfucking Wingstop with DJ Khaled mere hours later. And then Rich Forever came out in January, a 79minute Robb Reportstyle brag that recommended you try the lemon pepper at one of his Wingstop franchises while finding it unnecessary to mention his brush with death.  Then there was another potentially crippling headline, the one that revealed that Ross' Maybach Music Group label is named after a car that as of 2011 is no longer manufactured because it was apparently a horribly made automobile that almost nobody could afford. The latter half of Maybach's demise makes it a perfect inspiration for a hiphop collective's name, but it also reveals MMG's formative flaw: Ross had every reason to claim \"excess is just my character\" on Kanye's \"Devil in a New Dress\", and his voice, lyrics, and life in general embody the absurd luxury signified by \"Maybach Music.\" But on Self Made 2, he shares the spotlight with his bluecollar, modestly striving underbosses Wale, Stalley, and Meek Mill, who appear on the same beats sounding like they got there because they've won a game show. However, now that they're here, you can sense they feel an utter lack of competition both internally and externally, a problem signified by \"Power Circle\", one of the best cuts on the tape and the most illustrative of MMG's failings. Featuring a sterling verse from every MMG member as well as Gunplay and Kendrick Lamar, it should feel like an event given its eight and half minute runtime. Yet it's not an \"event\" so much as a pretty good MMG track that also happens to be absurdly long for no real reason; no one ever gives the impression that something's at stake here, failing to play off or build upon one another. MMG has chemistry, but no volatility. Which is a strange thing to say about a crew that has Gunplay on the payroll. \"Power Circle\" is actually credited to Gunplay and rightfully so, since he delivers a verse of pantheon, loosecannon boasting (\"WHERE'S YOUR SEAT AT? WHERE'S YOUR LOBSTER? WHERE'S YOUR SEABASS?\"). He and Ross should compose a classic Rae/Ghost, Gucci/Flocka dynamic, but Gunplay wouldn't be nearly as thrilling if you really thought rules and hierarchies applied to him. You sense that he's in MMG but doesn't totally buy into it. He's criminally underutilized here, sounds completely out of place when he does show up, and there's no reason he needs to be trading bars with goonsforhire like Ace Hood on \"Black on Black\". Still, everyone clearly needs to be subservient to Ross and even if Self Made comes to life every time he shows up, he's not wasting his best stuff here, refusing to let coherence get in the way of saying the most ridiculous baller shit possible. Observe: \"My bank account Jewish,\" which I assume he means in a totally opposite way than Malice did, and as far as \"My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money\" (the hook from \"Bag of Money\", natch) goes, I don't think women like being compared to formless sacks, but Ross really likes money, so a compliment's a compliment. But it'll be years before any of us can even remotely ascertain what exactly he means by \"The square root of a kilo is me!!!\" and that moment serves as the peak of Self Made. It happens within the first 20 seconds. From there on out, Stalley and Wale take up the majority of Self Made and they can be considered complementary in some aspects: Wale fears his \"haters wanna see me catch diabetes from humble pie,\" whereas Stalley totally carb loads on it. \"Lost in the instrumental/ Keys got me sentimental\" is Stalley's M.O. not just on \"Fountain of Youth\" but in general, and while he's ostensibly meant to contribute ballast to Ross' hot air, his relentless selfeffacement can be a drag. As for Wale, he remains an undeniably talented MC bent on constructing the least likeable persona in all of hiphop. He's still humanized by some beyond goofy punchlines like \"shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealin' my Thunder.\" Wale sounds utterly joyless while popping bottles, tags, and bras, but in some sad way, you almost have to admire the sheer pomposity dedicated to the tyrannical ignorance of \"Actin' Up\" (hook: \"These hoes be actin' up/ And these niggas be lettin' 'em\"). Mill is the guy who's actually done the most to distinguish himself as a solo artist on these tapes. Though the first Self Made was also pretty lackluster, Mill's \"Tupac Back\" willed its way into memeworthy ubiquity, and the obvious task is to find something similar here. The bombastic \"Black Magic\" comes close and it's the standout on Self Made, but it's less down to Mill's doubletime showmanship than Ross' \"woop!\" on the hook; much like \"Tupac Back\", Mill still feels like the featured artist even though the song is technically his. Otherwise, it's hard to find much else that really sticks \"I Be Puttin' On\" and \"Bag of Money\" feature topshelf rap/R&B hookmen (Roscoe Dash, TPain) but only halffinished hooks. French Montana charms with some heavylidded guest spots and new signing Omarion sounds suspiciously like Frank Ocean these days. Though it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't prefer even more rote \"I'm Not a Star\" reduxes as a replacement for O's perfectly competent and forgettable solo joints. Of course, it's important that Self Made. 2 actually exists to forcefeed Hot 97 playlists rather than doing something other than coast off career momentum. These sort of label showcases have a long and not particularly illustrious history, and while it'd be nice to hear MMG follow the template set by the Ruff Ryders comps and take some wild production chances, or imitate the Diplomatic Immunity series by developing a functional team gameplan, it really doesn't do much to signal the demise of MMG any more than the actual shuttering of Maybach. Those dud singles Ross has been releasing from God Forgives, I Don't those we should worry about. "}
