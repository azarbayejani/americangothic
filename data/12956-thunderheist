{"label":" Big Dada","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/13956/homepage_large.8982db73.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Adam Moerder","artist":"Thunderheist","title":"Thunderheist","text":" Equally decorative as it is disparaging, the term \"hipster rap\" comes off Toronto duo Thunderheist like cartoon stink lines. On the mic, frontlady Isis is so deadpan you wonder if she even knows it, especially when championing sex and conspicuous consumption with the aplomb of a Top 40 rapper. Producer Grahm Zilla shows off a deep record collection spanning from disco to Detroit techno to old school hiphop, though his retro rehashing lacks the obsessive enthusiasm of fellow indie rap acts Lupe Fiasco and the Cool Kids. While these factors are likely to scramble your posteverything irony circuits, the sad fact is that Thunderheist lack the artistry for something as nuanced as hipster rap, and they're probably just a broad rap act that's too drab for mainstream success.When your big blogosphere splash is a thugged out take on \"Sweet Dreams\" like Thunderheist's 2007 single \"Sue√±os Dulces\", you're already standing on pretty shaky ground. On their first fulllength, the duo still can't hone a shtick of their own, relying instead on a bland mix of homage and innocuous oneliners. \"Jerk It\" tries to shock in the vein of Peaches or CSS but comes off as polite recommendation, made even more hohum by its cadence, which apes Missy Elliot's \"Work It\". Most of Isis's lyrics dwell on similarly obvious and wellexamined arguments like \"sex is desirable,\" \"dancing is fun,\" or \"shiny things are nice to own.\" Sure, there's \"Freddie\", which gently taunts an aging cokehead, but most of the tracks here seem intended to cheerlead for drunk, horny people already on the dancefloor.Mr. Zilla keeps the album's head above water with a couple electro gems that accommodate the garden variety lyrics. Sparks fly on \"Nothing 2 Step 2\" and \"Space Cowboy\", two searing electrodance numbers sharing the amphetamine restlessness of Crystal Castles or Vitalic. Closer \"Anthem\" provides too little variation too late, but its Justiceesque arenatechno posturing at least shows glimpses of stronger material to come. Still, with its unchecked endorsement of bullmarket indulgence and broad creative strokes, Thunderheist's first offering feels hollow. Isis doesn't shed light on her own character with origin stories or \"my x is better than your x\" braggadocio, and Zilla's literal take on his influences can feel downright algorithmic at times, like a RIYL music app. While this sort of proactive fandom hardly qualifies as bad art, you'd have to get pretty smashed to ignore the album's missing spirit and just dance, which, sadly, may be the point here.
