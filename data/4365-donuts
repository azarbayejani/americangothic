In fact, Dilla, if anything, is imposing a metarap bent on neosoul, assaulting the senses in ways unseemly for a guy who used to work with QTip. The drums, though remarkably fluid, are lighter, domineered by dense, abrasive samples that are sequenced with a sense of swing. Percussive end pieces are shorn cheesegrater sharp, then appended to sickly spliced moans. The end result is akin to Norman Smith and DJ Shadow sitting in on a RZAproduced session spry, voiceless proghop by any other name. Opener \"Workinonit\" comes on like a Rubinproduced take on Schoolhouse Rock. Clangy guitars give way to doubledup groans and what sounds like a backmasked Zulu chant. The sample, supplied by '60s soulsters Them, is diced with manic precision, and around the 2:00 mark, the melody builds to a climax, fading, with echoy vocal bits, into bodiless abyss. Equally engaging is \"AntiAmerican Graffiti\", which combines lightersup, lovenotwar humility with a track both wistful and worldweary: A crazed voice spouts endoftheworld admonishments like some disenfranchised apparition, colliding with somber guitars. \"Don't Cry\" finds Dilla taking sprightly, blulite soul crooning and flipping it countercockeyed: \"If Blue Magic or Whoever could see me now!\" First he plays the original, then throws in the \"Now, you play it and I'll show you how my voice would have made it unbelievable!\" bit, before gently lifting its face off. It's chest thumping, to be sure, like the Copa shot in Goodfellas or Bigger and Deffer. And it's courteous. Similarly cordial is \"Time: The Donut of the Heart\", where he turns the Jackson 5's \"All I Do Is Think of You\" into a lucid dream the song's intro is now with the chorus it always coveted. Says ?uestlove: \"[J Dilla] time compresses Michael and Jermaine's adlibs with the uneasy ease of a tightropewalker, with oil shoes on, crossing one 90story building to another, after eight shots of [Patrone].\" I'm sayin'. Not that Donuts deals with only obvious sample sources \"The Twister (Huh, What)\" is the sound of flusick flutes chiming in time to a busted weathervane; \"Waves\", a hiccuping Hare Krishna class. It's Dilla's showandtell method, however, that's most effective, because it illustrates how he's, more or less, upgrading soul music we get to see how he unpacked its bag, what spots he told it it missed. This approach also allows Dilla to pay homage to the selfsame sounds he's modernized; the drums are light, to reflect the original sound from which he's borrowing. In that sense, Donuts is pure postmodern art which was hiphop's aim in the first place. "}
