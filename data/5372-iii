Prepare yourselves for a fakejournalism megapun that emulates the stylings of the bikinibaiting Entertainment Tonight; I'm talking cleverness on par with \"'Friends' Star Matthew Enjoying Rehab 'Perry' Much\". Ready? \"Moistboyz Have Dried Up.\" Get it? Because moisture can dry! Hoo, boy! This golden stuff just comes to me, even with a sinus infection. I'll give you a minute to clean your pants. Yawn. I know this Ween side project is supposed to be a spoof, but the best spoofs transcend their targets. If you're going to dip down into genremuck, you should be careful not to get any on you. Moistboyz are starting to sound the opposite of inspired, as idealess as the sociopathic thrash pose they're aiming to lampoon. And this is coming from a devoted showtaping Weenie, who signed on with their debut and kept smiling along as they worshipped cosmic stallions and delivered doomed monologues from the perspective of children with spinal meningitis. I keep a pocketsized carbondating kit handy to annoy Christians and to test the vintagicity of thriftstore denim jackets. When I played this album into it, the thing thought 2002's III was at least ten years old, with certain moments going farther back into the wanky eras of Judas Priest and W.A.S.P. No fooling, the Moistboyz concept (profane, insanely distorted chunks of standard bragandthreat metal vitriol) ages aggressively, the same way sports highlights from a noon game look like they were filmed during the Korean War when they're replayed at midnight, isolated as they are from their only momentary significance/payoff. Fun is to be had on this disc, though: every echoed handclap is guffawinducing. The hellish \"Yeah!\" that opens \"The Spike\" (with its characteristic chorus, \"The spike! The spike!\") legitimately induces furnitureburning. \"The Tweaker\" is a keeper, with its authentically chaotic guitar wail and bullying tempo. The song is hilarious, if manifestly impolitic, as it chronicles people vomiting up their testicles, Satan assisting with drug acquisition, brittle penises falling off on contact, and tips to avoid being a \"hippie faggot\". The centerpiece is \"I'm Gonna Kick Your Ass\", as it flagrantly cops the second half of the riff from \"Iron Man\" and boasts lyrics such as \"Talkin' that shit you're mine!\" and my favorite: \"Asshole/ The shit is going down right now/ Put down the kid and run/ Daddy's gonna die/ Wave byebye.\" But puerile thunder can only rumble so long, and ultimately, this project suggests the unfunniness of Tenacious D's valleys, or a backwardsmoving Ween, as if they're overrevisiting their early work. Moistboyz just performed a show they billed as \"Retardapalooza\", and that's a clue as to just how \"Beavis & Butthead\"/Spencer Gifts this album can be. The human rhythm section sounds unpromisingly like drum machine programming (a la mid90s Al Jourgensen), which makes the rock seem strangely contained, like havoc trapped in a Skinner box. Titles such as \"Great American Zero\" and \"I Am the Reaper\" should be sufficient to communicate how tired things get. The lyrics intermittently scan as clunkily as the predictable doggerel people send in to newspapers' obituary sections. If you still go around ranking your top ten farts or playing mailbox baseball, or if you want cartoonmorbid songs about eating Mickey Moist's leavings, purchase away. Else, leave it for someone's tenyearold brother. "}
