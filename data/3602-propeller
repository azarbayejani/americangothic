Deusner","artist":"Guided By Voices","title":"Propeller","text":" At this very moment, there is an original pressing of Propeller selling on eBay with a starting price of $850. In his new history of the band, Guided by Voices: 20 Years of Hunting Accidents in the Forests of Rock and Roll, James Greer tells of a copy that eventually sold for more than $6,000. It's not hard to see why these records are so costly and coveted: Only 500 were pressed in 1992, and band members and assorted hangerson decorated each of them by hand, mimicking Robert Pollard's collagestyle graphics, in the process making each one unique. In its 13 years of existence, Propeller has been much more lovingly preserved on vinyl than on compact disc. For years, I only knew it as the other half of Vampire on Titus, which always made me recall Big Star's #1 Record and Radio City (both bound together on the same disc, still awaiting separate deluxe reissues). That's good company, and an appropriate connection, but for me, Propeller always suffered the proximity of the disinviting Vampire on Titus, as fanged an album as its title implies. Now, with Scat Records reissuing Propeller, the emphasis is again squarely on vinyl. The CD version has nice new packaging featuring several of Pollard's collages, essentially enabling you to choose your own cover. But it pales in comparison to the LP itself, which includes an insert with 81 of the original collage covers and reproduces the #14 cover (\"50 EGGS\") and the boxing diagrams in their original 12\"x12\" dimensions. Despite its release during the heyday of the compact disc, Propeller seems to be an album primarily intended for vinyl and its enthusiasts; any other medium remains an afterthought. The music that goes on vinyl also comes from vinyl: Propeller sounds like a sonic collage gathered from what would seem like an exhaustive collection of 70s rock LPs Cheap Trick, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Todd Rundgren, John Lennon, maybe even some Wings. On Propeller these periodrock influences are closer to the surface than on subsequent GbV albums. It's Pollard's first big rock statement, from the crowd chants that open side one to the anthemic guitar chords that end side two. As such, it's a little rough here and there, its slight imperfections alternately amplified and pardoned by its lofi sound, but ultimately it remains insistent and compelling. Bee Thousand is written about more often and exalted more devotedly (and rightly so), but Propeller proves just as essential to the Guided by Voices mythos. More than that, it's just a solid rock album, one that gives you all the tools you need to understand and appreciate it. Enjoying it should be easy. \"G! B! V! G! B! V!\" the crowd chants at the beginning of \"Over the Neptune\", and presumably it's Pollard who yells, \"Are you ready to rock?\" That's a bold, somewhat selfdeprecating kickoff for a band whose audience at the time barely extended beyond Ohio and who were pressing only 500 copies of what they wanted to be their breakthrough album. But that introduction not only predicts the obsessive cult that would gradually surround Pollard, but it also prefaces a medley (\"Over the Neptune\" bleeds neatly and dramatically into \"Mesh Gear Fox\") that contains the whole of Pollard's large and complex philosophy about rock and roll and about the inspiration he derives from a live crowd (\"It's the way you look it's the way you act when you're near me,\" he sings at the song's climactic push). Those chanting voices are the ones that guide him, and here they usher you into Pollard's world, where you learn to decipher his coded lyrics and speak his rock language.Propeller achieves what Pollard calls on \"Weedking\" a \"violent pace.\" That song picks up where \"Over the Neptune/Mesh Gear Fox\" leaves off in full rock anthem mode. It begins with the rallying cry, \"Long live Rockathon\", which is both a shoutout to the band's fledgling minilabel and a concise summation of a credo for long, beery live shows. With its affectionately recreated Beatles harmonies, the chorus of \"Quality of Armor\" reappears precipitously throughout the song, slyly inverting the comeon of \"Drive My Car\". \"Metal Mothers\" bleeds pop melancholia, and the popping guitar melody of \"Unleashed! The Largehearted Boy\" creates a bouncy momentum that carries into \"Exit Flagger\", with its unannounced and powerful racing=death metaphor. After the perfect adolescent wistfulness of \"14 Cheerleader Coldfront\", Propeller trails off as it makes its way to the finish line. Still, after the odd collage \"Ergo Space Pig\", \"Circus World\" and \"Some Drilling Implied\" give the band a chance to run through more guitar solos, breakdowns, rock dramatics that you'd think lofi was capable of sustaining. But the sound preempts any chance of irony all those rock anthems, monumental choruses, and microphone windmills are completely from the boy's large heart. That's the key to the band's appeal, the factor often missed or simply left unstated: Pollard believes in rock and roll, and Propeller is his sacrifice on the altar. And that lofi sound is essential: it preserved the illusion of connection between performer and listener, hinting at an intimacy that Pollard knows doesn't exist, but damned if he isn't going to try.
