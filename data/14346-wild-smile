Just over a year ago, the Brooklyn indie rock outfit released its debut EP. It was buoyant and sweet and ended on one very high note: \"It Gets Your Body Movin'\". The song is an arminarmer, a slowburning summer anthem whose titular chorus demanded you sing along even if you weren't surrounded by friends. The guitars were light and clean, but you could smell the booze on every single member's breath, from the first chant to the widemouthed coda. Now that song sits at the halfway point of Wild Smile, Suckers' first fulllength and an effort that bubbles with the same wingnut energy that debut EP did. Its homestretch is still a revelation, and it's not the only one to be found herein. Wild Smile is wild indeed, the band's aesthetic and feel summed up perfectly by the cover art.The trick is variety. Few songs (see: the forgettable \"King of Snakes\") break free of the same blueprint build gradually, build casually, and then get everyone together for a grand finale. Each is constructed the same way, but check out how Suckers decorate the dynamics. Opener \"Save Your Love for Me\" kicks off in softrock fashion, swaying just until the drums kick, the guitars gain Neil Younglike heft, and the vocals are vaulted into operatic heights. Listen closely and you'll hear a guitar lick that was ripped from an Oasis song. But what's remarkable is how much each song's ingredients join without creating a mess. Suckers are rarely as sloppy as they seem. \"Black Sheep\" leans as heavily on Modest Mouse as the band has previously, its chorus probably screamed into pickups just like Isaac Brock. While \"A Mind I Knew\" morphs from organ grinder into tribal weird out, \"2 Eyes 2 C\" sounds like AutoTuned choir practice and \"Roman Candles\" gets by on whistling plus pinwheeling falsetto. There's a lot going on. And what could have crippled Wild Smile unifies it instead, each influence made their own because they dab it with color and whimsy that's distinctly their own.Quinn Walker and Austin Fisher's voices can grate a little, both ringers at times for two of the more difficult frontmen of the past few years: Alec Ounsworth and Wild Beasts' Hayden Thorpe. But what could come off as pretense seems silly instead. As they take turns on highlight \"Martha\", they do it with heart you can hear. When they combine to cry Martha's name, horns bleating behind them, they sound free. That you can hear everywhere on Wild Smile and predictably, it's how they choose to close shop: \"Loose Change\" features lullaby piano, \"Seinfeld\" slap bass, a Talking Heads riff, and a crowd of wellwishers to carry the last coda home. Everyone's singing and everyone's clapping and everyone sounds to be having the best time. "}
