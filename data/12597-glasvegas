{"label":" Columbia","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/13108/homepage_large.5c091f83.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Scott Plagenhoef","artist":"Glasvegas","title":"Glasvegas","text":" Last year, the NME placed Vampire Weekend on its cover and declared that we were living in a time of renewed greatness in American music. Not long after, a blogger at The Guardian made essentially the same claim. Weirdly, the conventional wisdom for those of us on this side of the Atlantic was just the opposite, the line being that 2008 was a relatively hohum time for American indie rock. My suggestion for UK indie: It's not us, it's you. In the past few years, it's too few art school bands, too few mavericks, and too few iconoclasts; it's far too many groups that amount to a haircut, a worn copy of Is This It?, and a provincial accent. Above all, it's far too many bands that confuse ambition with chart placements instead of creativity.When Glasvegas first appeared a few years ago, they were trumpeted as an antidote to those problems and to bands like the Pigeon Detectives, the Enemy, and the View (don't worry you're not missing anything). They were a new template and a new set of influences (girlgroup, JAMC and most any other band Alan McGee signed in the 1980s, Suicide, rockabilly). In short, a new hope. Their 2007 \"Daddy's Gone\" / \"Flowers & Football Tops\" single quite rightly got plenty of people excited: Guitar pop with balanced levels of breadth and depth, hooks to spare, singer James Allan's thick Scottish brogue, and even lyrics that are \"about something\" (absent father and early death, respectively). Cue fanfare. And then, like so many other postOasis bands, Glasvegas somehow became swept into UK guitarrock's \"go big or go home\" mentality; they hooked up with Muse and Mars Volta producer Rich Costey and have turned out an album that's more Kasabian than vintage Creation.\"Flowers\" and \"Daddy's\" survived: The former kicks off the record and is still the band's best song to date, although now it takes almost 90 seconds to get going before it inexplicably closes with 90 seconds of \"You Are My Sunshine\". The bloat can't touch the awfully great four minutes in between but it's a worrying metaphor for the rest of the album: Perhaps the band was unsatisfied with or unconfident in what it had, perhaps it is equating scopes and importance with droney addons or non sequiturs but \"Flowers\" served as a glorious epitaph on its own without the grabs at additional heft.Another early song, former rockabillynicking \"I'm Gonna Get Stabbed\", has been renamed \"Stabbed\" and is now dominated by the melody to Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\". Most likely a reference to the ShangriLas' awesome and heartwrenching sexual abuse story \"Past, Present, and Future\", the addition of the classical piece here is awkward and cringeworthy.And the record sort of goes on like that: It's a frustrating listen, with almost every track containing both a hint of something awesome alongside a clunky distraction. (To be fair, fans of brash arena rock will likely overlook the missteps and find a lot to love here.) \"Daddy's Gone\" survives mostly intact, a tantalizing reminder that the prerelease huzzahs heaped upon Glasvegas were not just wellintended but wellfounded. Shouldbe single \"Polmont on My Mind\" and welcome musical switchup \"Ice Cream Van\" are worthy additions to the band's catalog. Newer singles \"Geraldine\" and \"It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry\" come close to matching \"Daddy's\", but are again weighed down by their own ambitions and clumsy lyrics particularly the latter which actually includes the lines \"liar, liar, pants on fire.\" No, really: That's the future of UK guitar rock.Here in America, we spent a lot of 2008, and now early 2009, celebrating a noisepop underground that, in places, takes weak pop songs and slathers them with fuzz and reverb under the pretense of art. In this environment, it's great to see a band like Glasvegas go for it, take their own noisepop impulses and shoot for the rafters. And yet, not only do they do it on almost every song, in almost the exact same way, but they seem to do just the opposite of the American brethren start with the fuzz and reverb, with quality noisepop, then tack on layer after layer of gloss until their songs are transformed into modern rock. In their rush to be the UK's most important band, they seem to have ignored restraint, charisma, and charm the qualities that made them Next Big Thing candidates in the first place. "}
