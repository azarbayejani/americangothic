Outside of Soulja Boy, it hasn't invented a new way to create a bonafide hiphop sensation though the precocious, 21year old Charles Hamilton is among a clutch of rappers (Wale, Bishop Lamont, Kid Cudi also among them) who've parlayed their buzz into label deals, but each has found themselves in a hinterland of the most vague release strategies possible. Tellingly, it's Asher Roth's careerstoking and hopefully careerending \"I Love College\" that stands as pretty much the only song the tangible world has heard from any of these guys.But if Charles Hamilton's Interscope debut (with rumored production from Pharrell) ever does drop,  The Best of the Hamiltonization Process  suggests that, well, it's hard to say. \"Future of rap\" accolades aside, he's more like the present Lil Wayne's prolificacy meets Kanye West's extroverted selfconsciousness (\"Please don't call me a hipster/ I'm from the heart not from the hip\") meets Lupe Fiasco's  Complexjocking fashion sense.The Best  is about as oldfashioned, hit pause/record as mixtapes get these days, and as a collection, you get to hear Hamilton learn on the job. He's surprisingly laconic for someone whose work ethic is his calling card, butÂ the results are likely to resonate with anyone who's felt the urge to write on a daily basis at points, Hamilton is particularly inspired, more often than not when alluding to his past drug abuse or familial dischord. He doesn't get particularly specific, often coming at his subjects from asides, but \"Waterworks\" and \"Mr. Perfect\" (featuring a surprisingly effective disembody of Hoobastank's \"The Reason\") are all the more affecting for steering clear of overly maudlin closet clearing.Other times, it's just production for production's sake, as with the terribly annoying (however heartfelt) porno love letter \"Lacey Duvalle\" and the single \"Brooklyn Girls\", which saddles his potential hit with the same grating \"Good Life\" flow throughout. But as chameleonic as he proves to be on the mic, he's still got a ways to go in terms of picking beats that don't overpower his rhymes and with writing hooks, i.e., the things that help listeners get through 22track tapes. If you're wondering why a selfcontained entity like Hamilton is looking to work with a dude like Skateboard P, consider how the stickiest chorus turns up on \"Windows Media Player\", where Hamilton lists his various webbased hustles like Mike Jones gone popup ad. And the last thing we need are rappers who think dropping Matrix raps are automatically deep and rappers who think dropping video game references are automatically clever, but on the trebly, overbearing \"Happy Ending\", Hamilton asks you either call him \"Neo\" or \"Neo Geo\" for no real good reason.It's tough to say exactly what you're evaluating here:  The Best  is somewhat defined as much by what it isn't (Hamilton's proper debut) by what it is (a somewhat haphazard sampling from nearly a dozen mixtapes and hundreds of tracks). Fair or unfair, it can be compared to Wale's fantastic  Mixtape About Nothing unfair because the latter was a mixtape in name only (featuring hifi production, a legitimate concept, guest stars), while the former is intentionally a patchwork. But ultimately, the bigger problem revolves around a lack of scope typical of people who spend most of their days on rap message boards for now,  The Best  stands up better as a primer on a formative talent than an exhibit of it.
