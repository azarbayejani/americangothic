Now don't turn around something's coming up behind you. It's coming closer and closer and closer...\" No, it's not John Ashcroft and his Legion of Lawless Thugs, though he might have a question or two for you if you're of middleEastern descent. The above sample begins Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves. Warped distortion sounds accelerate, and a disembodied voice croaks, \"Not wanting to be found.\" This short intro segues to the brutal rage of \"Cement Is Blue.\" It sounds like hardcore punk thrust through an oscillating fan, what with the constant clang of the drums and the noxious guitar. \"My hands are tied together,\" frontman Russell White screams over and over, and while the repetition gets too barbaric, the tense guitars and humming synth build up and then betray with a short ending. Michelle Maskovich and Russell White formed Champagne Kiss (with Jesse Johnson) after moving to Minneapolis. The duo's new band carries on like a continuation of their time in San Diego's Camera Obscura, a band that left only one document, To Change the Shape of an Envelope, which was rooted in the San Diego hardcore scene, yet branched out towards broader influences. Like fellow Diegodwellers Clikatat Ikatowi Camera Obscura were willing to experiment, jamming keyboards, samples and piano into the mix. Their songs were more polished than their kin, and they coupled White's shouts with Maskovich's understated backing vocals. A step in the direction of rock seemed likely. If anything, Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves is even more abrasive. I'm staring at the strange retro fashions on the cover all neon lines and angular skyscrapers and listening to the MIDI beeps and looped crying sounds at the beginning of \"Stereo Relapse.\" But then the track busts with a thick seam of guitar buzz and White screams about \"plastic consumption\" and \"reflective addictions.\" The Roland keyboard bleeps raw melodies, oddly appropriate for the seething emotions; the electronics are leveled so earsplittingly in the mix that you barely notice at first that the drums are all programmed. The aesthetic develops into an industrial process, combining remnants of newwave primitivism with postpunk's linear minimalism, and suddenly I'm feeling Reaganite paranoia all over again. \"Monarch Syndicate\" pummels with endless crashes of percussion as the guitars mass together and uncoil in screwloose chaos. Hardcore was a uniquely American reaction to punk and cold war suburbia in the 1980s defiance channeled through raw sonic force, a sense of community and brotherhood. Champagne Kiss offer up just a hint of that affirmation during the chorus of \"Black Violin\" as they raise their voices and guitars en masse, voices echoing each other awkwardly and shouting, \"This is the last time!\" But then White descends into emo diary drama, squealing about \"bleeding diamonds/ Hands are screaming/ Voice confessions/ That are bleeding.\" There's this breathy voiceover (\"Can you hear?\") that sounds like Rozz Williams fucking around on a Christian Death bside. The problem isn't just the loss of any sense of hope; it's that the alternative nihilism doesn't sound as scary as they want it to. \"80's Centric\" is the sound of a band lashing out at all that disgusts it but tripping over itself. \"Don't need another hex on my head!\" White yells, and the battered drums and shrill synth crescendos sound more campy than creepy. According to the liner notes, Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves was recorded in thirtyeight hours. I wish they'd taken more time. Their tech obsolescence and brittle robotic rhythm is in turns menacing and appealing, but this album doesn't contain any one song as amazing as Camera Obscura's \"Cinematheque,\" a surging wave of noise counterpointed by Maskovich's faint couplets. \"Deconstructing Genius\" comes the closest, defining the phrase \"synth stab\" while the guitar tingles edgily and White whispers, \"Panicstricken with your filled prescriptions.\" Screamed lyrics are buried far back, muted and metallic, coming out of some valiumlike haze, and after a few minutes of silence another section begins full of hyperspeed snares and lonely piano. The guitars play with knifeedge funk, and the band throws in voice samples about a research paper on the pharmacological properties of Soma. Half an hour is too short to tease with this kind of acidic commentary, but at least the place they're coming from makes sense these days. Remember all the Americans, shocked at terrorist attacks during a time of \"peace?\" "}
