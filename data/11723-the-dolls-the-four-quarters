{"label":" Huume","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/2536/homepage_large.838501b9.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nick Sylvester","artist":"The Dolls","title":"The Dolls","text":" If print's big guns weren't so hung up on being young or unlosing edge, this Dolls album could have been the rec to rec as far as oldfilthyrichpeoplepop is concerned for your longterm Goldmans and Sachs who don't have the patience or pedigree for actual classical music but want the look and bragabout difficulty and sophisto minks. There's a fucking piano on this album, just saying.In fairness Delay's on the powerbook so we're talking slick beyond slick here, which helps the Dolls' smooth jazz schlock go down easier than (for example) a bag of snakes. Never has Delay's Finnishness been his only selling point, as coffeeshop assholes round the world will surely feel the record's cold blistery tundrascopic soundscapthropic vibeism thingie thang, and most will enjoy sharing that revelation with the rest of us. To be honest though I can only take so much of the scattershot drums + fractured melodies=rhythmic complexity party before I start feeling the cold too chills, pneumonia. To say nothing of AGF's spoken word riffs and humorless insights re pop stars (she actually says \"pop stars\") and the \"New York City lights\" (which she rhymes with \"New York City life\") these count among the inanities here, which are countless.As for Delay's fourtrack fulllength, it's 65 straight minutes of iceblue longtones and stainless steel clinks, but it definitely clears the air when you need it to. Infinite to no fault, the quarters see Delay blowing out his typically nervous drum programming till the track movements are glacial, but never letting too many moments go by without some sort of surprise to prick us awake. Closer to Mutilia and Anima at the beginning, by the end Delay has given up on the rigor and settles just below Uusitalo dub. \"The Third Quarter\" sports vaguely hiphop beats and handclaps on the ups, then \"The Four Quarter\" finally gives way to the LP's only hot dance passage, though nobody's supposed to dancedance to it. Surely though there's a place for this stuff and a time, if you have the place. "}
