But the best ideas often come from people with an outsider's idea of and, better yet, a flippant disregard for scene and genre rules. And if these outsiders wind up connecting a few new dots even if by some na√Øve, happy accident well, that's how stasis gets disrupted, ain't it?Not that James Ford and Jas Shaw are clueless interlopers or anything. It's just that going back and listening to preMobile Discoera Simian albums like Chemistry Is What We Are and We Are Your Friends in dance terms, vaguely Madchester at best makes a mix like their installation in the FabricLive series, even in the wake of their acidsavvy Attack Decay Sustain Release, sound like the end result of one hell of a metamorphosis. But FabricLive 41 doesn't reveal much in the way of curriculum few tracks betray anything that might have informed Ford and Shaw in their transition into nurave vanguards, and it's mostly frontloaded with recent and soontobe favorites from the past year or two.Which makes it, at worst, a likeable contemporary dance mix with flashes of leftfield brilliance. Their tweak of Tomita's 1976 Stravinskygonedigital interpretation of the Firebird Suite selection \"Infernal Dance of King Kastchei\" is a sly intro, and slipping in Metro Area's 2001 classic deep electrohouse \"Miura\" amidst a block of more recent material proves a nice bit of context without jolting listeners out of the block of current hotness they'd spent the previous twentyplus minutes building up. For the most part, however, the mix stays firmly in 200708 turf, and as a symposium on modern house and techno it sounds remarkably cohesive in its diversity. It helps that it's mixed superbly and seamlessly, even as it jumps from the massive rave anthem Serge Santiago mix of Hercules & Love Affair's \"Blind\" into a glib, arcadebound acidhouse twofer from Smith N Hack (\"Space Warrior\") and Discodeine (\"Joystick\") or fuses Moon Dog's minimalist marimba/glockenspiel composition \"Suite Equestria\" with Fine Cut Bodies' maximalist house track \"Huncut Hacuka\".While it passes the test of a versatile, wellassembled mix sounding smoothflowing as a whole, but varied enough to sound weirdly choppy and jarring if you skip to each successive track after a minute FabricLive 41 also has the benefit of boasting two major peaks, one early, one late. The aforementioned \"Blind\" bleeds its way into the outro of new SMD cut \"Simple\" (a sharp bit of retropoplock Detroitness), then burbles and crests over seven and a half minutes of epic slow build that firmly anchors down the mix's momentum four tracks in. It's bookended sharply by a manic segue between two mid90s classics, Plastikman's military drumroll armflailer \"Spastik\" and the insistent panicattack thump of Green Velvet's \"Flash\", and the ensuing rattling stampede makes it the ideal climax to a mix that largely builds itself on a indiefriendly revival of predecessors like these. This peak is then awkwardly followed up by the actual setcloser, the Walker Brothers' vaguely Roxy Musicesque 1978 disco bid \"Nite Flights\", which drags that jittery intensity out into the middle of the street and runs it over with a car (albeit a really sleeklooking Lotus Esprit) but that's the risk you take with the nurave vanguard, and FabricLive 41's rewardtorisk ratio is high enough to recommend it easily.
