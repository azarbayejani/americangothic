{"label":" DFA","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/16703/homepage_large.87dd6c3b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"YACHT","title":"Shangri-La","text":" YACHT's second album as a duo, their fifth overall, fuses a utopian concept with the brand of nervy, spastic electrofunk we've come to expect from the DFA label. As on 2009's See Mystery Lights, Portland laptop maestro Jona Bechtolt (formerly of the Blow) and singer Claire L. Evans enjoy their smoothest sailing when they fully submit to sweaty euphoria; ShangriLa offers more than enough frantic beats, fidgety bass lines, spiky guitar leads, soaring piano riffs, delirious vocal harmonies, and, yes, cowbells to fit in on any houseparty playlist. Still, its idyllic theme can be a bit heavyhanded, and nothing here is quite as indelibly hooky as past single \"Psychic City (Voodoo City)\". ShangriLa continues YACHT's trajectory from blips and bloops that suggest their computerized origins to a fullfledged band sound that should translate nicely to hedonistic live shows. But the duo's sense of, well, fun hasn't gone anywhere. See Mystery Lights' nods to TPain and Desmond Dekker gives way to an endtimes synth workout \"Dystopia (The Earth Is on Fire)\", which shares a sevenminute video with the tropicalflavored discopunk of album opener \"Utopia\". When the pace slows, as on the spacey \"Love in the Dark\", instant quotables jump out: \"I love you like a smalltown cop/ Yeah, I wanna smash your face in with a rock,\" Evans sings, in deadpan multitrack. Still, the record tends to burden its good times with a few too many ideas that simply aren't that distinctive. Brassboosted \"Holy Roller\", which starts as a fingersnapping cousin to Black Lips' religionminded \"Veni Vidi Vici\" and ends closer to the doomed stomp of Modest Mouse's \"Fly Trapped in a Jar\" (by way of dubstep basswobble), recommends not worrying about a god. James Murphyesque dancerant \"Paradise Engineering\" finds holiness within. The basic gist and despite its familiarity, it's a commendable one is that, as Belinda Carlisle once sang, heaven is a place on Earth. \"If we build a utopia, will you come and stay?\" asks ShangriLa's closing, title track, all catchy lalalas and beatific afterglow. Paradise, the song suggests, can be California, Oregon, Texas, or anywhere we choose: an appealing and valuable notion. But it's worth remembering that when newwave forebears Blondie found \"Rapture\", it was \"toe to toe/ Dancing very close.\" "}
