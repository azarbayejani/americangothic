In that case, Montreal dancerock trio We Are Wolves must've been off programming their synthesizers when they handed out romantic expertise, because for these Quebecois, courtship is anything but smooth and debonair. Testosterone helps make the male a lover, but it just as easily brings out the fighter, and WAW's postapocalyptic dance tunes reflect this threecar pileup between lust, rage, and romance. Don't bother asking these guys who they'd fuck, marry, or killthe answer's always the same for each category. The band's solid debut, charmingly titled Nonstop Je Te Plie en Deux (\"NonStop I Fold You in Two\" in English) carved its own niche within dancerock's overcrowded market by heavily emphasizing the dirty and painful. Listening to the tweeterfrying synth lines and diesel engine beats, you'd sooner drop Tylenol Migraine than ecstasy if caught on the dancefloor. Though psychologically residual, WAW's sterile spin on dance music still lacked dimension stylistically, and Total Magique looks to transmogrify this onetrick pony. The band sticks to their guns. Just as NonStop's \"Little Birds\" more or less disemboweled \"My Sharona\", new track \"Magique\" mangles a \"Blue Monday\" bassline, with singer Alex Ortiz howling about the virtues of magic in French. Pounding opener \"Fight & Kiss\" establishes the album's ongoing relationship rollercoaster, capped by a lascivious Ortiz plea: \"Wasted all these years/ Wasted all these tears/ Come and kiss me.\" Ortiz maintains his stubborn stance along with the band's stubborn krautinfused dance on belligerent numbers like \"Some Words\" and \"Walk Away Walk\", but eventually they flash a bit of a soft side.  In their own twisted way, WAW compose some alluring ballads here, patching together leftover scraps of noise to supplement their bizarre courtships. On \"Coconut Night\", a seldomused guitar provides cocksure, almost AC/DClike backing as Ortiz fumbles over lines about snakes and seas until a Cyrano whispers in his ear and he goes cornball: \"You are my coconut night/ My favorite place.\" The nature theme continues on \"So Nice, So Cold\", a delicate electro paean to snow that ends with the nearHallmark line \"I wish I could walk to the pyramids with you.\"  With these modifications, Total Magique proves a richer offering than WAW's debut, yet as the final three mostly instrumental tracks reveal, they still leave something to be desired texturally. Stripped of a pulsing rhythm or anguished vocal, these songs struggle to produce a worthwhile hook, and the trio's distaste for standard dance builds causes the tracks to flatline. Then again, WAW have never failed to deliver on their bread and butter, and asking for much more feels somewhat greedy. You want sleek, unperverted dance music, go to a disco. These guys only pump out the vilest of the male condition, and Total Magique is an emotional train wreck that's hard to pull away from.  "}
