{"label":" Merge","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/15108/homepage_large.c3ba0488.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Klein","artist":"Radar Brothers","title":"The Illustrated Garden","text":" After several solid albums many of them released by Merge and almost 15 years of effort, the bulk of Los Angeles' Radar Bros. have jumped ship. Among the notables left behind is singer, multiinstrumentalist, and producer Jim Putnam, who arguably has always been the band's central figure.Â Ironically, getting whittled down to one primary member probably makes it easier to stretch out the lifespan of a band, and Putnam soon rechristened the group Radar Brothers and recruited a new rhythm section (bass player Be Hussey and drummer Stevie Treichel) to record The Illustrated Garden. Just as the band's name is only slightly different, the new lineup's sound is only slightly different as well, yet the impact of the changes is still felt. It could be just be a trick of the light, but Putnam's songs here seem a little less elliptical than usual, the music more focused in its gauzy exploration of what could be loosely called Americana.The \"Americana\" tag sticks thanks to the general countryrock tropes and all the natural imagery, but as usual the group excels at blurring the edges of an already blurry genre with spacey (but never indulgent) psych leanings, controls set for the heart of the sun but anchored comfortably down to earth. Songs such as \"Quarry\", \"Radio\", and \"For the Birds\" recall such fellow travelers as the Meat Puppets at their most desertfried, but Putnam's gentle vocals and the generally blissedout disposition of the new lineup highlight the band's allegiance to craft over sunbathed affectation.Indeed, when all else fails, The Illustrated Garden sure sounds great, with \"Horses Warriors\", \"And the Birds\", \"Xmas Lights\", and \"People\" all echoing the settled, mellow spirit of the early 1970s. Each track glows like a golden hour snapshot capturing a certain sunset idealism (occasional flashes of menace in the lyrics aside), and if Putnam surely harbors no illusions at this point of his music's reach, that doesn't mean his songs shine any less brightly.
