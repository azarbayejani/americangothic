If you're in a club and you're dancing and the DJ drops a repetitive track in the middle of the set to maintain the momentum, should you bother worrying about whether or not there's a good hook in the melody and focus on how empty the composition seems to be, or do you just keep moving and accept that the groove is what matters and there's some other song that could fill that compositional dynamic later in the set? It's a conflict that's been separating straightup clubbound music from the eclectic popcrossover potential of groups like Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx for a long time now (to say nothing of, oh, DeeeLite), and the tendency to play both sides is what made Felix Da Housecat's output earlier this decade both wellbalanced and perilously close to falling on the wrong side of the equation whatever the wrong side would be. If Virgo Blaktro and the Movie Disco says anything which, frustratingly enough, it really doesn't the message is that you can fall on the wrong side of pop and club simultaneously. Virgo Blaktro is, at least presumably, a record centered around a revival of the more melodic, songcrafting aspect of dance music, with a focus on black artistry present in the late 1970s and early 80s; Felix claimed in the Nettwerk PR material that he wanted to aim for Prince and PFunk, with touches of whatiftheywereblack versions of George Michael and the Pet Shop Boys. It's an interesting M.O. that could've touched on some of club music's most persistent and intriguing crosspollinations, especially given the nowfamiliar collision between American funk and European Italo/synthpop. Plus, it'd be a breath of fresh air to hear him working without the weight of his last two albums' \"electroclash\" trendiness informing his style. But when he examines the way these sounds play off each other, he does so superficially, and potentially interesting firstdraft sketches are passed off as end products. At the risk of dropping this album into the old \"this food tastes awful...and such small portions\" joke, the songs at the core of Virgo Blaktro suffer from being both repetitive and short, lacking both the versechorusverse structure that makes 3minute pop songs work and the gradual crests and transmutations that underpin the best 10minute underground house cuts. Of the sixteen tracks, only two are longer than three and a half minutes, with an eighttrack songandskit stretch in the middle where nothing goes further than 2:22. That stretch might have worked as a sort of midalbum minisuite, but despite the tracks' general sonic consistency the delicatelyautotuned \"It's Been a Long Time\", the icy minimalism of \"Monkey Cage\" (with a lyrical lift from Prince's \"America\") and the subtly euphoric \"I Seem 2B the 1\" all have a sleek, similarlypaced electrofunk energy to them it doesn't particularly cohere into a specific mood, transitioning from wistful to stressed to lovestruck without any thematic thread and leaving listeners with a scattershot grouping of songs that should've been given more time to transcend their fleeting, allhook superficiality. There's probably worse crimes than writing tracks that just stop where other artists (or a younger Felix) would've really gotten warmed up, but the lost potential of songs like the outlandish twopart carnival funk/replicant soul diptych of \"I Saw the Future/Blaktroman\" and \"Mad Sista\" combined, a mere 69 seconds is perplexing. Still, there's a small handful of cuts in the threeminuteplus range that feel complete enough, and while the two attempted \"epic\" tracks near the end belie the album's skeletal notion of electrosoul \"Tweak\" sounds like the worstcase scenario results of Justice dismantling Amii Stewart's \"Knock on Wood\", and \"The Future Calls the Dawn\" turns his 1993 single \"Thee Dawn\" into grating pseudotrance there's a few good nuggets here and there. \"Night Tripperz\" might be a flatout knockoff of Moroder's American Gigolo composition \"Night Drive\", but it's also a lot prettier, trading Moroder's upfront bombast for warmer, more subdued synths and a hauntingly repeated vocal hook of \"night trippers, take me home.\" \"Radio\" drains all the twee from the Buggles' solitary hit and replaces it with a multilayered melodic vocal that switches between claustrophobiainducing and calmly detached. And it's easy to forgive \"Like Something 4 Porno!\" its lighter transgressions (#1: the title; #2: the clich√© \"sexy\" lyrics that title necessitates) just for being the big moment on the record where the funk completely takes over in the service of a genuinely catchy and welldeveloped dancefloor filler. A damn shame so much of the record's remainder feels like filler of a different kind. "}
