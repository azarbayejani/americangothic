However, it's rare that these solo sojourns wind up eclipsing the work of the mothership act, and even rarer when they reveal the singerdude's fondness for lipstick and eyeliner, facility with choreographed dance routines, and eagerness to call his sexuality into question. For those who aren't familiar with John O'Regan's workmanlike postpunk outfit the D'Urbervilles and, lamentably, few people outside the TorontoMontreal indierock corridor are the magnitude of his transformation into lofi glitter god Diamond Rings can be quantified as such: imagine Britt Daniel decided one day that he really wanted to be Lady Gaga.Alas, the Diamond Rings story has decidedly unglamorous origins the concept was born in a Toronto hospital bed, where O'Regan spent summer 2008 battling a sudden, severe onset of Crohn's disease, using the recovery time to write new songs on guitar and keyboards. Many people who've endured invasive medical procedures often feel the desire to reclaim control of their bodies by marking them with tattoos or piercings; it's thus instructive to view O'Regan's metamorphosis from indierock everyman into the flamboyant Diamond Rings not as some premeditated, shockvalue provocation, but as a process of trading in his scarred, sickly body for a more physically pristine one.The heavily YouTubed 2009 single \"All Yr Songs\" was Diamond Rings' proverbial comingout party, showcasing O'Regan's newly mascaraed visage and a sweet boombox serenade several degrees warmer and more affectionate than the D'Urbervilles' spiky new wave. But on his longgestating fulllength debut, Special Affections, O'Regan is less interested in blurring gender lines as toying with extreme contrasts of masculinity and femininity, pitting his authoritative baritone, aggressive electricguitar strums, and bald, cutting sentiments against silken slowjam arrangements, radiant synth lines, and twinkling tinkertoy beats.Pretty much every line on Special Affections can be read as O'Regan's coming to terms with his new persona whether he's \"covering [his] conscience with a new disguise\" on the austere, pianolaced opener \"Play by Heart\", or declaring his intent to \"write my own story, make it all up as I go\" on the crunk&B crunch of \"You Oughta Know\". But unlike other artists who've crafted albumlength narratives around a new guise from Bowie to Beyonc√© Diamond Rings is a vehicle through which O'Regan can more candidly address the sensitive matters in his own personal life, effectively equating the awkward feeling of wearing makeup in public for the first time to other intimately discomfiting scenarios, be it the painful realization that a relationship is over (\"PreOwned Heart\") or the fear of acting on suppressed lust (\"Give It Up\"). When O'Regan sings, \"I'm feeling like a bitpart actor\" on the clicktracked fuzzpop of \"Wait & See\", you can tell he's got matters on his mind far weightier than how his rainbow facepaint looks.But as fascinating as it is to hear an indie rock artist step outside of his comfort zone, both musically and emotionally, Special Affections' skeletal electropop sketches routinely fortify into fullblooded anthemic choruses that make O'Regan's liberation your own. (The fact that O'Regan never lets on whether he's singing to a boy or a girl further emphasizes its universal applications.) In rock music, the traditional litmus test of a song's strength is whether it holds up to an acousticguitar reading; with Special Affections, O'Regan who claims he's still committed to keeping the D'Urbervilles a going concern simply applies the same logic to his GarageBand presets. And on an album full of sturdy singalongs, none stands taller than \"Something Else\", a scrappy powerpop triumph that plays like a more natural, better executed version of the synthedup Strokes experiment that Julian Casablancas attempted on Phrazes for the Young.Not one to forget who brought him to the dance, O'Regan drops \"All Yr Songs\" into the finalsong slot. But after the preceding nine tracks documenting difficult breakups and tawdry hookups, the gesture feels less like a case of saving the hit for last and more of a timecapsule farewell to Diamond Rings' more innocent origins. And since early versions of Special Affections started circulating as far back as last March, O'Regan has pomped up even further with the bigroom Eurohouse flourishes and Britneyized bump'n'grind of recent, nonalbum single \"Show Me Your Stuff\". But even if Diamond Rings' rapidly evolving aesthetic has already moved beyond Special Affections' bedsit R&B, the album still stands as an exemplary model of how one can live out blingedout fantasies on a cubic zirconia budget.
