{"label":" EMI / DFA","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/2017/homepage_large.1233b5b1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nick Sylvester","artist":"Various Artists","title":"DFA Records Holiday Mix 2005","text":" For the sensible types who don't fuck with remixes, the DFA's Holiday Mix 2005 collects, sequences, and beatmatches the better ones that the New Yorkbased label commissioned for three of its primary artists: savantnoise trio the Black Dice, drizzly electrofunker the Juan Maclean, and dancerock flagship act LCD Soundsystem. Later in the mix a krauty soundscape off Black Dice's Broken Ear Record called \"ABA\" and a gorgeous unreleased Delia & Gavin flutter ballad called \"#5\" rep as breather tracks for inhouse mixers Tim Goldsworthy and Tim Sweeney, who turn in another typically smooth, effortless blend. People think DJing is easy because of these guys. After that, we could talk about how four otherwise completely different artists sound at peace with one another on this mix about the phantom strand of gattaca that keeps them related (though DNA themselves may not be far off here) . But really, Holiday Mix 2005 has less to do with the DFA, more with one small trend this year in dance music: strungout, spacefeeling discohouse and discohouse remixes, the patient, sometimes aimless explorations that dominated 2005's 10 p.m.12 a.m. stretch. The kickoff means much: Goldsworthy and Luomo each stretch out Black Dice's impossibly compact \"Smiling Off\" like silly putty, the former with harder rockdrum sounds, the latter with trademark slick swaps and swoops. A testament to its density, Juan's \"Give Me Every Little Thing\" appears here in four different incarnations, dubbed and drugged, clubbed and club'd. And in the case of LCD's \"Too Much Love\", remixers Rub 'N' Tug just let the discohouse track lose itself, here granting infinite space to the original's unsettling, claustrophobic vocal harmonies. Stretch everything out like that, though, and the mix pretty much refuses momentum. The 48minute run moves steady but stays still, if that makes sense. Only at the last seconds do Tim and Tim move into harder stuff: first Tiga and Jesper Dahlback's remix of \"Tribulations\", and finally into Soulwax's acidic take on \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\". That's when the party starts, really which makes Holiday something of a perfect, propitious calm. "}
