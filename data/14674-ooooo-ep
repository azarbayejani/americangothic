Under the moniker oOoOO (pronounced \"oh\"), he's releasing his selftitled debut EP on Tri Angle a label that has come to be associated with the trendy sound through releases from likeminded acts such as Balam Acab. And though certain hallmarks of the genre's syrupy electrogoth can be detected on oOoOO, from the traphop drum machines to the frosted synths, he seems determined not to be pigeonholed, all while remaining one of the frontrunners of the scene.Simply put, the guy isn't easy to peg. His earlier material explored spatial Dirty South trademarks (\"NoSummr4u\") alongside a lanternlit sea chanty (\"No Shore\"). But the synthesis of these seemingly opposite styles along with Greenspan's ability to make them work in a purely electronic setting and feel comfortable up against one another has lead to this solid debut. Opener \"Mumbai\" is a brief, dystopian dirge that mixes a chopped Hindipop vocal with droning Middle Eastern atmospherics and hollow claps. It's not an unexpected introduction it's spooky, witchy but it's born from a variety of approaches.Surprisingly, it's also approachable. Thus while making music that practically prides itself on being druggy and otherwordly, Greenspan is able to rise above his peers. Highlight \"Hearts\" drops a pin at the crossroads where commercially viable hiphop gravitates toward leftfield electronic influences. Talking to Pitchfork a few months ago, Greenspan discussed his admiration for popcentered hiphop and R&B artists like Nicki Minaj and Usher, and much of oOoOO (like the woozy club vibe of \"Burnout Eyess\" or the uncharacteristically sensual allure of \"Sedsumting\") manages to bridge these two worlds. Greenspan feels so comfortable in his own skin that, by following his own unique patterns, he's able to defy the confines of a genre that seems especially susceptible to bandwagonjumping. "}
