{"label":" P.W. Elverum & Sun","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/11311/homepage_large.05e7ff65.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jessica Suarez","artist":"Mount Eerie","title":"Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP","text":"  Pacific Northwest musician and artist Phil Elverum, aka Mount Eerie, writes around tactile sensations. In his better incarnation, Microphones, song titles such as \"The Pull\", \"I Felt Your Shape\", \"Ice\", and \"Sand (Eric's Trip)\" conjure elements of motion and texture. Those were songs with seasick dynamics: booms and flicks; hard, lumbering drums; and Elverum's soft voice. Willful amateurism is the other defining characteristic of Elverum's career, in ways both admirable (the care and dedication he shows in packaging and releasing his own material) and silly (this EP comes with a bootleg of the track list, played live, and captured by a tape recorder held up to a PA). Sometimes that amateurism has given off the distinct impression that Elverum's not trying very hard, but he's had plenty of bright spots, too. This release is one of them.Black Wooden Ceiling Opening is the first of Elverum's experiments in \"black metal using natural materials.\" Despite his claims to genrehopping, this sixsong EP isn't so different from his other releases. For one thing, three of the tracks have seen light on other albums, though in different forms (something he also attempted in 2005 when he reworked songs on \"Singers\"). But even the new tracks fit his discography, though with mealier textures and darker tones. The album's best track is one of the older ones. \"Don't Smoke\" originally released on a limited 7\" makes good on its title: Elverum doesn't want you to smoke. Though his argument is sincere, his reasons are a bit flimsy: You smoke because \"there's a little part of you that wants to be dead\" or maybe because \"the rebellion against the adults hasn't ended yet.\" The guitar is more furious than his pleas, and it's the tension and crash of the music that make this the EP's standout.  \"Blue Light on the Floor\" is another makeover. The first version, from 2007's Mount Eerie Pts. 6 & 7, shimmers and flexes; cymbals and low organ drones ebb and flow behind his voice. The Black Wooden Ceiling Opening version eschews scenery for action and powerful exhales of gutrumbling distortion. There are some real, menacingly fast intakes of breath from Elverum, too, which reinforce the aggression. And the doubletracked vocals fit the song's muscular makeover more than they do the earlier version, which ends with the same gruff textures that you'll find on Black Wooden Ceiling Opening. Maybe Elverum had planned this version from the beginning.  Plain, literal, naked, on closer \"Stop Singing\" Elverum sings: \"If I stopped bellowing my voice in the void/ I would notice songs that all around me sing.\" Like a smoker, Elverum's compulsion to keep going trumps his own best interests when he recognizes that compulsion is when he's at his best, though his recent output hasn't topped his Microphones work. But Elverum's experiment is less about moving forward than mulling over. Restlessness or laziness, who knows. But as Mount Eerie, he can rework his material in a way that makes it meatier but still tactile, more aggressive yet as emotionally understated and gentle as his voice.  "}
