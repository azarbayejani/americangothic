{"label":" Polyvinyl","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/3981/homepage_large.446f0296.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Hail Social","title":"Hail Social","text":" \"Radio, radio,\" Dayve Hawk sings on \"Come Out Tonight\". Most of his lyrical efforts on Hail Social's debut are as vibrantly decorative as gold glitter, and just about as empty (no dis the Rakes half footshot their debut with poignant lyrics, and Hail Social comes off better being pretty vacant). But if you're into the pat unity that symbolism provides, you can read it like that: An oblique invocation of alienated distress and wayward transmissions to put a sinister twist on the invitation to \"Come out tonight/ There will be someone waiting.\" Really though, those six syllables are just a handy pivot between the crunchy guitars of the chorus and the blocky bass of the next verse. The unthinking man's Franz Ferdinand won't make you reexamine your heteronormative assumptions, but you might feel like going out. Then again, maybe there's more to it after breezing through the nine remarkably easytolistento tracks on this album, it's not hard to imagine that \"radio, radio\" is Hawk staking out his territory. Some of you will hate Hail Social on principle, catching a whiff of crass commoditization, and maybe you'll even lose respect for Interpol for \"putting them on.\" After all, this Philly band just burst out of nowhere and snagged a Spin \"Band of the Nanosecond\" clip for their press file, armed with LCD Soundsystem bass pulsation, staccato newnewwave guitars, Rick Ocaslick type production and Duran Duran arena stomp, an emo falsetto in a postpunk mask. All of these snap together to create the spiky, measured turbulence of opener \"Hands are Tied\". You know those gummachine toys, where you have to get a bunch of oddlyshaped pieces to fit together in a perfect sphere? Like that. \"I met her, and I walked away/ A mess of emotion,\" Hawk belts. Tough guy/ Sensitive guy total package, anyone? Yep, it's gonna be that kind of party. Another camp will dislike it on first blush, but find themselves helplessly won over in the long run (stop by my tent and say hello, we can rock out to Hail Social, Stellastarr*, and Longwave in likeminded company). And diehard popists will wish Hail Social had gone even further in distilling every fuckall trendy modern trope into one shining pop gloss. But everyone should agree that this debut is the model of efficiency: One singer, one guitar, bass, drums, and even these are deployed sparely. The bass favors rigid polygons, gliding on \"Repetition\", sparring with handclaps on \"Get in the Car\". The guitar metes out crisp, syncopated leads that waste no notes in outlining the melodies, and Hawk's voice soars effortlessly over the open spaces. RIYL singing along, amping up your toilette before a night out, fun.  "}
