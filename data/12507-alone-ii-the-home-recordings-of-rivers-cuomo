For Rivers Cuomo, there naturally was plenty of interest. Thankfully, Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo the followup to last year's Alone is nearly as good as the earlier volume: There's less deepvault revelation this time around but there's more variety in style and sound.Bad news first: Despite a flashy guitar solo and some laborious harmonies, \"I Want to Take You Home Tonight\" plods, and \"The Prettiest Girl in the Whole Wide World\" would have been better left in the garage. Alone had its silly spots, for sure, but they at least revealed a lot of Cuomo's personality and charm. There's not a lot of replay value in marchingband interludes and song snippets played into answering machines, and while covers are fun, the Beach Boys' \"Don't Worry Baby\" is a choice and an arrangement that will surprise no one, ably performed or not.The best Alone II offers is straightahead, nononsense powerpop not that anyone's ever complained about that from Cuomo. \"My Brain Is Working Overtime\" joyously rides a scant few chords into the ground, \"Walt Disney\" sparkles gently but confidently, and \"I'll Think About You\" is a staccato acoustic jig with Cuomo sounding, for once, relaxed. More pieces from \"lost album\" Songs From the Black Hole are revealed yet again with a fullblown song suite: Longing ballad \"Oh Jonas\" features some vocal schizophrenia, which segues into the lurching \"Please Remember\", and ends on the playful and slightlyseedy \"Come to My Pod\". All of them are goofy, offthecuff, and charming.Bleedingheart Weezer fans will still find at least a few tracks to pin their fond memories on. \"The Purification of Water\", a strident Blue Albumworthy ballad, pins familiar lowend riffery on some Hammondesque organ. \"I Don't Want You Let to Go\" has lovely acoustic instrumentation, and even the maudlin piano bitchout to critics, \"My Day Is Coming\", is believably wounded. Any of these would fit onto any of their records with a little more time and attention, but the instrumentation and fauxRomantic lyrics of \"The Purification of Water\" is the only one that distinguishes itself in this early form.The novelty acoustic rap cover might be the most odious trend of my generation, but previouslyunreleased track \"Can't Stop Partying\" subtly bucks the trend. A lack of irony doesn't make it less awkward, but it's certainly more palatable: it's a collaboration with Jermaine Dupri, for one, has an oddly striking melody (even if it's a little close to Smashing Pumpkins' \"Disarm\" for comfort), and made slightly more interesting in a sadlibertine sort of way for a mournful tone behind it's partyready lyrics.\"Can't Stop Partying\" doesn't sound awkward from Cuomo, necessarily but it does sound heavily labored. Cuomo isn't the type of artist to wait around for divine inspiration he's a worker, songwriting is his job but as we get deeper into the vaults, more of the material sounds like actual work, or daily exercises without a spark of fun or unpredictability (outside of a woebegotten spacethemed rock opera, of course). Alone was worth the occasional cringe to show Cuomo's experiments and sonic baby photos through the years, especially after three studiously formulaic records. The weird part is that, after the Red Album, Cuomo's day job is actually more unpredictable than these demos for better or for worse. "}
