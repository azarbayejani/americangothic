That's a damn shame, because as much as I enjoy the rockier efforts of Mr. McCaughan, this disc is one place where they aren't welcome. The trailer for this film features one such \"rocking\" track it's not officially on the soundtrack, but in this context, it sounds like the sort of middling indie rock you'd find on the middling soundtrack of a middling indie film. Jury's still out on whether Who Loves The Sun? qualifies as \"middling\" it's currently playing the festival thing in preparation for a fall release. But bland rock moves aside, this soundtrack is a nice surprise, exceeding expectations when it eschews the expected. \"Surprise\" is a relative term, of course. That McCaughan wrote most of this music for instruments he's not proficient in is besides the point. Anyone that's been following his moves over the past 10 years has become accustomed to his use of strings and other orchestral accoutrements, as well as his expanding compositional palette. Still, even the most dedicated fan might do a double take when they hear the guy that wrote \"Why Do You Have to Put a Date On Everything?\" turn to cello and a charmingly clumsy acoustic guitar for this disc's first track, \"Will's Return\". That doubletake will probably turn into a fullon gawk when they hear Mac unfurl a melodic theme that sounds as good essayed on piano (\"Once Nice Piano\") as it does on upright bass and flute (\"Nice One\") or acoustic guitar and oboe (\"Nice Strums\"). It's a pleasant tune containing a wry bittersweet wrinkle, which makes it perfect to reprise in a film about estranged friends and lovers reuniting. In fact, a bittersweet feeling permeates every inch of this soundtrack, from the title of the film (taken from a highpoint of the VU's Loaded album) to the song titles (\"The Sunset Rock\", \"Seems Like a Long Time Ago\") to the music itself. \"Snake Music\", a solo piano piece, possess a haunting echo that recalls the keytickling of another reformed Chapel Hill indie dude, Crooked Fingers' Eric Bachmann. Gorgeous downbeat tunes like \"Do You Want To Know?\" or the album's closing track \"Older Summer\", with their brushed drums and autumnsweater haze, reflect shades of Yo La Tengo's more nostalgic work. Even the halfminutelong \"Fighting Music\", played primarily on a toy xylophone in a peppy powerpop style, conveys that sense of reminiscence and nostalgia. McCaughan's so successful at establishing this mood that when those fewandfarbetween rock moments finally arrive (in the form of two \"Chase\" songs), they come off like farts during a wedding ceremony. It might have been the rock'n'roll that gives McCaughan the freedom to write movies soundtracks, but in this instance he's better off forgetting that he ever rocked.  "}
