That 1999 set is justifiably viewed as a watershed it brought the Magnetic Fields a much larger audience but it's also slightly overrated, unfairly eclipsing his smaller, darker, especially affecting earlier work. Outside 2004's underwhelming \"me\"centric i, Merritt isÂ  strongest when he has precise space limits and when he's applying his volumes of ideas to intimate, less showy canvases. Think of the 10 lonesome road songs populating 1994's excellent The Charm of the Highway Strip. Or, more than a decade later, Distortion's take on Jesus and Mary Chainstyle fuzz. His deep baritone was made for the stage, but it does something special when coming quietly through an old cassette player, a crackling turntable, or a pair of wellworn headphones. Plus, the frames aren't always necessary: Merritt's aesthetic is distinctive enough that songs that aren't connected with a conceptual thread still sound like chapters in a larger book or, better yet, a diary. See, for instance, Obscurities, the Mergeimprinted collection of odds, ends, side projects, and Bsides. It features material recorded prior to 69 Love Songs much of it Mergeassociated from 1991's Susan Anwaysung synthesized pastoral Distant Plastic Trees to 1995's Get Lost. The compilation is attributed to Merritt, not the Magnetic Fields it features work from a variety of monikers (the 6ths, Gothic Archies, Buffalo Rome), and he's the only constant. But the 14 tracks, pulled together from all corners, come together like a lost Magnetic Fields studio album from the early golden era, not an afterthefact miscellany. Longtime fans will likely be interested in Obscurities for the previously unreleased material. The set has three songs from the Song From Venus era, the unfinished scifi musical Merritt was writing with Lemony Snicket (\"Forever and a Day\", \"The Song From Venus\", and \"When You're Young and in Love\"), a lovely, dour unused 69 Love Songs outtake \"The Sun and the Sea and the Sky\", and the selfdescribed \"heavy metal\" curiosity \"Scream (Till You Make the Scene)\". But it's the old, partially forgotten favorites that give Obscurities its heart. It feels like tracks were selected based on tone and narrative arc, not availability they're sequenced by sound rather than year or affiliation. Because memory's imperfect, it's occasionally difficult to tell if you're hearing the original version or a different take, forcing you to pull out those old records and check. The way Obscurities is arranged, you only get two \"new\" songs in a row once, so these \"aha\" moments keep popping up, the first via the ambling, Cureinspired homemade new wave of \"Rats in the Garbage of the Western World\" the BSide to 1995's \"All the Umbrellas in London\" single. It's followed by the lush, busy 1998 7\" version of \"I Don't Believe You\", a driving track that's recast on i. You also get the quirky kitchen sink ballad \"When I'm Not Looking, You're Not There\" from that same single. Later its the rollicking \"BeachaBoopBoop\", a spry BSide from Harriet Records' 1993 \"Long Vermont Roads\" single. It's great to hear early Magnetic Fields vocalist Susan Anway emerge from the shadows. She leaves her mark on \"Take Ecstasy With Me\", the classic Merritt love song that closes 1994's Holiday. As far as other singers, we hear Shirley Simms doing an alternate, quieter, less countrified spin on Distant Plastic Trees' \"Plant White Roses\". Merritt sang a version on Merge's 1994 Rows of Teeth compilation, but this take is better. There's also Young Marble Giants' Stuart Moxham on \"Yet Another Girl\", the upbeat, but moody pop song from the 6ths Wasps' Nests. The 6ths are famously known as Merritt's rotatingvocalist project, but he handles things himself on \"Rot in the Sun\", the crooning Bside to 1993's \"Heaven in a Black Leather Jacket\". Obscurities ends with \"You Are Not My Mother and I Want to Go Home\", a song you'll also find on the audio book for Neil Gaiman's horror/fantasy novella Coraline. Merritt later wrote an OffBroadway musical for the youngadult book, but you're left with a crisper, sharper impression hearing this one swirling, 3minute bit of outerspace exploration. Obscurities itself is over in less than 40 minutes: It's understated, personal, insular, oddball, and often gorgeous, an unexpectedly coherent collection from an important band. "}
