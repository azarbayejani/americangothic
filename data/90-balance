It's a noble cause one that promotes KRS' ongoing devotion to \"edutainment\" and gets communities involved in the four elements and respect is due. However, I think they need some people working on the public imaging over there at the Temple of HipHop, 'cause this year, the theme is... \"responsibility!\" Now. While I'm all for behaving responsibly and not painting hiphop in a bad light by, like, bumping Outkast out my boombox while shoplifting or something, there hasn't been a wonkier, more awkward theme for a positive event since Back to the Future's \"Enchantment Under the Sea\" prom motto. Responsibility. Since when did I go back to kindergarten? Was this in the syllabus? And most importantly, I thought we were gonna be getting some \"tainment\" with our \"edu.\" Initially, I was feeling the same incredulity towards KRS collaborator Akrobatik's second record, which is titled, simply, Balance, and comes jampacked with laidback, conscious, messagedriven hiphop. But where I expected raps about yoga or the medicinal benefits of yerba mate tea, I got: \"Ring the sweat out ya pores when you done with these verbal calisthenics\" and \"When I kick intricate shit you get intimate witchya brain.\" Even when I thought Akrobatik (aka \"the black action figure with the kung fu grip\") might start to get preachy about his responsible way of life, he instead spat, \"I don't waste my time writin' ignorant rhymes, but I know that makin' niggas laugh ain't no crime.\" (Friends at Temple of HipHop, please take note.) The Boston lyricist's themes are all fairly simple \"Balance\" is about balance, \"Hypocrite\" is about hypocrisy, \"Time\" examines of the concept of time and reality and his storytellingrich style is smooth and easygoing. But, keeping with the theme, Akrobatik's raps are balanced with occasionally intense production by DJ Sense, DJ Therapy, Da Beatminerz, Edan, and DJ Fakts One (with whom Akrobatik and Mr. Lif have a crew, called The Perceptionists). The Edan and Fakts One cuts work best with Akrobatik's style, complimenting his relatively straightforward delivery with complex, isolated drumming which sometimes unravels simple breakbeats only to embellish them with surprising, fireworkclatter drum fills, confident bass buzz, and quirky funk. Later, Akrobatik himself takes a stab at funk in his selfproduced duet with Mr. Lif, \"Wreck Dem\" one of the record's best, despite that Lif's higherpitched, sharper delivery steals the show out from under Akrobatik's lower timbre. In short, Akro's style is of an older, simpler school perhaps the same one where \"responsibility\" could pass as a theme without needing a fancy spin to entice the cynics. "}
