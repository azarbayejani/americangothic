Vista","text":" I'm beginning to suspect Japan's Polysics belong to some sort of fair trade conspiracy to shill jittery new wave in the U.S. and UK, countries already swollen with Devo and Pere Ubu soundalikes. Back when the market would've been more receptive, the Polysics released Hey! Bob! My Friend and Neu, impressive works of cataclysmic spazrock that largely fell on deaf ears. Polysics or Die!!! and Now Is the Time!, released on Tofu in 2005 and 2006 respectively, hoped to firebomb American indie audiences until they approved, though the latter's watereddown synthpop suggested that the band's window of opportunity was quickly closing. Now MySpace Records has adopted these foundlings with good intentions, though the upstart label appears unable to learn from the past, as Polysics or Die!!! Vista marks... another Polysics compilation.Vista is basically a compilation of compilations, culling most of its material from the last three Polysics records and a few stray singles. Old standards like \"New Wave Jacket\" and \"Black Out Fall Out\" get primped for yet another U.S. closeup, though the extra gloss on these rerecordings mortgages the brinkofchaos vibe that made Polysics special in the first place. Plus, a lot of the selections are just plain baffling. \"Go Ahead Now!\" and \"Each Life Each End\" are lessthanoptimal highlights from Neu, and the absence of freakout anthems like \"XCT\" or \"Buggie Technica\" feels like a concerted effort to downplay the group's wackier side. Recent singles \"Electric Surfin' Go Go\" and \"YouYouYou\" make a decent case for the band's recent proclivity to powerpop, though even when the latter unleashes its infectious Carslike synth line, it's hard not pining for their more freewheeling material. With their ridiculous getups and cartoonish sound effects, I can understand why many balked at the Brainiac comparisons Polysics initially garnered. Sadly, Vista only confirms those suspicions. Rather than embracing their id via shortcircuiting Moogs and sexually frustrated cyborg rants, the band's indulged in an alltoohuman sweet tooth. Chirpy \"Baby Bias\" sounds like a horrible anime version of \"A Bay Bay\" while the obnoxious spedup chipmunk vocal track on \"Catch On Everywhere\" has reserved a special spot in rock hell. Vista's not an awful release by any means, but it throws egg on the faces of longtime Polysics apologists, and raises the question of whether or not they'll ever care to capitalize on the promising start to their career.
