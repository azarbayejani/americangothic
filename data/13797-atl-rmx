Doubt their cred if you must, but you can't doubt their sincerity: With all due respect, you don't release Witchdoctor albums in 2009 if you're just in it for a quick buck. Beyond that, they eased in naturally since there was always heavy overlap between the fanbases of, say, MF DOOM and \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\". However, ATL RMX departs Adult Swim's safety zone for something more controversially curatorial: something called \"Imma G (Memory Tapes Remix)\" by Dem Getaway Boyz isn't some prank along the lines of Trent Reznor's Strobe Light it's the actual third track here, and pretty typical of what to expect, some of electronic/hiphop's bigger producers reconfiguring a murderer's row of Atlanta rappers who... okay, let's be upfront: If you've had a discussion with someone concerned about the obsolescence of \"lyrical\" hiphop, I'm almost certain you got an earful about how the MCs on ATL RMX are at fault.But even if ElP and Young Jeezy are the battle lines upon which ideological wars about what constitutes \"real\" hiphop are fought, wouldn't it be worthwhile to see if there's any crossover between each's unique and impactful take on urban dystopia? They're both really good at what they do it's worth a shot. But is it worth a listen? Well, ATL RMX's first track, Jeezy's \"I Got This (ElP Remix)\" bangs like crazy, but it does so in a weirdly individualized way. It takes a monster of a beat to make Jeezy sound overwhelmed, and his boasts end up as a nearly incidental sound effect under all those clipemptying drums and enjambed female vocal interjections (this mixtape appears to exist only as a \"clean version\"... that doesn't necessarily help). I'd love to hear more, but maybe if Jeezy heard the beat first? Still, ATL RMX starts out strong: DJA adds a buzzier backing track to Rich Kids' \"Patna Dem\", but it's the irrepressibly emphatic chanting that's going to sell it every time. \"Imma G\" has a strangely sweet and sour tropical taste and essentially becomes a typical Memory Tapes track by its midway point, suggesting Dayve Hawk has incorporated more hiphop into his sound than he's often given credit for. There's also honest to god rapping from CeeLo. If that doesn't justify this mixtape's completely nonexistent download cost, I don't know what to tell you.But elsewhere, the remixers seem compelled to justify their existence/appearance in ways that rarely do any favors to the source material. I suppose SALEM's reverence for both Chapterhouse and Swishahouse will pay off someday, but their decision to chop and screw Playboy Tre's subdued, lyrically potent sipper's lament \"Sideways\" feels like a misunderstanding of the material at best and a joke at worst the last interpretation this sort of thing needs. Many have remarked upon the influence of rave music on Lil' Jon's middecade work, but matched up with the BPMs and sinuseroding coke bump of Danger Beach's \"Give It All You Got\" remix, he hardly sounds revitalized or even relevant. And if HEALTH truly want to make an impact in hiphop, they'll let M.O.P. spit flame over \"Die Slow\", because that shit knocks. Their pounding, dissonant remake of OJ Da Juiceman's \"Good Night\" should be enough to really make M.I.A. rethink boasting her upcoming album as a critwank fantasy of Animal CollectivemeetsGucci Mane. But even whenÂ ATL RMX fails, it represents a discussion worth having though OJ Da Juiceman getting booed at a CMJ showcase served as a flashpoint, it was less \"OutKast gets booed at the Source Awards\" than \"Philadelphia Eagles fans boo Santa Claus,\" an understandable reaction (it was a skinny, poorly dressed Santa/I didn't hear Pill or Curren$y getting booed) with understandable timing (the Eagles were blowing a chance to get the #1 pick, oddly enough, O.J. Simpson/it was hours into a rap show running impossibly late on a Wednesday night) that made an audience with an already hostile rep look irreparably bad. No one comes out looking good, especially in the wake where sides are too easily taken, when hiphop is considered a zerosum game where only one region or mindset can be \"right\" and enjoyed only for the right \"reasons.\" But is it worthwhile at all to wonder if Scott Herren enjoys Shawty Lo \"legitimately\" or whether it's \"correct\" to finally give Gucci Mane a shot only because he's being remixed by Flying Lotus (or vice versa)? Hell, most of hiphop listening these days seems to revolve around conversation anyway, so let's keep it going. Maybe next time we'll hear DOOM over some Zaytoven beats. "}
