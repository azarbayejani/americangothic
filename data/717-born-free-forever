{"label":" Hush","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/712/homepage_large.362bd44b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Dr. Andy Beta","artist":"Bobby Birdman","title":"Born Free Forever","text":" Patient is one Bobby B., youngest child of a collective called \"Invisible Family Shield\" in Pacific NW territory that includes members of Microphones, Yume Bitsu, and Surface of Eceon. Quickwitted, melodic, popular in high school thanks to long hair and witticisms, patient exhibited negligible signs of neurotic disorder until his midtwenties. Unable to ascertain from babbling what caused the acute case of Roky Barrettius Wilsomnia that's riddled his mind. Motor functions are normal, he responds well to social input from friends; patient's cunctation causes him to slur each utterance of simplistic and pseudospiritual rhymes like \"I saw a glimmer...in the eye of any one that...tried...to shine...with...the light from inside...it's unbeatable I find \" at a painful pace. Imitation of George Harrison, bending note for note on \"All Right\" a possibility. Echopraxia and palipraxia continue throughout. Dr. Mitchum has previously reported on the frightening possibility of future patients as irrationally obsessed with Jeff Lynne's career, hair (and moustache/beard) care products, and the seventies studio effects he conjured. Deduce that songs like \"So the Blood\" and \"The Fear\" reveal more the tendency for delusional emulation of whitesuited softy Wayne Coyne. Promises of an innocent ear for melody are present in the above examples, but perceptions have been distorted in Bobby B.'s mind. Instead he finds the sounds of pianos running backwards in dystonic rigidity a pleasing melody, and glitching CDs acceptable rhythmic foundations for his \"songs.\" Commence ODOPA at 1mg per day. External signs of deficiency are tempered at intervals; patient obviously understands his way around a recording environment. The pianos that run forward have a great deal of haunted space to them, mirroring the damaged, wavering, soft singing voice of patient, which makes for voluminous salivation. Could the conceit of \"Fire\" be hoping to channel that of Smile? Not far out of the question, especially given the patient's fondness for such subject matter. Raise dosage to 2mg per day. Patient accomplishes attempt to layer vocal harmonies in a round of incantation, with a simply strummed guitar as accompaniment. Subdued harmonizing as the guitar, air organ, and tambourine reach a mild state; satisfactory, but observers are unable to determine whom the patient is singing with.  Most distressing: patient's inability to organize speech into patterns that express the more complex thoughts usually associated with severe acid damage. Insipid rhymes like \"I Said 'Oh,' the Wind Said 'No!'\" are but one example. Further investigation has yet to unearth any womb/tomb, breath/death, life/strife simplistic word games on more abstract themes, but song titles like \"I Hope/ I Grow\" and \"The Flood/ The Blood\" reveal more grave indications of stoned semantic infatuation. The patient's day work, which he calls Born Free Forever, as an overall realization fails, instead documenting a maddening nondistinct tedium. Suspect oculoglyria and inability to focus. Clinical response is similar to the title of the end track: \"O Come On\". "}
