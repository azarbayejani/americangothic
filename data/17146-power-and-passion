{"label":" Universal","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/18334/homepage_large.0dbb81c7.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jonah Bromwich","artist":"Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire","title":"Power and Passion","text":" Last year, Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire released the great Lost in Translation, a versatile mixtape that introduced his sciencefictionloving, depressive, addictive persona to the world. The tape consisted of angry, fucktheworld celebrations (\"Huzzah!\", \"Triple F\"), lugubrious slow burners (\"Weight of Water\", \"I Should Be Sleepin'\"), pulp pastiche (\"Maltese Falcon Pt. 1 and Pt. 2\", \"Fire Marshall Bill\") and enjoyable offbeat miscellany (\"Chicken Spot Rock\", \"BuildaBitch\"), all over gritty beats. eXquire showed himself to be a pretty good rapper, with patches of outandout brilliance, who had a gift for writing catchy, cathartic songs, and a penchant for extreme emotional outbursts. His first major label offering, the new EP Power and Passion, consists of a direct reiteration of that persona. It's a vulgar, dissonant listen, assisted by fantastic Def Juxstyle production from the likes of ElP and Harry Fraud, and it's wildly inconsistent on a barbybar basis. EPs shouldn't carry excess baggage, but the original, worthwhile material here exists in shards that the listener must piece together, avoiding the weak spots along the way. Most of the unnecessary fat comes in the form of recycled sentiments and lines. eXquire extended a middle finger to the world in \"Triple F\", and the direct retreads on both verses of \"Cheap Whores & Champagne\" and the chorus of \"The Message Pt. 1 & 2\" seem redundant. Much of \"Telephuck\" is just lazy, recycling no fewer than five lyrics from songs past, and not unmemorable ones at that: \"Froze, stonecold, staring at Medusa\" was so striking on first listen that its repetition is simply irritating. Then again, on the very same song, there are some incredibly deft lyrics. \"10 different me's/ y'all don't know how to cope\" is as selfaware a line as you'll find on any early Kanye album, and \"Looking back at the projects, like I'm glad I'm gone/ I left the Cavaliers and never shed a tear,\" is a subtler sports reference than any of Wale or Wayne's thousand ESPNready punchlines. In \"Cheap Whores and Champagne\", towards the end of the first list of people, places, and abstract ideas to which eXquire wants to extend a \"fuck you,\" comes the quick line, \"Fuck trust/ I don't trust trust/ because trust fucked me/ countless times.\" It's that \"countless times\" that holds real weight; that potentially infinite number of betrayals makes it easier to imagine why eXquire is so bitter. When he ignores the haters, puts in some work, and writes a full verse, eXquire hangs onto his capacity to impress. On \"CAri ZALloni\", a dense, hypnotic beat by Dot Da Genius backlights a wonderful example of what eXquire does well, as the Brooklynite shifts his flows casually, pounding away in declarative bars about \"his mind's eye, wide awake at high noon,\" before going into a 50 Centstyle singsong right before the chorus. Unfortunately, there isn't even a second verse, a letdown which foreshadows the issues to come. Near the end of \"The Message Pt. 1 & 2\", there's a telling line. \"Used to rhyme when shit got hectic now this shit be my profession.\" Now that he's been made to do this for a living, eXquire doesn't seem to have much interest in the constant grind required by that life, at least if this tape is any indication. Rappers like Cam'ron and Action Bronson can get away with this kind of inconsistency their stream of consciousness phrasemaking doesn't require much focus. And someone like Gucci Mane, who shows up for a nice turn on \"Telephuck\", doesn't have to focus at all. Nearly everything appealing about him is extralyrical. But eXquire, at his best, is a storyteller. To tell a story, you need to be able to concentrate all the way through. And Power and Passion is blighted by a rapper who seems too distracted by his woes to sit down and write more than a couple of full songs. "}
