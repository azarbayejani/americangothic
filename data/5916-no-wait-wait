Meanwhile, the postflannel altpop of bands like Weezer, the Rentals, or Superchunk isn't cliché per se, but it weaves together guitarpop's mostworn threads: chunky guitars, oohah harmonies, geeky romance lyrics. No Wait Wait, headed by Marc Gartman, aids me in employing a rockwriterly cliché by embracing such touchstones while also subverting them. To Gartman, either love's a joke, or he's just telling himself that. On catchy first single \"The Score\", Gartman sports a Ben Folds slacker drawl as he slips into deep denial about amour. \"There's nothing real about the pain of love,\" he sings on Navy Bluesera Sloanlike opener \"Faith and Words\". A jocularly Jurassic guitar solo only blurs the question. The supine \"A Worried Mind Ventures\" wades into wimpy collegerock with splashes of Murmurera R.E.M. or even Toad the Wet Sprocket, but now Gartman is hiding his hurt behind hep references: \"You are my Nico.\" Apparently his wouldbe Warhol pinup can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground, because in the Joe Jackson pianopop of \"The Luckiest Bastard\" she goes off to \"star\" on Hollywood Blvd., and \"this ain't a Hollywood ending\". Gartman's subject matter is basic, and he doesn't take it far afield, but sometimes he pushes the typical heartache just enough. Much of the album conveys that lyrical content through 90sstyle altpop like that mentioned above, buoyed by hooky synths and raw production. On \"Beaches of the World\", Gartman veers briefly into teenage territory: \"The jocks can't make you laugh/ And the geeks just do your math.\" But often, No Wait Wait offset their upbeat bounce with spacious slowcore, in the classic Low mold, as on the dizzying highlight \"Love's Lost Cause\". No surprise, then that Low's Alan Sparhawk plays in the band, and released the album on his label. While the more deliberately paced songs sometimes drag, they provide a nice addition the record's palette. So Gartman is a bitter, witty, selfdeceiving exromantic who rocks like the recent oldies but steps on the decelerator like a veteran city driver. The songs on No Wait Wait's selftitled review are rarely unique enough to merit a long recall, but they often capture the heart with their lyricism and effervescent melodies. The pain of love is real, Mr. Gartman, but so is the moderate amusement of prettygood power pop. "}
