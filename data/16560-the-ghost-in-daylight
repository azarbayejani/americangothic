Elverum and Kozelek have maintained comparative levels of prolificacy in recent years, implementing subtle changes to their sounds across frequent releases. Talbot hasn't put out an album since 2007, and his records often seemed to bear a blocky stylistic relationship to each other; the focused, Mogwaigonepsych folk of his last album, The Western Lands, followed the textbook gothy strains of 2005's Fires in Distant Buildings. While The Ghost in Daylight purports to continue Gravenhurst's themes of \"compulsion, degradation, and the possibility of transcendence,\" it represents another transition to a more soothing tone, adding an icy despair to Talbot's earlier folkoriented releases.  There's a delicate alchemy to The Ghost in Daylight that can feel precious and a tad forced when compared to The Western Lands, which easily navigated torrid intensity and softer sounds within a single song. The mellotrons, optigans, and synthesizers employed here hang like a silvery mist atop the cyclical fingerpicking that makes up the majority of the album, which either soothes or lulls, depending on your predilection for such softness. It's tempting to allude to a kind of \"Instagram effect\" on some of these songs, particularly when you consider how \"(Carousel interlude)\" the sound of a swirling pump organ obscured by sprays of hiss follows \"In Miniature\", the most unaffected track, but which sings of trying to \"capture the face of a killer,\" \"capture and frame every color,\" with \"each portrait a lifetime in miniature.\" \"Fitzrovia\" ends talking of riots preserved \"In sepia and monochrome/ Double exposure, stopmotion.\" Much here drags on far too long without capturing any particularly exciting colors the alluring Enolike waves at the end of \"Islands\" barely compensate for the saggy, burbling drones that sink the endings of \"Fitzrovia\" and \"The Ghost of Saint Paul\", which sounds like a windchime tuned to play modem noises. As has been written before, Talbot's voice is too benign to carry any great import at its most potent, it's a distant cousin of Girls' Christopher Owens, with the odd chorus key change providing an arresting moment meaning the instrumentation has to do the work for him. But happily, Talbot occasionally lets his old aggressive streak in to rough up the end of a few numbers: the swirling psych guitar at the end of opener \"Circadian\" makes like a mythical, masculine beast tramping through a suburban forest's lingering fog. The unusual (for Talbot) spindly electronic grind of \"Islands\" conjures a space for a dramatic vocal like that of Future Islands' Samuel T. Herring, but instead fills it with a kind of digitized Slowdive echo. The end of \"The Prize\" is knotted into bold metallic ribbons by a fierce violin, a rare use of strings from an artist who'd previously intentionally excluded them from his compositions in case of obvious emotional signposting. He pulls them off, too, sounding not mawkish or sentimental, but gracefully triumphant.  If much of The Ghost in Daylight is underplayed, and occasionally overly subtle, one of its successes lies in how Talbot's lyrics celebrate achievements of the human spirit in others, in a gentle and detached fashion. In \"The Ghost of Saint Paul\", Talbot plainly pays tribute to \"the brave/ To all those resisting,\" and counsels against inadvertent collaboration through inactivity on \"The Foundry\" (the opening of which really sounds like something from Mogwai's recent Earth Division EP). As a onceinahalfdecade demonstration of Talbot's vital signs, The Ghost isn't necessarily compelling enough to make you want to hang around for a followup, but the vitriol of a line like, \"If you let them burn books, you'll let them burn bodies,\" is a strong sign of life at least.
