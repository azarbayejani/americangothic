{"label":" Greedhead","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/16951/homepage_large.46d461c5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Das Racist","title":"Relax","text":" Das Racist always come off as being at least two steps ahead of whomever they're addressing on or off record, which goes a long way toward explaining what made their 2010 mixtapes, Sit Down, Man and Shut Up, Dude, so inexhaustibly fresh and frankly pretty fucking intimidating to encounter as a critic. A style so reliant on selfreference and continuity doesn't appear to leave much to coincidence, so I'm wondering what to make of my suspicions regarding a line that appeared on both of their completely free mixtapes, but not their first commercially available release: \"You should probably buy it.\" This isn't wholly unexpected Heems, Kool AD, and Dapwell can appear unimpressed to a fault, and Relax draws from a rich tradition of antisocial reactions to newfound fame: at times, it's a sour demystification that seeks to define its own backlash à la De La Soul Is Dead, at others a simplified CliffsNotes for people still playing catch up, and a lot of times it simply wants to be Bazooka Tooth. But even as jaded as they sound toward show promoters, industry types, your band, and white dudes on the internet, Relax is a frustrating, occasionally thrilling record that saves its most pervasive indifference for a far more troubling target: itself. Though they've had plenty of laughs at backpacker indie rap's expense, Relax comes alive whenever it strives for an honorary Def Jux badge. ElP and Danny Brown are the most notable appearances, and what's initially jarring is how much the otherwise impermeable Das Racist universe accommodates a sound that caters more toward its guests' respective dystopian styles, forsaking the weededout levity of Sit Down and Shut Up for industrial grind fueled by cheap coke and battery acid. At the outset, they keep up as the brittle title track finds Heems adopting a rawer style to spit a bracing, strikingly plainspoken verse about his upbringing. Meanwhile, \"Michael Jackson\" pays homage to the Chinese fire drill productions of Heatmakerz and AraabMuzik, its brainwashing hook reminiscent of \"Dipset (Santana's Town)\"'s infamous \"like Kurt Cobain was here!\" in terms of chantable celebrity nonsense. When Relax revisits this sort of bludgeoning approach (\"Selena\", \"Punjabi Song\"), you sense the incomplete framework of a record meant to be aesthetically unified and audiencedividing: \"Michael Jackson\" and the other initially punishing tracks shuttle from \"I absolutely cannot stand this song\" to \"I absolutely cannot get this song out of my head\" in about the same amount of time \"Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell\" did. While it would be fascinating to see how their style translates with a mainstream feature (a la Tyler, the Creator's guest spots with Pusha T and the Game), the retrenchment into their inner circle for inspiration rarely feels reactionary here: Yeasayer's Anand Wilder and Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij produce, but without credit, you'd have no idea which tracks are theirs. Likewise, their exercise in total lyrical abstraction with ElP comes more naturally than Sit Down, Man's title track, and \"Power\" is maybe the one track here that can stand up to jawdropping quote machines like \"hahahaha jk?\" or \"Return to Innocence\" thanks to showstealing verses from Danny Brown and Despot. And yet, it's the hook from \"Power\" that gets to the discomforting center of Relax: \"It's too easy. Even if I told you about it, you probably wouldn't even believe me.\" Like many highly intelligent people who can succeed in any number of pursuits, Das Racist sound unimpressed by their own staggering ability (Heems' muchquoted \"I'm fucking great at rapping!\" from \"Michael Jackson\" notwithstanding), as if they got to this point just to see if they could do it, and all of a sudden the actual process of making Relax didn't turn out to be as exciting as planning it. Adopting the same overit tone they've taken during any number of clueless \"hey, these funny guys are really smart!\" interviews, hooks like \"give us all your money... love everybody\" from \"Brand New Dance\" are the sound of their losing interest in real time. If they're kidding, it's an entrylevel joke aimed at...I dunno, proactive behavior in hiphop? But the disengaged tone starts to wear when it becomes unclear whether Kool AD and Heems are still interested in making rap music anymore as opposed to merely listening to it, rattling off disconnected thoughts not too different from the avalanche of their Twitter feeds stray jokes, pancultural namedrops, the occasional astute observation, and a slew of repurposed praise, but no real context to prove broader points. After delivering some of the sharpest cultural criticism in any field on Sit Down and Shut Up, when they swipe at lowhanging fruit like \"rapgenius.com is white devil sophistry/ Urban Dictionary is for demons with college degrees,\" there's little insight, just the whiff of audience/performer codependence. So then what's Shut Up, Dude's \"Rainbow in the Dark\" doing here? It's still a mindblowing piece of work and welcome in any form, but the fit couldn't be more strange both the beat and the lyrics have a generosity in spirit that sheds light on an issue that you can lose sight of while focusing on its attitude or production choices: they're hardly rapping at all here. And when they do, it's almost like 10thseason The Simpsons, where the sheer dropoff in quotability is actually uncomfortable to endure. It's understandable that they'd want to move beyond mere applause for being as handy with Marina Abramovic as they are with Rick Ross' \"9 Piece\", but they've thrown out their entirely unique point of view still their greatest resource with it. While they've made great use of deconstructive syntax, repetition, gibberish, and injokes in the past, too much of Relax simply feels like dead air: the clockwatching countdown of \"Happy Rappy\", the last minute and a half of the title track that sounds like a cackling Autotune meeting its death in a food processor, \"Celebration\" and \"The Trick\"'s listless singing, and \"Punjabi Song\" tripping over its drunk reiteration all merely pass time during tracks already stripped to the bone on a very short record. And while I won't begrudge Das Racist for wanting to make straightup dance tracks like \"Girl\" or \"Booty in the Air\", compared to \"Shorty Said\", \"Irresponsible\", or the many other songs they've made that worked as well in Gchat nerdout sessions as they did in house parties, it's tough to give these onenote riffs the benefit of the doubt. They can do better, but do they even want to? To this point, they've answered the question of \"are they really serious?\" in the affirmative or made it a moot point whether you just liked the Big Punisher quotes, casually accepted being called a white demon for the greater good, or both, their work could be enjoyed on any number of levels. But Relax feels like it's hovering over a more pernicious escape clause \"you don't get it.\" Interpreted through telling lyrics like \"when you see me on the streets, don't bother me,\" \"I don't know why people think we give a fuck so often,\" or, as the closing argument in \"Celebration\" goes, \"you could ask what it is, but I still wouldn't tell you,\" the title of Relax feels more like a statement of aggression, Das Racist shifting the blame to the listener for their own lack of commitment.
