{"label":" Labrador","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/14193/homepage_large.262de2c6.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stuart Berman","artist":"The Legends","title":"Over and Over","text":" As secretive Swedish songwriter Johan Angergård has shown, the upside of fronting a band that doesn't actually exist is that you can make it do whatever you want or don't want it to do, without having to nurse the guitarist's ego or endure the new song your drummer's just written. Over the course of three albums, Angergård's fauxband concept the Legends has been variously reimagined as 1980svintage indie aesthetes (2004's Up Against the Legends), dreary postpunk miserablists (2005's Public Radio) and discothequecourting synthpopsters (2006's Facts and Figures). But, at the same time, the Legends haven't really changed at all. At the core of almost every single song is Angergård's crestfallen voice, so consistent in its ability to convey longing and so unwavering in its forlorn tenor, you'd swear it was some computer preset.Listening to the Legends' discography, one doesn't so much get the sense of an artist undergoing some gradual albumtoalbum evolution, but rather one that tries on and sheds stylistic dressing like paperdoll outfits. On Over and Over, this process is more arbitrary than ever, marking both a return to the liveband, fuzzpop feel of the Legends' beloved first album and further deviations away from it: the album opens with an uncharacteristically melodramatic moperock anthem (\"You Won\", which suggests Oasis if they were more in thrall to early80s Cure than the Beatles) before touching on breezy bongo folk (\"Jump\"), middlegear motorik krautrock (\"Something Strange Will Happen\"), and when all else fails Psychocandied pop squall.Unfortunately for the Legends, this return to their formative mid80s Creation Records influences arrives at a time when those same sources have been recently and thoroughly milked by The Pains of Being Crystal Stilts, and some tracks (\"Always the Same\", \"Recife\") can't help but sound like standardissue riffs on the typical noise/pop dichotomy. But there are instances where all that unrelenting feedback plays more than a simply decorative/desecrating role: on \"Seconds Away\" and the beautifully brooding title track, the whitenoise wash proves to be an uncanny complement for Angergård's emotionally numb vocals, like ghosts communicating through TV static; on the ecstatic garagerock rush of \"Dancefloor\", Angergård's highnote vocals distort to the point of sounding AutoTuned, blurring the line between primal performance and studio science.But if Over and Over encourages the Legends' noisiest impulses, it also tempers the dissonance to showcase some of Angergård's most winsome songwriting since Up Against the Legends: \"Monday to Saturday\" is a snapalong, C86eriffic hesaid/shesaid duet, and \"Heartbeats\" presents its confessions of pillpopping binges and panic attacks in the form of a shimmering, synthswathed slow dance. With its abundance of obtrusive distortion and shufflemode stylistic shifts, Over and Over renders Angergård's as enigmatic and inscrutable a figure as ever. But after two albums that were overly reliant on precise, clinical aesthetics, the roughedged randomness of Over and Over makes the Legends a myth worth believing in again. "}
