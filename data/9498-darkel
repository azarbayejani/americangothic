Unless you count Daft Punk, which of course you do, but Air are still the most famous French electropop duo inspired by Burt Bacharach, and nobody doesn't like \"Walk on By\". Yes, this counts for something. Indeed, Anglophonic critics have sometimes approached Air as a proxy for Frenchness, appreciating not the music's heft, but its kitsch unable to taste the Chardonnay for all the gooey, gooey brie. Nevertheless, the usual surrendermonkey jibes are not just flawed historically, but also an actual impediment to understanding Air's music. What I loved about 1998's Moon Safari and 2004's Talkie Walkie were the bold, explosive gestures: the rocketsurfing synths of \"Kelly Watch the Stars\", the hairraising whistles on \"Alpha Beta Gaga\", and the Zengarden detail of \"Alone in Kyoto\". These heroic flashes emerge within a recherché setting, yes, but they're only complicated by it, not defined. For all the nouveau lounge finery, Air's best songs are grand, melodic voyages. By contrast, the solo debut by Air's JeanBenoît Dunckel waves enough white flags for every soldier in Paris. Recorded while Dunckel and regular collaborator Nicolas Godin were working on the recent Charlotte Gainsbourg album, Darkel has the sparetime feel of a Bside collection, with none of Gainsbourg's breathless charisma. While several of the songs evoke the woozy romance of Air's slower tracks, the usual aplomb of Dunckel's day job is lacking, so many fans may want to hold out for the new Air album due next year.  Still, Darkel isn't without its surprises. The record occasionally brims with the unlikely early 1970s idealism of solo John Lennon. With wobbly piano and acoustic guitar, \"At the End of the Sky\" does \"Instant Karma! (We All Shine On)\" as a love song about time travel and rainbows, while \"My Own Sun\" imagines no possessions but comes closer to \"Oh Yoko!\". On supine piano ballad \"Some Men\", Dunckel whispers: \"Isn't it pretty/ The way we're coming?\" Give the man a few #1 hits and soon he'll be posing naked with Ms. Ono. Sacre bleh.  Even when Dunckel stays closer to type, here he usually relies on unremarkable downtempo beats to support unfortunate spacehippie mewlings. Enviromantra \"Earth\" opens a cappella before hijacking a Liquid Liquid bass line and a synth groove that's a hook and an unzipped Happy Monday shy of Gorillaz' far better \"Dare\". Brooklynstyle loftrattler \"Beautiful Woman\" brings, er, additional cowbell and shrugs at the working world (yup, French). The crunchy new wave of \"Destroy TV\" is kitsch itself, while opener \"Be My Friend\", beatific despite 80s suspensemovie flourishes, would probably make the kind of friends who steal your girlfriend and occupy your country.
