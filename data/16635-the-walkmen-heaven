{"label":" Fat Possum / Bella Union","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/17803/homepage_large.c5b2f354.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jayson Greene","artist":"The Walkmen","title":"Heaven","text":" \"I was the Duke of Earl, but it couldn't last/ I was the pony express, but I ran out of gas.\" This is the first thing Hamilton Leithauser sighs on the Walkmen's new album, Heaven. It is a distinctly unrock'n'roll sentiment. In fact, it sounds like the sort of thing your grandpa might say. Ten years ago, the Walkmen were a magnetic, messy young rock band, and they did all the things we expect young rock bands to do: swung in unexpectedly on friends, drunkdialed exes, pleaded pathetically that things would get better with zero evidence that they would. But over the course of their last two albums, they began receding gracefully into sepia tone: Both You & Me and Lisbon felt like more breezy postcards from abroad than seething dispatches from here. Heaven, their gloriously pretty sixth studio record, marks the moment they shuffle off into that 4x6sized sunset forever. The title they've chosen says it all: Look where they ended up! We all know that's not where rock bands go. Heaven, as Talking Heads famously defined it, \"is a place where nothing ever happens.\" For most sentient people, that sounds like the definition of hell, which Byrne's lyrics admitted: \"It's hard to imagine how nothing at all/ Could be so exciting/ Could be so much fun.\" Similarly, it might not thrill longtime Walkmen fans to picture the band as a bunch of rumpled, beaming dads slotting recording time in between play dates. But on Heaven, they've made a bewildered, giddy paean to their own happiness. Heaven feels infectiously drunk on its own good fortune and kicks out a barstool for you to drink alongside it. It helps that Hamilton Leithauser, with his oddly aristocratic presence, remains a magnetic frontman even when he's basically taking a song to make googoo noises at his oneyearold daughter (the lovely if borderlinesaccharine \"Song for Leigh\"). There was always something airily entitled in Leithauser's onrecord persona; he was the rich kid who didn't have to do his homework, because he knew you'd do it if he asked. That this kid had feelings too was a fundamental dramatic premise of the Walkmen. To hear this former kid now ruminating on bigpicture stuff, like the statistical improbability of lasting love (\"Love Is Luck\") or the emptiness of perfection (\"We Can't Be Beat\") is to hear the band's purview expand quietly. On \"Southern Heart\", he even plays a pleasantly tired cuckold, like the Leonard Cohen of \"Famous Blue Raincoat\": \"Tell me again how you loved all the men you were after,\" he mutters. Some longtime fans might not like their Walkmen like this. They were great, after all, at being sexily unstable. But this retroyearning tendency has been there since the beginning if you looked for it. So to hear them ease out of sturmunddrang and into something resembling durable adulthood is to witness a great rock band evolve along a logical path. In what may be a tacit acknowledgement of this shift, Heaven glows with nostalgic prerock'n'roll sounds: \"Jerry Jr.'s Tune\" is oneandahalf moonlit minutes of classic doowop; \"No One Ever Sleeps\" has a faint mariachisounding horn section; \"Love Is Luck\" is a sparkling calypso song. \"Heartbreaker\" echoes the chords, melody and rhythm of \"Be My Baby\". All of the Walkmen's albums have been recorded with meticulous, stonecutting care; by now, listening to them is like entering a room where you can tap your foot in corners to test its resonance. \"We Can't Be Beat\", one of a few songs on Heaven rounded out with harmonies from Fleet Foxes' Robin Pecknold, eases into a fullband march after about two minutes of wry, twinkling acoustic guitar. On \"Line By Line\", Leithauser croons tenderly over a single rippling guitar until a string section gradually soaks in at the song's edges. The beery, cockeyed \"No One Ever Sleeps\" transforms the Walkmen into a schmaltzy gypsy band serenading the outdoor tables at a whitetablecloth restaurant. This group has always been able to carve out dramatic gestures like this, and even at this end of the spectrum far beyond personal explosions and exclamationpointed delivery they continue to craft music of wry vitality. It may be that they can no longer convincingly deliver tortured, existential desperation, and if so, that's just as well. With Heaven, they've turned out a record that finds a thousand affecting variations on contented hum. "}
