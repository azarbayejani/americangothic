{"label":" Tree","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/2389/homepage_large.68a38a5e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nick Mirov","artist":"Julie Doiron","title":"Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars","text":" \"Anyone is pretty when she smiles; me, I'm only pretty when I cry,\" sings Julie Doiron on her new album. And I'll be damned if you don't just want to hold her, and maybe spend the whole day curled up under a blanket with her, staring out the window at the grey Canadian winter. A solid dose of comforting, resolute melancholy can be good for the soul sometimes, and despite being the most upbeat album of Doiron's musical oeuvre (thanks in part to having a real backing band this time out), Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars still delivers the 100% RDA. Like Bettie Serveert's Carol van Dijk without the sunny smiles, Beth Orton without the reverb chamber and the Chemical Brothers connection, or Jenny Toomey on Xanax, Doiron has a natural ache in her voice that manages to sidestep both wistful whimsy and wretched despair. Her previous solo work seemed to be a bit too stark and fourtracky to distinguish itself from the rest of the alreadysaturated moperock market; here, she teams up with fellow Canadians the Wooden Stars to create a much warmer, more fully developed sound which supports her vocal timbre a bit better. There are still plenty of beautiful downbeat moments, like \"The Longest Winter\" (\"Not even the prank calls/ Are helping pass the time anymore\") or \"Seven.\" But it's also surprisingly pleasant to hear Doiron fit herself into slightly different clothes, such as on the perky, almost Cardiganslike \"Dance Music\" and the stiff, insistent bounce of \"The Best Thing for Me.\" Although eleven songs and 42 minutes long, Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars still seems a bit slight. Maybe it's because it's a rather easy, effortless listen, albeit something you'd only put in your stereo once in a while. But like hot chocolate on a cold night, it has its proper time and place. "}
