While there's something to be said for knockyouonyourass sonics and bewildering originality, the albums that resonate the most are often the ones that find a way to work themselves seamlessly into the routines and rituals of daily life. In the three years since the release of the Exploding Hearts' Guitar Romantic, there have been very few days that I haven't felt tremendously grateful that I can have my morning coffee with the opening chords of \"Modern Kicks\". To accuse the Hearts of relying upon clich√©s would be missing the point entirely the instantaneous familiarity of the band's music gives it ample room to develop and multiply as a kind of emotional prosthesis. Speaking strictly in terms of influences and aesthetics, the Hearts aren't all that remarkable. There's certainly no shortage of bands that have touched on the work of Nick Lowe, the Buzzcocks, and the Undertones.But the Hearts found a way not just to interpret and relate the music they love, but also to express that love in their own work. In many ways, the Exploding Hearts embody an immeasurably valuable and increasingly frownedupon way of relating to music; Guitar Romantic strikes me not just as a great album, but as a reminder of why we need great albums in our lives. That the Exploding Hearts need to be written about in past tense is beyond painful; only months after the release of their debut album, singer Adam \"Baby\" Cox, bassist Matt \"Lock\" Fitzgerald, and drummer Jeremy \"Kid Killer\" Gage died in a car crash on their way from San Francisco to Portland. Shattered collects all of the band's nonalbum material, including a handful of singles, unreleased tracks, and alternate mixes culled from the German vinyl release of Guitar Romantic. It's a complete, welldone and respectful package, and makes the entirety of the band's remaining material available cheaply and easily.  The singles on Shattered show the Hearts at their most straightforwardly powerpop \"Busy Signals\" and \"Shattered (You Left Me)\" would be right at home on a Teenline compilation. \"(Making) Teenage Faces\" is as dumb lyrically as it is smart musically, starting with a nasally schoolyard chant and ending with a drum fill that directly quotes \"Radio Radio\". It's a completely representative intersection of shameless musical nerddom and punk rock posturing, and one of the most infectious songs the band has ever recorded.  Alternate versions of \"Modern Kicks\", \"Throwaway Style\", \"Thorns In Roses\", \"Still Crazy\", \"I'm a Pretender\", and \"Black and Blue\" are generally muddier and less focused than their album counterparts. No, this collection is not as strong as Guitar Romantic. And yes, the pleasure it evokes is largely the pleasure of hearing more music any music from one of your favorite bands. But it's a kind of pleasure that the Hearts earned not because of the band's tragic end, but rather because their music exudes a willingness to become an inextricable and irreplaceable part of your life.
