Maybe, maybe not. Bambaataa did hook up with Tommy Boy founder, Tom Silverman, though, and the dominoes tumbled. Twentyfive years later and the influence of \"Planet Rock\" is still heard on a daily basis, from the freshest Southern anthems to Visa commercials, so it's no surprise Tommy Boy, in conjunction with Rhino, chose Bambaataa staples and related tangents as the meat of this 2xCD tale. Fortunately for us, these songs, like all great pop singles, cannot be diminished by repetition, imitation, or the patina of age, so their inclusion here is less resuscitative than contextual, placing the songs in Tommy Boy's early genealogy instead of another redundant old school compendium. Sounds fun, right? Well, it is, and this is due to the compilers' utter lack of pretension or revisionist cool. Yeah, \"Planet Rock\" and \"Looking for the Perfect Beat\" are unimpeachably awesome, but Information Society is less so, yet somehow, its 80s onehit \"What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)\" is as inoffensive here as it ever will be. The Tommy Boy Story seems familiar even by Tommy Boy's compilationhappy standards but, by shaking its skeletons and dispensing with the dustier artifacts, it succeeds in making what could have been another nostalgia yard sale sound and look surprisingly new. The newness is not in the material itself; most of this is readily available or a slightly altered edit of readily available. The fresh feeling comes from the tastefully selected, onestop quality that evades when these songs are tucked into a 5xCD boxset or a fatfilled, overambitious compilation. The focus is narrow and the story is straightforward. In the beginning, there was Afrika and so on. Disc 1 draws the electroline from \"Planet Rock\" through the throbbing heartbreak of Club Nouveau to the acid house godfathers, 808 State's \"Pacific 0101\", a rareish remix originally available on a promo single. Disc 2 goes Bamlite, with only \"Jazzy Sensation\", and traces its lineage through the aforementioned Info Society and protohiphopsoul of the Force M.D.'s (a must for humptapes). This second side makes closer connects with the simultaneous house and techno movements in Chicago and Detroit, respectively, by focusing on the Latininfluenced freestyle of guys like Joey Gardner, \"Little\" Louis Vega, and the Latin Rascals. It might not be as infinite, but it's a good intro to an underappreciated strain of dance music. Check Queen Latifah's sweaty, whisperedword \"How Do I Love Thee\" and the screwedKraftwerk and vocoder of \"Salsa Smurph\". Packaged to resemble a 12\" record sleeve, The Tommy Boy Story, Vol. 1 is more concerned with getting spins at a party than being a completist's anthology, and unless you need to own various versions of \"Pack Jam\", this will probably do you just fine. Consider a handsfree DJ set, and remember to play K7's \"Come Baby Come\" when you're ready for people to go home. "}
