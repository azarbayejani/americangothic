Unsurprisingly, this played exceptionally well on indierap message boards, in coffee shops, and college campuses coast to coast. But outside the Ivy, where people eat, laugh, fuck, and don't spend a hell of a lot of time thinking about whether their culture is eroding, it didn't make a dent. It's easy for the (over)educated among us to get hip to the underground and then snicker at the poor deluded masses filling their heads and ears with trash, but what happens when we have to step outside our theoryaddled cocoons and explain looking down our noses at our neighbors and kin? Confronted with his aging, stillhustling \"niggas on the corner,\" Phonte illuminates this dilemma in a single line \"they ask me if The Minstrel Show means I'm ashamed of them\" but in truth the whole of Little Brother's third fulllength, Getback, represents a brasstacks attempt at figuring out just why he and Pooh are rapping, and for whom. The project's essentialist nature is evident not only in the brevity of its composition (11 songs in under 50 minutes) but also its cast, one man short with the departure of the group's producer and biggest name 9th Wonder (who does make a cameo return to handle \"Breakin' My Heart\"). That leaves the sonics in the stead of a motley collection of beatmakers, most notably Talib Kweli collaborator HiTek (who helms the languid, gently whirring \"Step It Up\") and Alister Nottz (the soulful, celebratory \"Two Step Blues\"). The man with the most credits (four), however, is relative unknown Illmind, who submits a mixed bag between the toobusy \"Sirens\" and the smoothly reflective \"That Ain't Love\", ultimately failing to make anyone forget even the modest legacy of 9th's work with the group.  Still, this is undoubtedly Phonte and Pooh's party, and all the fascination and frustration of Getback lies in listening to two MCs struggle to decide where they belong. Redherring opener \"Sirens\" may be politically charged, but the record's real headspace is set with the succeeding track, \"Can't Win For Losing\", in which Phonte rejects fans, family and scenes as sufficient motivations for enduring the hiphop grind before embracing friend and mentor Jazzy Jeff's trenchant advice of \"fuck 'em, 'Te, do it for you.\"  Belief in self is great, of course, but as the poignant refrain of one song puts it, \"dreams don't keep the lights on,\" and the remainder of Getback is preoccupied with how to juggle ideals and financial realities, individual dreams and the reciprocity of relationships, even the aesthetic choice between whether to crack jokes or talk tough. The uproarious \"Good Clothes\" and \"Step It Up\" attest that the duo (particularly Phonte) is capable of crafting highly clever hiphop (\"a nigga can't attract Cristal with a Boone's Farm mindstate\"), but the flashes of quick wit are regrettably few and far between. Instead, untrustworthy friends (\"That Ain't Love\") and demanding females keep marring Pooh and Phonte's good moods, bringing out grumpily regressive sides of their personalities that don't suit the typically easy charm of either MC (sure, no one gets skeeted on, but \"a woman's life is love/ A man's love is life\" is a subtly offensive maxim).  It's telling that Little Brother sounds happiest on \"Two Step Blues\", an ode to the simple joys of shaking off the 9to5 and cutting a rug at the VFW with old family and friends. With all the acclaim they've earned and controversy they've courted, however, this unglamorous, downhome utopia might actually be the toughest for Phonte and Pooh to bring to life.  "}
