{"label":" Bpitch Control","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/3241/homepage_large.5be53006.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Scott Plagenhoef","artist":"Sascha Funke","title":"Bravo","text":" When the recent wave of German electronic music gets its proper bigtime compilation treatment, it will take a couple of Nuggetsstyle box sets to do it justice. From Mouse and Mars and Oval through today, German artists and German labels such as Basic Channel, Tresor, Force Tracks, Mille Plateaux, Morr Music, Studio !K7, Kompakt, Bpitch Control, Perlon, Shitkatapult, Poker Flat Recordings, and Playhouse, among many others, have produced an uncanny amount of excellent electronic music. On this fictional compilation, Sascha Funke would be well represented by his lovely, plangent \"Drei Auf Drei\", his cover of Bros' \"When Will I Be Famous\", and \"Now You Know\", the opening track on his debut album, Bravo. \"Now You Know\" is an almost improbably gorgeous track, a brittle, bittersweet techhouse beauty that sounds soulenriching even as its enveloping layers of analog synth, arpeggiated guitar, and staccato beats are whittled down, peeled away like an onion until Funke's plangent, fragile voice is exposed. Previously released on the Funkt 12inch, it's not only thankfully included here but along with the record's other previously released track, \"Forms and Shapes\" sets its tone and works as its sonic blueprint. Much of the rest of the largely cohesive Bravo uses those two tracks as a jumpingoff point. It splits the difference between Funke's two labels (Cologne's Kompakt and Berlin's Bpitch Control), taking the warmth of the former and the crisp, sharp beats of the latter, and oddly adding a large splash of borderline MOR sentimentality. Within this seemingly confining set of templates, Funke squeezes a surprising range of sounds, from the digital disco of vocal track \"Forms and Shapes\", to the almost Underworldesque progressive house of the title track, to the quivering clicks of \"Soso\", a Notwistlike track that just begs for a Markus Acher vocal. When Funke veers into ambient pop as he does in much of the record's final third, starting with the selfexplanatory \"Quiet Please\" Bravo sometimes slides into more murky, less interesting territory, rescued only by the odd, minimalist charm of \"3 zu 1 fur die Liebe\" and percolating closer \"Hallo and Hurra\". But despite the occasional middling, soggy production, Bravo shows Funke deftly combining his yin and yang, creating an almost autumnal album full of brisk, soft numbers. How do you say \"sweater weather\" in German? "}
