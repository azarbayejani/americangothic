{"label":" Johnny23","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/4890/homepage_large.9f823449.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Rollie Pemberton","artist":"LoDeck","title":"Dream Dentistry","text":" One of the defining features of underground hiphop is how the two most contentious factors to success are so opposite. The artists with the largest fanbases are either deeply rooted in tradition or defined by their eccentricity. The ones with the most important impact, however, have a certain way of combining both portions into a single, equal serving. Falling upon this ambiguous subregion is Johnny23 Records CEO and artist LoDeck, with his debut LP, Dream Dentistry. A concise arrangement of philosophical pondering and bassheavy beats, the album is driven by Deck's rhyming style. He writes like Aesop Rock mixed with Redman, but his hungover, rusty, cracking New Yorker vocals and devilmaycare charisma call for comparison to rappers like Sticky Fingaz and MF Doom. In short: LoDeck raps like the Ivy League freshman that went to Daytona Beach for Spring Break and never came back to school. A natural New Yorkdirty punchline master, LoDeck attempts to power you into his fanclub with subtle jabs and crosses. Not only is he \"too ill/ Like EazyE at 'Tha Crossroads',\" but if he's \"too predictable,\" he'll \"twist up like Blanka.\" Even when he spits out \"The Russian ain't playin'/ My real name is Boris,\" his delivery redeems the randomness of the line. His concepts include the negatives of the idiot box on \"Inside the TV\", the misunderstandings surrounding the societal standing of underground emcees on \"Applause\" (\"You want a satellite dish? All us rappers are rich!\"), and the nature of affection on the aptly titled \"Love\". LoDeck's major issue is that his meandering streamofconsciousness flow often sacrifices coherency, topical restraint and consistency for a tighter flow, which, by the end of most of his tracks, tends lose any of the concepts he began with. It does make for an enjoyably raw listening experience but a level of sustained conceptual depth could help him to cross the bridge into Classic County. \"Word is Virus\" is a highlight, regardless of the lame freezing glitchhop beat and corny vocal sample, featuring Paramount and subunderground superhero Mac Lethal. After LoDeck proclaims his \"loopy crew acts like soccer thugs with one goal\" and that he's \"blessed with the same charm that freezes cobras,\" Paramount sleepwalks through a floworiented verse, leaving room for Lethal to steal the show. Opening by pantomiming Beanie Sigel, Mac twists and contorts his delivery around his Midwest battle style, offering a loose, bouncy alternative to the stark ambiguity of Deck and Paramount: \"Your crew's about as thuggy as the Shriners/ Rocking turbans made out of trash can liners.\" Flanked by producers FredONE, Chum Chopz, Big DeEP and perennial Aesop Rock beatmaker Blockhead, the beats on Dream Dentistry definitely disappoint when paired with LoDeck's vocal assault. The Blockhead compositions rise above the others with the aura of professionalism that made LoDeck's Bash It! EP such a stark triumph unfortunately, nothing on this record touches \"Stethoscope Alley\" or \"I Pollute\" in the realm of production. Chum Chopz, in particular, is hit/miss. \"Watchtower\" runs romper stomper with hard drums and a spiral staircase bassline that works well, but \"Love\" is rendered almost unlistenable by tinny guitar licks and a sloppy choral vocal sample. Of course, even if his lack of song structure and freeform rhyming throws some people off, LoDeck has clearly evolved his lyrical status since the ridiculously dope Bash It! EP; it's just that, here, he's lost the beats, and still yet to gain songwriting focus. His next project could hold a deeper listening experience; in the meantime, Dream Dentistry remains a powerful testament to his novel rap style. "}
