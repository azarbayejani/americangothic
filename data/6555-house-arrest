That he's not unabashedly L.A. and doesn't get off on tickling our FM culture pleasure areas. That he doesn't deliberately sculpt his Brian Wilson/California weirdosongwriter mythology to a T. That he doesn't pretend he invented genrebending lofi. Got all that? Good, here's the kicker House Arrest is just another slightly above average album from Pink; controversy and fanfare be damned. It's a shame there's so much baggage with Pink's albums, but he hasn't exactly shied away from selfaware selfpromotion. Opener \"Hardcore Pops Are Fun\" contains the line \"Pop music is good/ It sounds like it should/ Pop music is mine/ It tastes so divine.\" Next song has Pink \"getting interesting results\" whenever he \"thinks of a band\" and \"sits down and tries,\" further pondering in the second verse whether he'll write a good song today. The track ends with a halfassed attempt at selfdeprecation (\"I'm not going to try anymore\"), but further reinforces the fundamental beef surrounding Pink the dude tries too hard to be pop's puppet master, possessing the last 50 years of tuneful feelgoodness at his fingertips. I never thought I'd be saying this in an age of Coldplay and reality TV melodrama, but Pink's slapdash compositions could actually use some sentimentality, or at least gravitas, amidst the rapidfire nostalgia. Some say Pink's expansivenessforemotiveness tradeoff works, but it feels like hors d'oeuvres in place of a scrumptious dessert. No doubt about it, Pink demonstrates a knack for hooks, however, and House Arrest comes as close to bare bones pop rock as Pink gets. So many of these tracks start strong, flashing GBV or Olivia Tremor Controlsized melodies only to botch them with threeplus minutes of \"experimental\" noise fodder. For 90 seconds \"The People I'm Not\" is the catchiest, tightest fake Elvis Costello track I'v heard, but it quickly disintegrates into a boring bridge and threeminute outro sounding nothing like the song's beginning. Despite its hokey meta, \"Interesting Results\" taps one of Robert Pollard's singalong choruses and bitesized AORvia8track swagger. Pink's bankrupt Beck act ultimately bleeds through the majority of House Arrest ; his poor use of samples and rhythm sections make for one very unfunky white boy. Two kooky breakdowns bookend \"Almost Waiting\", but the soulless Bee Gees imitation in the middle unjustly separates them. The title track cracks up over its own joke, playing an answering machine message chastising Pink for failing to pay parking tickets before launching into a highly ADHDaffected mishmash. Unable to congeal for 10 coherent seconds, the track sheds new light on the Ariel Pink debate: It's not that he's too pretentious with his work, he's obviously too insecure to show his songwriting at face value.
