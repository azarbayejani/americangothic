It all starts with the songs, and for a minute there, Sweet was churning them out, one powerpop nugget after the next.The price of success is inevitably calls for more of the same, but for the past several years Sweet's been a lot more hit or miss, settling into cult status with a series of soso releases that didn't so much coast on earlier glories as fail to live up to them. Albums such as 1999's restless In Reverse or the initially Japanonly Kimi Ga Suki were best when they came closest to Girlfriend, at least in spirit (the latter even featured most of Sweet's Girlfriendera band). Sweet subsequently treaded water with buddies Pete Droge and Shawn Mullins as the inconsequential Thorns, and his 2006 covers disc with pal Susanna Hoffs mined the obvious: the 1960s.This all sets up Sweet for a big comeback. Sunshine Lies isn't it. Sweet's eased into the solid but rarely exceptional point in his career. He's consistent to a fault. The guy needs a challenge, and longevity alone doesn't seem to be it. On \"Room to Rock\", Sweet sounds eerily like Tom Petty, while \"Byrdgirl\" well, the title alone gives the game away, though \"Daisychain\" is even Byrdsyer. Meanwhile, Lloyd's lead guitar livens up the likes of \"Flying\", enough so that his absence on most of the disc's other tracks is somewhat glaring. Sweet at his best at his most gentle, as with the lovely \"Feel Fear\" or \"Pleasure Is Mine\".In his defense, Sweet (like Petty) has managed to cobble together his own identity out of all the giants he references, but that just makes overlyfamiliar songs such as \"Burn Through Love\" and the anticlimactic closer \"Back of My Mind\" (which features more awesome work from Lloyd) so disappointing. \"Solid\" doesn't suit a guy who's shown he can do better. As much work as Sweet clearly put into this disc, hearing him glide instead of soar makes it all sound too easy, which sadly makes it that much easier to forget. "}
