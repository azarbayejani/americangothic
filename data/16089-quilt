{"label":" Mexican Summer","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/17236/homepage_large.4efbefc9.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Emilie Friedlander","artist":"Quilt","title":"Quilt","text":" Quilt is an East Coast group of Anna Fox Rochinsk, Shane Butler, and John Andrews. They've been touring the basement show circuit and putting out occasional, limitedrun releases since 2009, although I hadn't heard of them until this year's SXSW festival, when my band shared a makeshift wooden stage with them, at an unofficial backyard showcase in South Austin, hosted by WNYU. The odor of smoke, brisket, and crawfish stew seemed the perfect accompaniment to their twangy, somewhat ramshackle blend of 1960s psychedelia, mantric blues, and folk, and I remember realizing that they were the first band I had heard all week whose vocal parts included classic, threepart harmonies and whose use of a Farfisa was less retrofuturistic than straightup retro. Quilt sounded kind of like a flashback to a time, not so long ago, when Sunburned Hand of the Man made the cover of The Wire under the banner of \"New Weird America,\" and artists like Devendra Banhart and Six Organs of Admittance prompted indie music fans to snap up reissues of outsider folk records by Vashti Bunyan, Jandek, and Alexander \"Skip\" Spence. The members of Quilt are probably old enough to remember and have been impacted by a time roughly around the midaughts when the global economy was still in a boom phase rather than a bust, and much of the independent music community seemed bent on expressing its independentmindedness through an ethos of retreat: out of the city and into the woods, back through the years to the screaming guitar solos and of the hippy generation and the vulnerable rawness of AngloAmerican folk singing, inward to the depths of the psyche and the eccentricites of character. The thing that struck me most about Quilt, at the time, was not that they seemed to be backtracking to a revivalist movement in recent memory that was not exactly their generation's own; it was that the particular reference points they were drawing on simply weren't ones I had heard in a while. Like their namesake, Quilt's music feels handmade and stitchedtogether, as though its creators were sifting through a collection of musical handmedowns and collating the bits that spoke to them into something new. This patchwork quality extends not only to their juxtaposition, say, of Neil Young bassbounce and the kind of halfspoken poetic narration you might hear on one of the Incredible String Band's early records, but to their melodic sensibility at large, which favors tightly interlocking arrangements of simple motifs. The band's writing process, so they say, consists in endlessly improvising on a collection of predetermined chord progressions, and the resulting intricacy comes particularly to the fore on their selftitled debut for Mexican Summer, which they recorded with the help of Apollo Sunshine's Jesse Gallagher in the summers of 2010 and 2011. Percussion work was split between founding drummer Taylor Mcvay and John Andrews, who has since replaced her. Quilt unfolds in a series of vividly colored scenes, ranging from the hushed suspense of opener \"Young Gold\" to bouncy, open road cruisers like \"Cowboys in the Void\" and \"Penobska Oakwalk\", and the lovesick sweetness of \"Utopian Canyon\", which casts Fox Rochinski's crystalline soprano front and center. Shifts in tempo and key occur frequently within a single song, with Butler and Fox Rochinski trading off the narration as vocal harmonies move like tectonic plates around the central melodic line. On standout \"Cowboys in the Void\", a snaky guitar duel enhances our impression of theatrical tension until an unexpected vocal yelp comes along and dispels it, capturing all the terror and exhilaration of jumping into the titular unknown. Again, there's the creeping sensation that we have heard a lot these melodies and transitions and echoing guitar notes before. Either they replicate specific moments in the history of 20thcentury American music that we cannot concretely pin down, or they are designed to reflect a set of unwritten expectations and parameters the kind of collective sensibility that allows us to predict how the slightly detuned, chromatic banjo pattern on closer \"Gome Home\" might resolve itself at the end of the phrase, for example, or identify this music as \"Americana,\" or distinctly \"American,\" even if we are unable to say what those words really mean. In its less captivating passages, which are few, Quilt will sound like a pitchperfect rendition of some 1969 acidfolk reissue that was never quite as memorable as you hoped. At its most exhilarating, the record may recall a time when you blasted a song like \"California Dreamin'\", and thought about how doubly thrilling it must have been when your parents first experienced it, and it actually sounded unlike anything they had ever heard. The members of Quilt couldn't possibly have predicted the impact of the call for change that would originate from their own generation just a few months after they completed the record, but they do seem strangely prescient on \"Children of Light\", when they sing, \"We're going off to war/ Not like the one before.\" As for imagining what a politically engaged music of the ygeneration might sound like, and how it might differ from that of the baby boomers, Butler offers up some curious food for thought on \"Penobska Oakwalk\": \"Why would we try, why should we try to make anew/ When we could be intoxicated by this ordinary turn again?\" "}
