{"label":" Epitaph","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/9656/homepage_large.73b286fa.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jason Crock","artist":"Busdriver","title":"RoadKillOvercoat","text":" There's a moment near the end of Busdriver's bewildering latest single, \"Kill Your Employer\", where, after several patchins and adlibs, you hear the following muffled aside over a doorknocker beat: \"I don't join the ranks of ordinary men/ I burn flags, not oil reserves/ I'm no exfootball player Iraqi combatant... who the fuck you think you're talking to? It's me...\" Well, no shit. No one's going to mistake that CheshirecatonRitalin voice, no matter how much Busdriver may slow down and variate his flow. However, RoadKillOvercoat may be as far outside Busdriver's comfort zone as he can get: a slower, weirder, and less complacent record than he's ever done. DJ's Nobody and Boom Bip provide beats that draw from a wider range of styles and flirt with an alien, psychedelic edge, giving Busdriver enough room to be as weird as he wants to be. Tracks like \"Secret Skin\" could be the soundtrack to a fantasygorged Skittles commercial with its horseclop drums and citrusacid guitars, and closer \"Dream Catcher's Mitt\" is a campfire strum loaded with unusually saccharine verbosity from Busdriver. No more jazzflute samples, no more backpacker aftertaste. Can we blame him, though? 2005's Fear of a Black Tangent merged highly accessible beats with some of his sharpest and most sardonic observations, mostly on himself and his place in the marketplace. Critics who didn't get the joke suggested Busdriver didn't either, that he was bitter and lashing out. With that album he focused, and it didn't really pay off. Now, rather than bemoan his standing, he's actually trying to change it. Busdriver is no longer comfortable among the young intelligentsia, and he's even turned to bite the hands that've fed him in the disc's two pieces de resistance, \"Kill Your Employer\" and \"Sun Shower\", the latter sniping at sheltered art school attendees.  Drawing the listener in with a current, edgy beat just to smack them with a nearpsychedelic chorus and a nearimpenetrable lyric (\"Post recreational paranoia is the sport of now\") is a mischievous trick on \"Employer\", and the track for \"Sun Showers\" is more ominous, atmospheric rock than rap. But while \"Sun Shower\" is terribly catchy and uncompromising, Busdriver sounds awkward over it. More than that, his targets here seem illdefined, and lyrics that might work as (and should be) throwaways hog attention: \"wellpruned yuppie scum,\" spoiled \"artschool kids\" and other hapless bourgeoisie in \"Sun Shower\", or kids \"smearing salad on [their] SUV\" and the aforementioned \"exfootball playing Iraqi combatants\" in \"Kill Your Employer\". These criticisms are a little too easy, especially coming from a guy who's displayed more subtlety and wit when freestyling at a drivethru window. Busdriver is smarter than this.  Not that RoadKillOvercoat is a complete 180 opener \"Casting Agents and Callgirls\" crams hooks like lastminute travelers stuffing a suitcase, but follower \"Less Yes's, More No's\" could have fit comfortably on Black Tangent with its scraping stungun beat, and the latter half of the disc returns to more sparse beats and rap aerobatics of his earlier career with tracks like \"Pompous Posies! Your Party's No Fun\" or \"(Bloody Paw on the) Kill Floor\". And there are other moments where he fits just fine in new contexts: The sugary sampling of \"The Troglodyte Wins\" is poppy but bare, and his delivery is what sells it, sounding like he's dancing among the new drapes when he's actually skewering America's current head of state. Then there's \"Mr. Mistake (Bested by the Whisper Chasm)\", a more introspective and intimate song where Busdriver lowers his tone to a multitracked monotone whisper. It's a highly effective curveball that's still pretty pop, and proves Busdriver could have broke new ground without stretching himself to the extent he has here.  I wouldn't fault an underground wunderkind for pushing himself out of his comfort zone, and there's only a few moments overall where Busdriver's a square peg in a round hole (it's just a shame those moments are the album's centerpieces). It sounds like a guy who doesn't want to be at a party, but grimaces and turns up the charm to paraphrase an old Dismemberment Plan lyric, he sounds like himself, but more so. Maybe some thought Busdriver sounded selfsatisfied before, but he used to sound one step ahead of the listener instead of running to catch up.  "}
