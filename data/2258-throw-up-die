{"label":" Retard Disco","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/2239/homepage_large.1d84e728.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Gene Defcon","title":"Throw Up & Die","text":" In small doses, Gene Defcon's short, exuberant blasts of obnoxiousness (like a gluesniffing Atom and His Package) are not without charm. Plenty of catchy DevomeetstheRamones melodies and incredulous yuks in the first 10 tracks of his \"75minute partyrock concept album.\" \"I'm Not a Scoreboard\" finds Gene wrapping his adenoidal voice around boneheaded puns in the grand old tradition of \"Are You Jimmy Ray?\". \"People always ask me, what's the score?/ I'm not a scoreboard/ I'm not the sports page.\" \"Come Party With Me\" seems to parody Sugar Ray's \"Every Morning\", outdoing the sluggish fratska of the original. The squelchy rockrap number, \"Rockin' Your Bones\", will tickle people who find rap inherently funny (P.S. I hate you), and what's not to like about \"Mr. President\", a revisionist presidential assassination narrative? The Postal Service got away with it, and they were serious! After a mere 20 tracks, thematic repetition creeps in: Gene likes to party, and invites us to party with him. There's the hoppedup surf rock (like the Beach Boys' \"Fun Fun Fun\" on crank) of \"Shut Me in a Cage\" and the circus synths of \"Hey (You Wanna Party with Gene Defcon?)\". \"All the teenage girls and boys are on hard drugs/ All the twentysomething alcoholics look so smug/ The lesbian cyberchicks are having crazy sex/ I raise my glass to all these party people with respect.\" All right dude. I get it. We've been going in sets of 10, but it's time to sprint. Meet me at track 40. Track 40, \"My Girlfriend Is a Mexican\". I am not well. In the tradition of all parties that last too long, I've been in a walking blackout for the last 20 tracks. And there are still six more! Let's see, what's next...\"I Love You More Than Any PastaFed DingDong\". Peg me as a joyless Morlock if you want if this is joy, I'll take clinical depression.  "}
