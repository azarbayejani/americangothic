Heat Chief is a record that makes no sense if not played on speakers, and on vinyl; the fidelity is otherwise too off, the editing and ideas too tentative. On headphones it's a claustrophobic nightmare, a petty collection of scrapes and wavering tones passed off as finished and only on wax, and loud, does it burst. This Baltimore quartet, who pronounce their name \"Wet Hearts,\" are like the newer Boredoms, the New Orleans guitarsustain devotees Belong, or the mouthbreathing, oming New Yorkers Double Leopards in search of a kind of transcendence through repetition and incremental adjustments. They find it in their own way: Though they allude, convincingly and often, to the Boredoms' Seadrum/House of the Sun, their best moments are their most processed long, humid, sustained tones and almost desultory, lagging, melodic progressions. In one spot static, drenched in echo, cascades over the circled drum patterns spun out by Shaun Flynn; in another, ghostly drips fall as their gradually echoed pings of sound bounce down different registers, their colors changing as they gradually fade. Heat Chief's third movement rises, dark and ugly all toms and guttural noise while the fourth and final is the complete opposite, morning light gradually filtering into a cave. To say it plain, Heat Chief could've been brilliant it isn't on CD, or in headphones, or anywhere else its remarkably poor fidelity and mix are audible and on my halfbroken, staticy stylus, comes pretty close.
