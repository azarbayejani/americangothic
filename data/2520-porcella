{"label":" In the Red","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/2498/homepage_large.3937cd1b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amanda Petrusich","artist":"The Deadly Snakes","title":"Porcella","text":" If bands could be pieced together at will, with wildly disparate influences snapping into place like lego bricks, every record would sound like a Deadly Snakes album. Expertly fusing classic rock, soul, blues, lofi, and punk into one throbbing machine, the Snakes mishmash aesthetic inadvertently landed them in garage rock bins across the globe, rubbing stickers with the Hives and the Dirtbombs, shaking off the Standells and the Nuggets box, trying their best to reinvent the scrapheap in a postBeck universe.Porcella, the band's fourth fulllength since their Toronto inception nearly a decade ago, is a funhouse, all warped mirrors and sliding floors, mellotron gurgles and trumpet hoots, too sinister to giggle away, too compelling to ignore. Much has already been made of the Deadly Snakes' selfproclaimed departure from their garagerock roots but it turns out contemporary genre distinctions are actually just slippery (or meaningless) enough that the labels the Snakes are now so desperate to eschew (unlike the majority of garage revivalists, the Deadly Snakes are sophisticated songwriters and astute players) never really applied to them anyway. Consequently, Porcella is the next logical step in the Snakes' careful evolution dark, slinking, and packed with revelations.Porcella jerks from countryblues throwdowns with \"Jeeeesus loves me!\" lyrics and typewriter drums (the semiridiculous \"Let It All Go\") to classic Snakes soultomfoolery (the freewheeling, honkheavy \"Sissy Blues\"), but never pauses for reflection or righteousness. Porcella may not be as explicitly \"garage\" as the band's previous records, but it still delivers the same beautiful, scrappy mess. Produced by vocalist/multiinstrumentalist Age of Danger (aka Max McCabe), Porcella sees Danger and Andre Ethier trading microphone duties, which provides interesting texture even if Ethier is the more interesting of the two. Mostly, Porcella is at its best when it's at its creepiest: \"High Prices Going Down\" opens with clanking metal (think chain gangs) and a loping bassline, before Ethier starts to wail: \"I read the news and I heard it said/ There's 200 already dead/ High prices going down/ And the king gave up his crown/ High prices are going down/ My mind was abuzz like a swarm of bees/ And I did just as I pleased.\" Ethier's throaty, desperate howls bounce off smarmy mellotron, while the grim details of his looting grow more and more topical. \"High Prices\" is followed by single \"Gore Veil\", a wisp of a song that delivers despite itself, all goofy badababas and trumpet exaltations. It's a strange juxtaposition, but that's what Porcella is all about: laying the laughable alongside the profound. The Deadly Snakes may be incessantly compared to the Kingsmen and the Kinks, but Porcella, like all of their records, packs a healthy dose of Dylan, too particularly the band's penchant for dark, awkward poetry and seizureinducing blowouts, often showcased in the very same song.
