{"label":" Hydra Head","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/17656/homepage_large.6e90ebb0.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brandon Stosuy","artist":"Split Cranium","title":"Split Cranium","text":" Jussi Lehtisalo of Finnish avantnoise/metal/psych shapeshifters Circle, Pharaoh Overlord, and a thousand other projects was working on \"artsyfartsy freenoiserock improvisations\" with drummer Jukka Kroger (FM2000) when they decided to take a few steps back, simplify, and plow through a set of straightahead punk. Around that time, in November 2009, Circle were playing shows with Isis as part of the L.A.viaBoston postmetal band's final European tour; during this span of gigs Lehtisalo and Isis vocalist/guitarist Aaron Turner talked about starting a band. Samae Koskinen from one of Lehtisalo's projects Steel Mammoth joined the fold as bassist, and Split Cranium was born. Even if you weren't aware of the origin tale, it would still be impossible to judge the quartet's selftitled debut as a straightup collection of crust punk. Turner and Lehtisalo are both known for stretching and imploding genres, and as you might expect, this eightsong, 25minute Kurt Ballouproduced \"LP\" isn't a spattering of your typical dbeat. We get three songs under two minutes and a few others only slightly longer, but we also get a layered eightminute \"postcrust\" closer, the tellingly titled \"Retrace the Circle\", that goes out with a batch of meditative incanting and howling set to lockedin drums and feedback. It's as much heady, restive psychedelia as it is a punk rager. There's that, but even when they're not pushing durational extremes, the band manages to incorporate unexpected twists: We get a straightup ZZ Top \"Legs\" lick on \"Tiny Me\", Gregorian chants on \"Yellow Mountain\", ominous throat singing on \"Blossoms from Boils\", and more than a minute of Metal Machine Music on the brief anthem \"Black Binding Plague\", and, in the digital version, a remix of \"Sceptres to Rust\" by Portlandbased electroacoustic tweaker Daniel Menche. And Turner has more control and variation in his howls than most folks in this situation, giving Disfear's Tomas Lindberg a run for his money in the raw shredding, but also going for those clean, uplifting harmonies. Not that this is an experimental record: Those details surface alongside very catchy, speedy punk riffs (which are stellar throughout), chantalong group vocals, and rolling drums. It's oldschool in spirit, newschool in execution. A colleague of mine referred to the various unexpected bits as \"MotorheadviaHawkwind territory.\" That makes a lot of sense, especially considering Lemmy's work in the two groups, and how hindsight offers overlaps for creative listeners. In that spirit, it's hard not to find Isislike details here, to smile at a meta title like \"Retrace the Circle\". And, sure, when you have someone as high profile as Aaron Turner giving a go at \"underground\" crust, you're bound to get scene kids on the defensive. The thing is, Turner also gave an honest go at black metal in the super group Twilight, handles experimental ambiance with his wife, pianist and artist Faith Coloccia, as Mamiffer, drifts into dark ambient/drone with House of Low Culture, and runs two labels, Hydra Head and Mamiffer's imprint, SIGE. What we have here is a restless artist and mind, not an opportunist, and I think that spirit is part of what makes Split Cranium work as well as it does. And, fuck, on a more basic level, it's hard to be cynical when you're pumping your fist along to this stuff. "}
