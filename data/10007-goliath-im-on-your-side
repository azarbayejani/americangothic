{"label":" Broken Sparrow","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/9822/homepage_large.7b5b93af.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Dahlen","artist":"Hotel Alexis","title":"Goliath, I'm On Your Side","text":"  In the middle of Goliath, I'm On Your Side comes a moment that colors the entire record except it's not so much one moment as a handful of them that stretch over 18 minutes. \"Hummingbird/Indian Dog\" consists of soft guitar, loops, and drones that shimmer and rise to the sky, a mostlywordless dreamspace made of the gentlest psychedelia. Once you hear it, it stays with you every time you play the record in the sturdier altcountry of \"The Devil Knows My Handle\", or the fragile ballads like \"Suddenly, It's You & Me\" where every instrument and every timbre in Syd Alexis' voice reveal cracks. This is one of those indie albums, a lateatnight, ostensibly vulnerable singersongwriter thing where the auteur's friends step in to flesh out those simple arrangements with all the right touches a Mellotron here, pedal steel there. The rhythm section of Kimberlee Torres and Gregg Porter, Nathan Groth on guitar and vibes, and guests like Say Zuzu's Jon Nolan provide a fragile backdrop like the melody of \"Silver Waves Crash Through the Canyons\" that takes off on papermach√© wings, or opener \"Sad, Sad Army\", where Alexis' vocals open in a nightshift croak. But this isn't an album that coasts on its vibe. The dreaminess sometimes takes its toll: for some this will be a soft listen, maybe softer than the songs call for. The mellifluous synths of \"I Will Arrange For You To Fall II\" cradle you maternally, and a lullaby tone creeps in repeatedly. But the sublime state they achieve makes up for it. Two shorter instrumentals the brief \"Thicket\" and \"Oh, The Loneliness\" feed the ambiance of \"Hummingbird/Indian Dog\", and together they give Alexis and gang a chance to set on tape the space rock field trips of their live shows. The songs are strong on their own, but these excursions give Hotel Alexis a chance to disappear into a dream for a while, and find out where it leads. "}
