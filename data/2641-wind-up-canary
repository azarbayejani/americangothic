Deusner","artist":"Casey Dienel","title":"Wind-Up Canary","text":" Accentuated with striking vocals and whimsically sophisticated lyrics, Massachusetts native Casey Dienel's blend of cabaret, jazz, folk, and pop places her squarely in the eccentricwomenwithpiano pop camp, which is much more fertile territory these days than eccentricwomanwithacousticguitar or eccentricguywithpiano pop. WindUp Canary features mainly Dienel and her piano, with the occasional accompaniment of crash cymbals, a charmingly rickety drum kit, and a jazz banjo. Her songs show traces of Nellie McKay's subversive formalism, Regina Spektor's bizarro cabaret, and Tori Amos's sweeping scope, but Dienel could be just as easily and fruitfully compared to those outside her camp to the Decemberists or Clem Snide or to literary types like George Saunders and Z.Z. Packer, whose short stories share an oddball sensibility and heartrent humor with Dienel's story songs. Like most writers, Dienel has her pet topics, first and foremost herself. \"Everything\" is a snappy birthof theartist tale (\"When I was only four I found my lonely ivories and we became fast friends\"), and \"Cabin Fever\" recalls her move from her small, seaside Massachusetts hometown to Boston a looming milestone in her young life. \"Tundra\" shouts out to JoAnn Fabrics (an indie first?) and erects a complex metaphor involving the Weather Channel and a broken relationship. The 1960s also feature prominently on WindUp Canary, although not in terms of the counterculture so much as the Establishment. Stylistically, she slyly alludes to bossa nova and exotica rhythms without overtly incorporating them, and she deconstructs and rebuilds 60s pop mythology to geewhiz glee. \"Frankie and Annette\" reimagines the Mouseketeers as smalltime outlaws, pitiable in their poverty, and on the opener, \"Doctor Monroe\", Dienel sings about an Everyman who chainsmokes, reads Playboy, drinks highballs. But soon the fa√ßade crumbles, and he begins dressing up in his wife Helen's clothes and \"speaking to the sixth dimensions through public urinals.\" Dienel marries this hardluck tale to her most playful verse melody and her most impassioned chorus, half in awe of the man's savoir faire and half disgusted by his lack of selfexamination. It's her best song her \"Joan Jett of Arc\", her \"Sea Oak\". As \"Doctor Monroe\" shows and \"Tundra\", and \"The Coffee Beanery\" Dienel's at her best when she's at her weirdest, and oddly she's at her weirdest when she's at her catchiest, because nothing sells a peculiar daydream as persuasively as an infectious hook. Flirting with preciousness but never going all the way, Dienel always sounds confident in her quirkiness, blissfully unaware that her melodies aren't always strong enough to warrant such selfassuredness or that her lyrics sometimes sound like clever nonsense. But who needs melodies when you've got real songs, or sensible lyrics when you've got so much personality? "}
