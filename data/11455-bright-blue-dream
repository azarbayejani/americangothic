{"label":" Autobus","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/11223/homepage_large.fcefbfec.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"{{{ Sunset }}}","title":"Bright Blue Dream","text":"  I first heard Austin's Sound Team some six or seven years ago, back when I wrote for an online demo review column. They were kind of dilapidated and sloppy, but I liked them for it, and not just because they didn't sound like the same numetal or halfassed Lookout! punk or cheap Sunny Day Real Estate knockoff crap I usually reviewed. I got this great lofi psych vibe out of them that proved to be hard to define, exactly, except in terms of atmosphere: sort of logey, kind of humid, with a great deal of heavy, clanky fuckaroundery. Over the next few years I found some lowkey joy in their 2004 cassetteonly release Yes, then more or less lost track of them despite their relatively highprofile signing to Capitol and the release of their 2006 major label debut Movie Monster. Maybe I should've paid a bit more attention before they broke up: any band that responds to a Pitchfork pan with a video attempting to depict Marc Hogan's thumbsdown in the most literal terms possible has to have something going for 'em somewhere. After founder and multiinstrumentalist Bill Baird went from the defunct Sound Team to his own project as {{{Sunset}}}, the PR guy for Autobus offered to send me a few CDs of his, as well as a cassette. After accepting the CDs but mentioning that I didn't actually have a working cassette player anymore, they actually spent $12 on postage to send me a beatup tape deck. All that weirdlyguided effort and oddball behavior really makes me wish I liked this CD a lot more than I do. Considering that the two Bill Baird solo/proto{{{Sunset}}} CDs I got in that tape deck package held a lot of promise they were unrepentantly strange and darkly funny in a way that reminded me of Beck if Mellow Gold tanked and he never met the Dust Brothers, deciding instead to keep going on the Stereopathetic Soulmanure path Bright Blue Dream is surprisingly short on ideas, even if the atmosphere almost makes up for it. The compromise between lofi aesthetics and Spiritualizedlevel grandiosity works fairly well, and the album's first half is workable enough as a mixed bag of shoegazepop fundamentals. While \"I Love My Job\" is a speedbump the firstdraft Spoon piano and obvious officewoe lyrics make it catchy but not much else the eerie chiming whirr of opener \"Dear Broken Friend\" and the evocative new wave/synthpsych \"Diamond Studded Caskets\" are legitimately beautiful in a disconnected and illfitting sort of way. Even if it comes too close to a polished, hypnotic tautness for the sloppy edges to be excusable, the sound on Bright Blue Dream has some appeal when driving percussive compositions are run through it. It's the ambient, overlong second half that drags things down. The simple structure of \"Moebius\" vaguely works because capping off its leaningonasynth hum with a crescendo of keening guitar is pretty much the only logical way to end a song like that on an album like this, but \"Golden Reverie\" a drumfree, pianodriven melodic piece augmented by mysterious effects pedal/wornout Mellotron debris is three minutes' worth of prettiness stretched out to five and a half minutes' worth of repetition. The downpitched, dyingbattery banjoandhandclap bluegrass of \"Old Sandy Bull Lee\" is evocatively ramshackle, but the twominute whining keyboard coda sounds less like an ascent into some higher plane of freakfolk and more like things just petering out. And the endless drone of \"Bright Blue Dream\" is Eno without a point: when listening to the 14plusminute title cut leaves me with the same impression as a sevensecond transitional track, something ain't right. Like the (apparently optional) curly brackets around Sunset's name, the bloat around this album makes a perfectly accessible core into a bewildering mess even if, more often than not, it's also a compelling mess.
