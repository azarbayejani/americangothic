{"label":" Tizona","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13914/homepage_large.deb5e6dc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Klein","artist":"D. Rider","title":"Mother of Curses","text":" The ignominious sweeping of U.S. Maple into the dustbin was a downright tragedy. At its best, the group worked like AC/DC remixed by Pablo Picasso, thrillingly offkilter cubistrock that rearranged itself in real time. At its worst, well, at least the band never stopped trying to keep people on their toes.Regardless, the past is the past, and U.S. Maple guitarist Todd Rittman has moved on, and on again, first with Singer, a sortof supergroup (for those with low supergroup standards) featuring members of 90 Day Men and Town and Country, and now with D. Rider, a no less (but no more) supergroup teaming Rittman with CheerAccident's keyboardist/cornet player Andrea Faught and Mucca Pazza reedist Noah Tabakin.\"Make no mistake,\" warns the press notes. \"This is not arthouse studio meanderings. This is a rock record.\" Actually, it's a little of both. Any disc that enlists scribbling magic marker as an instrument definitely passes the \"arthouse studio meanderings\" test, but at the same time, that track, \"Arranged Marriage to No Toms\", does indeed rock, sort of. It's the best of both worlds for eggheads and bobbing heads alike. The dirgy \"Dew Claw Don't Claw\" rocks, too (sort of), its weird menace leading up to a guitar antisolo that sounds a little like a modem locked in mortal battle with a dentist's drill (we'll call it a draw).\"Body to Body (to Body)\" is no less abrasive in its deconstructionist instincts, constantly turning in on itself while stuttered along a fitfully funky groove. While \"Welcome Out\" at first seems to be offering an acoustic guitar respite, finding some shared vision between jazz and folk. But then the deceptively stirring song leads to what could be its electric companion piece \"Dear Blocks\", this one introduced by the sound of a spray paint can being shaken and discharged before sinewy guitars and oddlyaccented drums lock in with one another, synths begin to squelch, horns bleat, and the track peters out anticlimatically.The same thing happens with \"Misery Whip\", which does a disservice to its awesome title and primordial riff, and really that's the problem with a lot of Mother of Curses. Too often, D. Rider sound (sometimes literally) like a scratch pad, like they're still working out where they wants to go even as the tape rolls. The music here is intriguing, sometimes mysterious, and does often rock. Or, at least, sort of rock, a little like U.S. Maple did, by trying to redefine what rocking even means. Yet even the most promising grooves, like \"Touchy\" or the jarring \"Marksman\", go nowhere in the end. Crafting arthouse meanderings that rock turns out to be the easy part. It's sticking the landing that's hard, and no matter how much D. Rider twists, turns and tumbles in midair, they're just not there yet. "}
