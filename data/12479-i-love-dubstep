Maybe it's because the genre's most exciting developments this year were the revelation of Burial's identity and the rise of offshoot genres like funky and wonky, meant largely to combat the stagnancy of a scene left to a war of darkerandharder attrition. Still, Americans whose interest was piqued by Untrue deserve to have a few more names to put into their Rolodex, and a hitpacked mix CD is, if anything, at least a solid gateway towards a muchneeded bit of genredefining perspective.That's why I Love Dubstep, a wellcurated twoman mix courtesy of the pioneering pirate station Rinse FM is a good bet for new listeners interested in the bigger dubstep picture even if it's already sounding a little more like timecapsule material than the way forward. The DJs selected for this collection have plenty of bonafides: Youngsta is an early dubstep adopter who spun scenedefiner tracks on the regular before he could legally buy a pint; Geeneus, meanwhile, has a production career that runs the gamut from early grime to current UK funky club hits. And, fortunately, they both have different approaches to their mixes, both in selection and mood.Youngsta's disc has a consistent mood, characterized by waves of growling, fluttering bass. About onethird of his mix's 23 tracks are credited either to Skream or Benga, two of the Croydonbased foundationbuilders who fortified the booming, wobblybassline style that ubiquitous imitation has threatened to dilute. Those signifiers stand out a bit more brightly when these two are involved: Skream's almost lighthearted, skainfused touch on \"Dutch Flowerz\" and Benga's energyflashing raver flashback \"Flames\" toy with expanding the parameters of the sound, while the consecutive 12 punch of Skream's \"Midnight Request Line\" mixed into Benga's \"26 Basslines\" prove the secret to dubstep's appeal lies as much in jittery, restless, sometimes hyperactive (and danceable) rhythms as it does in \"dark\" atmospheric gloominess.There are still a few watertreading, semionimous halfstep shrugs that might've sounded more revolutionary in 2006 Caspa's \"Rubber Chicken\"; Pinch's \"Punisher\"; SP MC's \"Trust Nobody\" (which has the added disadvantage of being released in 2008). But in the context of this mix and thrown in with genuinely different cuts like Hijak's rootsdub throwback \"Dally\" and the euphoric closer of halfwaytohardcore D1 cut \"Mind & Soul\" (billed under its original title, \"Give It Back\") they manage to sustain the first disc's evocative mood of intense darkness punctuated by flashes of neon.Geeneus plays things differently, and a bit more intriguingly: His disc has a keener focus on rhythmic elasticity than big heavy slabs of bass. There's still plenty of subwoofer fodder, of course the Bug's towering \"Skeng\", the dense buzzpulse of Distance's \"V\", and some additional tracks from Skream (\"Oskillatah\"; \"Make Me\"; \"2D\") and Benga (\"E Trips\"; Benga & Coki's \"Night\") see to that. But Geeneus' selection has a lot more breathing room, with sprightlier drums and a heavier emphasis on vocal tracks to cut through the shadows. There are more vivid nods to dubstep's origins in UK garage, best personified by Martyn's breathtaking DCM Remix of TRG's \"Broken Heart\". And it hews closer to its Jamaican roots, whether in titular invocations of Rastafarianism (Kode9's \"Babylon\"; Digital Mystikz cut \"Give Jah Glory\"), dancehall vocals (\"Skeng\"; Coki's remix of Richie Spice's \"Burning\"), and straightup classic skanking riddims (Conquest's \"Hardfood\"; the Digital Mystikz remix of Fat Freddy's Drop's \"Cay's Crays\"). I Love Dubstep doesn't do a lot to point towards the scene's future, but its presentation of two different facets ofÂ  the scene dark and bright, dense and loose, brooding and danceable proves there's at least more than one way to get there.
