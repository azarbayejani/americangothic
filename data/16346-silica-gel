{"label":" self-released","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/17510/homepage_large.6713fa99.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nick Neyland","artist":"Bodyguard","title":"Silica Gel","text":" James Ferraro can talk a good (or at least entertaining) game. \"As I write this, Dr. Conrad Murray has just been indicted for the manslaughter of Michael Jackson, history's biggest pop star,\" he wrote, in an email exchange with the Quietus in 2011. \"And I wanna write a fiction inspired by these events. And I've already got the soundtrack floating in my head: MELODIES OF TENSION, SHAME, DARKNESS AND SECRECY.\" In a recent interview with the Stool Pigeon, he talked up Lana Del Rey's shaky SNL appearance, calling it \"a high point in our civilization right now.\" After tooling away in the noise underground for years, the modicum of exposure afforded to Ferraro via the acclaim for Far Side Virtual has given him a platform, and his calloused fingers are hammering away at his touchscreen (a bootleg Android phone, natch, as per the Quietus interview) in an attempt to maintain our digital gazes. \"VAPORS N 1 HOUR,\" he yelped on Twitter, just prior to delivering this free mixtape under his new Bodyguard moniker. This is a quickie followup to the similarly released Inhale C4 $$$$$ under Ferraro's Bebetune$ name, thankfully dropping much of the hiphop inspired material pockmarked throughout that release. Instead, we get Bodyguard, apparently the name of a band Ferraro has formed, who mostly trade in allcaps track titles with occasional hashtags and underscores thrown in (\"#FLAMETHROWER\", \"Ice_Cut_Digital\"). It continues Ferraro's preference for spewing digital debris all over his work, a feeling akin to piling up a dumpster with Tumblr detritus and funneling it into song. Much of it bears the same kind of offthe cuff, hitapresetandgo feel of his most recent work, with sets of tinny loops curling around one another, occasionally edging toward the eightminute mark. Silica Gel is a longass grind for the Ritalinaddled audience Ferraro is courting, with the combined runtime just over the onehour mark. But at least there are a few threads of inspiration to cling onto on here, which sets it apart from the deadzone drudgery of Inhale C4 $$$$$. The opening \"H.U.M2.E.R.\" makes it feel like this might simply be more of the same, with a Rihanna sample clumsily poking through the glitchy gunk. But that proves to be a false start to an uneven mixtape, which lacks the conceptual weight that hooked people into Far Side Virtual. Instead, this feels like a loose collection of ideas Ferraro had hanging around his hard drive. Occasionally it's pretty, on the yapping dog groove of \"ECIG\", or in the gently oscillating pulse that lopes through \"Ice_Cut_Digital\". At other times there's a towering build of maximal fury (\"#ACIDRAIN\"), a limp dip into malfunctioning R&B (\"RAIDEN  BLUE LIGHTS # NZT  48\"), and plenty of attempts at assimilating the feeling of staring into a cracked iPhone screen while crunching a disgarded Nintendo 3DS underfoot (\"SEX TAPE\", \"BLACK AND RED\", \"BLOOD TYPE : 5 HOUR ENERGY\"). It looks like Ferraro will spend a decent portion of this year with Bodyguard. Live shows and a debut album are promised for the summer. If that's the case, he would be wise to flesh out the concept a little, which is the central problem with this mixtape. After being so assured in his vision, Silica Gel is Ferraro spinning his wheels, occasionally finding flashes of inspiration, but mostly chasing his own (animated .gif) tail. In his review of Inhale C4 $$$$$, Pitchfork's Brandon Soderberg talked about Far Side Virtual being criticproof, partially because negative reviews could be dismissed as listeners' not getting the joke. But there's some truth in the saying that a good joke never needs explaining, and in interviews it sometimes feels like Ferraro is falling over himself in an attempt to get his point across, albeit in an entertaining and highly readable manner. Here, there doesn't even seem to be a point. Which, considering his track record, may well be the point. "}
