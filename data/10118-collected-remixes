{"label":" Anticon","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/9931/homepage_large.a7a6b67e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Alias","title":"Collected Remixes","text":"  Anticon beatsmith Brendon Whitney, aka Alias, has tapped a broad array of artists to fill out his Collected Remixes. Styles include the One AM Radio's indie rock, John Vanderslices's folky soundscapes, Giardini Di Miro's postrock, Lali Puna's electropop, 13 & God's abstract hiphop, and the IDM of Christ. Given this diverse list of collaborators, you might expect equally diverse results. That the album is in fact so uniform, playing like an Alias solo effort that pales in comparison to last year's collaboration with vocalist Tarsier, highlights his weaknesses as a producer. As remixers go, Alias most resembles a juicer no matter what you put in, the same homogeneous goop comes out. And \"goop\" isn't necessarily as negative as it sounds; it simply alludes to the sneaking suspicion that Alias isn't thinking about the possibilities inherent in the songs he's remixing, only processing them into his own nonspecific instrumental hiphop, which tends to linger just this side of tedium. Still, the results can be tasty or not according to what goes into the blender. The swooning vocals of the One AM Radio's \"What You Gave Away\" nestle prettily amid sputtering drums and snowy chimes. Lali Puna's \"Alienation\" sounds fine chopped up into clipclopping percussion and livewire synths. And Sixtoo's \"Karmic Retribution/Funny Sticks\" at least provides some contrast with its chaotic squalls of noise. Bum ingredients sour other passable concoctions: Why? appears on the remix of 13 & God's \"Into the Trees\" and John Vanderslice appears on the remix of his \"Exodus Damage\" (duh); both singers have reedy, almost bracing voices that aren't wellsuited to Alias's supasmoove night moves.  The main problem with the album is that the bulk of it is virtually indistinguishable. Alias fashions Lunz's \"Clue\" into a skittering, midtempo synth glide, reworks Lucky Pierre's \"Crush\" into a skittering, midtempo synth glide, and then, just to shake things up, turns Giardini Di Miro's \"Given Ground\" into a skittering, midtempo synth glide. If you're going to be a onetrick pony, it had better be a really good trick. Alias's isn't bad, just severely limited and predictable, seeming always to conjure the same glacial atmosphere with the same sound palette and the same lowkey dynamics. Any of these on their own might impress, but collected together, they blur into anonymity, lacking the diversity or the nuance necessary to uphold the weight of the album format.  "}
