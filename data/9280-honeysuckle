{"label":" Unknown","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/9116/homepage_large.d77a0510.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Adam Moerder","artist":"Klee","title":"Honeysuckle","text":" When foreign films first crash onto American shores, they often flummox us slackjawed, mouthbreathin' Yanks. We like our innings three outs long, our pies made with apple, and our indie rock easily categorized into readymade labels like \"postpunk\" or \"freakfolk.\" However, in the same manner Almod√≥var can mash up comedy, drama, romance, and magic realism into a feasible feature film, German pop group Klee acts like they've never seen the genre dividers on a Tower Records CD rack. While practically any throwaway tag fits the group, the trio's first stateside release stands for, above anything else, effete pop, no matter what accessorized genre it's grafted on. That's not to say Honeysuckle's a triumph in genrebending. Far from it. Instead, the band parlays Suzie Kerstgens' versatile voice into an album varied enough to draw attention away from otherwise humdrum craftsmanship. Kerstgens, an Annie/Amy Millan/Gustav hybrid, hedges her mostly guttural German lyrics with a breathy delivery, allowing her to toy with emo, twee, shoegaze, and electropop interchangeably. Providing a fluid backdrop, the rest of the band shows off their cosmopolitan tastes with hints of the Cure, New Order, Stars, and My Bloody Valentine, albeit backhandedly. On a cynical level, Honeysuckle seems to serve merely as a vehicle for uberhip dance single \"Gold\". The song appears twice on the tracklist, both in English and German versions, and it's the album's only true new wave cut among a throng of sleepyeyed, atmospheric pop numbers. Of course, when the song's prickly reverb riffs outmuscle the rest of the album's guitar parts combined, the favoritism makes sense. Too much of Honeysuckle lollygags through bucolic scenery reminiscent of today's postBritpop guitar bands. While songs like \"Two Questions\" and \"With You\" contain enough provocative ideas to gather no moss, the album opens and closes with a spattering of shapeless dream pop, bloated to the gills with jangly guitar and plastic strings. Perhaps the best solution to Klee's ecoheavy sound lies in the urban sprawl of Honeysuckle's few electronic numbers. \"Two Questions\" and \"As Long As You Live\" sport compact electro hooks while not sounding entirely unctuous to slapdash dancerock. \"Not Even Ten Horses\" veers into Pixies territory with its melodic, chargedup bassline and \"Gigantic\" singsong vocals. For all the praise \"Gold\" garnered with stoic instrumentation and Kerstgens's icequeen delivery, it's baffling how often Honeysuckle thaws out this sound rather than locking in on it. Hopefully with a little selfassessment, Klee will render themselves a prize import, a specialized cash crop rather than random livestock feed. "}
