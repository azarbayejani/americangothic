From the start, Bachmann's longstanding, personnelshifting, Americanaimbued second act's traded in a kind of weary reflection, but Breaks in the Armor's brooding gaze mostly seems to be directed backward; at times, Bachmann almost seems to be addressing his younger self. The album finds him channeling hardfought lessons into 11 remorsetinged tunes with the weight of the world on their shoulders, the years caught in his battlescarred throat. Laid down with Pixies' live sound engineer Matt Yelton with little other outside assistance beyond backing vocals from frequent Crooked Fingers collaborator Liz Durrett Breaks' homespun sound is solemn and spacious, opting for subtle coloring and economy of gesture. Breaks places the spotlight squarely on Bachmann's voice as it wearily recounts a series of past indignities; \"the ghosts,\" as he puts it on opener \"Typhoon\", \"of all your old forgotten lows.\" Bachmann's feeling more than a little low on Breaks in the Armor, and he wants you to know it. On lines like, \"I draw the same bad blood out of you,\" from the piercing \"Bad Blood\", he seems to want you to share in it, too. Easy enough. You don't need to hear Bachmann sigh his way through highlight \"Heavy Hours\" to know he's been through plenty of them himself; his rich, roughshod voice suggests as much on every line. With a master's restraint, he imparts an almost apocalyptic dread to the ominous refrain of \"Black Candles\", a deadserious desperation on the searching \"Went to the City\", a real finality to faretheewell \"The Hatchet\". Breaks' lyrical thumbnails of lost opportunities and forgotten friends can seem a touch too pathosaddled on paper, but drawn through Bachmann's lungs, they leave their mark. While a few hints of light eke through Breaks' dark surface, it's a somber affair, and Bachmann's dour outlook can sometimes drag his melodies down with him; as much weight as his voice can carry on its own, a few of these tunes dial the music back so far that you're left with little else but ache. But even when Bachmann lays things out too bare, he'll slip scores of feeling into a line or two, leaving the listener with no doubt as to precisely which nerve he's intending to strike. \"Much too much for us to turn back now,\" the guy who once screamed, \"you've got it all wrong,\" sighs on \"War Horses\", the regret in his voice never far from the surface.
