Two years ago, when Brooklynites Stellastarr* turned up fresh out of art school in the wake of Interpol's Turn On The Bright Lights, the foursome seemed considerably less like copycats and more like the lesser of two partnersincrime ripping off New Wave big names. Both debuts resembled soundtracks to somber dance parties, but Stellastarr*'s had crappier lyrics, and Amanda Tannen's sweet hollabacks. So Harmonies for the Haunted is nothing new; it'd be easy enough to nail the band for repeat offense of poorman doubling. But they're firstrate mocks as deft as deadon cover bands come. Virtually all the LP's tracks flaunt role models plainly, but they draw from even fewer sources this time around. \"Lost in Time\" already plays uncannily reminiscent of the Cure's \"Closedown\". \"Sweet Troubled Soul\" is Bloc Party's \"Helicopter\" for drama kings who fancy their queens sweet and troubled \"I want to suffer in your arms/ And when you're naked in the dark/ I want to see your face in the reflection of my bedroom stereo/ We'll take it slow.\" No room for jokester Kinks shit here especially since Christensen's pipes are Ric Ocasek's gone through two extra rounds of puberty. Bitter singles going doortodoor caroling on Valentine's day would sound something like \"Damn This Foolish Heart\" dissolving into earnest rounds, all while Christensen's crying \"no no no no.\" Speaking of histrionics: \"Love and Longing\" and \"When I Disappear\" channel the AllAmerican Rejects picture lead singers' eyes closed, belting \"I won't regret you.\" Christensen's puppy dog wails seem as recycled as the music itself. Even the Rejects camouflaged better. But Harmonies kinda seduces, anyway; \"Lost in Time\" sheds some light on why: \"I tried to say/ I miss you tonight/ And they claim you've already died/ But the truth is that we're lost in time.\" Here's a P.S./Birthtype setup: Mostlydead lovers getting uncannily resurrected as sweeter, younger things, but way less metaphysical.
