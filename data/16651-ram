This is odd. Usually the reissuepackaging gods demand the positioning of an eager critic between you and the product, dispensing wisdom on how you might experience the music they're standing in front of. What you find instead is a McCartney familyphoto scrapbook: Paul draping himself playfully around monkey bars with his infant Stella. Mary, about three years old, hoisting fat headphones above her tiny head; on the opposite page, Linda nuzzling Paul, those same headphones ringed around his neck. In the photos, Paul looks dazed, as if he were smacked in the face with a pillow seconds before the shutter clicked. It drives the point home: Ram is a domesticbliss album, one of the weirdest, earthiest, and most honest ever made. No wonder critics loathed it so passionately. Or at least, some critics did. Sometimes an album gets a review so resoundingly negative that it lurks forever like a mournful spirit in its rear view mirror: Jon Landau, writing for Rolling Stone, claimed to hear in Ram \"the nadir in the decomposition of Sixties rock thus far.\" Which is intense. But people wanted impossible things from Beatles solo albums closure, healing, apologies, explanations for what to do with their dashed expectations. John Lennon tried telling everyone outright \"The dream is over\" on Plastic Ono Band's \"God\", but that still wasn't a coldwater jet hard enough to prepare people, apparently, for the whimsical pastoral oddity that was Ram. Landau was right, however, that it did spell the end of something, which might be a clue to the vitriol: If \"60s rock\" was defined, in large part, by the existence of the Beatles, then Ram made it clear in a new, and newly painful, way that there would be no Beatles ever again. To use a messydivorce metaphor: When your parents are still screaming redfaced at each other, it's a nightmare, but you can still be assured they care. When one of them picks up and continues on living, it smarts in an entirely different way. Ram, simply put, is the first Paul McCartney release completely devoid of John's musical influence. Of course, John wiggled his way into some of the album's lyrics in those fresh, postbreakup years, the two couldn't quite keep each other out of their music. But musically, Ram proposes an alternate universe where young Paul skipped church the morning of July 6, 1957, and the two never crossed paths. It's breezy, abstracted, completely hallucinogenfree, and utterly lacking grandiose ambitions. Its an album whistled to itself. It's purely Paul. Or actually, \"Paul and Linda.\" This was another one of Paul's chief Ramrelated offenses: He not only invited his new photographer bride into the recording studio, he included her name on the record's spine. Ram is the only album in recorded history credited to the artist duo \"Paul and Linda McCartney,\" and in the sense that Linda's enthusiastically warbling vocals appear on almost every song, it's entirely accurate. Some read Paul's decision as the ultimate insult to his former partner: I've got a new collaborator now! Her name is Linda, and she never makes me feel stupid. In the album's freewheeling spirit, however, the decision scans more like guilelessness and innocence. The songs don't feel collaborative so much as cooperative: little schoolhouse plays that required every hand on deck to get off the ground. Paul had the most talent, so naturally he was up front, but he wanted everyone behind him, banging pots, hollering, whistling whatever it is you did, make sure you're back there doing it with gusto. It is exactly this homemade charm that has caught on with generations of listeners as the initial furor around the album subsided. What 2012's ears can find on Ram is a rock icon inventing an approach to pop music that would eventually become someone else's indie pop. It had no trendy name here; it was just a disappointing Beatles solo album. But when Ben Stiller's fussy, pedantic \"Greenberg\" character painstakingly assembles a mix for Greta Gerwig intended to display the breadth and depth of his popculture appreciation, he slides Ram's \"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\" on there. It's the song we see her singing along to enthusiastically in the following montage. Critics hated \"Uncle Albert\". \"A major annoyance,\" Christgau opined. Again, from the current moment we can only plead ignorance, assume that some serious shit had to be going down to clog everyone's ears. Because \"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\" is not only Ram's centerpiece, it is clearly one of McCartney five greatest solo songs. As the slash in the title hints, it's a multipart song, starring two characters. To put its accomplishments in an eggheaded way: It fuses the conversational joy listeners associated with McCartney's melodic gift to the compositional ambition everyone assumed was Lennon's. To put it a simpler way: Every single second of this song is joyously, deliriously catchy, and no two seconds are the same. Do you think early Of Montreal, the White Stripes at their most vaudevillian, or the Fiery Furnaces took any lessons from this song? What a lot of people thought they heard on \"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\", and everywhere else on the album, is cloying cuteness. But it turns out you can say a lot of things things like \"go fuck yourself\" (\"3 Legs\"), \"everything is fucked\" (\"Too Many People\"), and even \"let's go fuck, honey\" (\"Eat At Home)\" with a big, dimpled grin on your face. \"It's just the critics who say, 'Well, John was the biting tongue; Paul's the sentimental one,'\" Linda observed shrewdly in a dual Playboy interview from 1984. \"John was biting, but he was also sentimental. Paul was sentimental, but he could be very biting. They were more similar than they were different.\" The joy of paying close attention to Ram is gradually discovering that Paul was humming darker things under his breath than it seemed. \"Smile Away\", for instance, is a messy, romping slab of Buddy Holly rock. Paul makes a joke about his stinky feet. The chorus goes \"Smile away, smile away, smile away, smile away, smile away.\" But it's not just \"smile,\" a brief, costfree act that can last a second. It's \"Smile Away\", keeping a fixed grin as conversation grows unpleasant. In interviews of the period, Paul was asked repeatedly if he felt lost without his collaborating partner, if he was motivated solely by commercial success, how he felt about being \"the cute Beatle.\" The backing vocal chant behind \"Smile Away\" goes, by turns, \"Don't know how to do that\" and \"Learning how to do that.\" \"Smile away horribly, now,\" Paul slurs over the song's fadeout. Yes, he's fine. No, he and Linda will not become the next \"John and Yoko.\" But thanks so much for asking. If you tell a dog it's a brainless fleabag with the same tone of voice you use to say \"Good boy,\" it will still wag its tail. The album is riddled with dark grace notes like this: \"Monkberry Moon Delight\" has an absolutely unhinged vocal take, Paul gulping and sobbing right next to your inner ear. The imagery is surrealist, but anything but whimsical: \"When a rattle of rats had awoken/ The sinews, the nerves, and the veins,\" he bellows. It could be a latterday Tom Waits performance. \"Too Many People\" opens with Paul warbling \"piece of cake,\" but the lyrics themselves wag their finger at societal injustices, former bandmates basically everybody. The lyrics to \"3 Legs\" are full of hobbling animals with missing limbs. The almosttitle song \"Ram On\", could serve as the album's redeeming spirit: A haunting, indelible little tune drifts past on ukulele as Paul croons, \"Ram on, give your heart to somebody/ Soon, right away.\" The title is a play on his old stage name \"Paul Ramon,\" which makes the song a private little prayer; a mirror image, perhaps, to John Lennon's \"Hold On\". The song is reprised, late in the record, functioning like a calming breeze. \"I want a horse, I want a sheep/ Want to get me a good night's sleep,\" Paul jauntily sings on \"Heart of the Country\", a city boy's vision of the country if ever there was one, and another clue to the record's mindstate. For Paul, the country isn't just a place where crops grow; it's \"a place where holy people grow.\" Now that American cities everywhere are having their Great Pastoral Moment, full of artisans churning goat'smilk yogurt and canning their own jams, Ram feels like particularly ripe fruit. This reissue comes with a disc of extras from the period, which hardcore McCartney fans will already know well. They are lovely, an extension of the album's mood and world without interrupting it or diluting it. Songs like \"Another Day\" and \"Hey Diddle\" feel like a crackedopen door onto the kind of records Paul could have conceivably gone on making forever. A few years later, he had returned, presumably chastened, to crafting overarching concept records about fictitious bands, the sort of thing he'd gotten a lot of applause for in the past. But the bracingly pure and simple air of Ram has resonated further. "}
