{"label":" Drag City","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/3198/homepage_large.0919408a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Edith Frost","title":"It's a Game","text":" If the \"It's\" in the title of this album refers to relationships and their diverse possible outcomes (which even a cursory listen will reveal to be the case), then Edith Frost is a perennial loser the dice go cold in her hands; she loses a turn; she goes directly to jail. It's difficult to unearth a song here that doesn't find Frost in dire romantic straits not just heartbroken, but plainly pathetic, unabashedly needy. One waits, in vain, for some sort of inner strength or declaration of independence to emerge; instead, personal dignity is sacrificed time and again to the ghost of romantic love.It's a Game, then, is a countryfolk tribute to codependency, one lacking the acerbic wit, unexpected joy, and newfound resolve that elevate such music beyond the maudlin. Instead, it's track after track of selfeffacement and emotional panhandling, seemingly oblivious to the fact that there's a lot more to life than waiting on a man to let you be happy. The pretty confidence of the music Frost has a rich voice and a knack for lilting, breathy acoustica reminiscent of Leslie Feist is constantly at odds with the ugly insecurity of the lyrics. Here's Frost on the plinking \"Emergency\", cajoling a restless lover instead of admitting he's a right bastard and moving on: \"You've got so much time for that other woman/ I don't know why you won't spend your time with me.\" Maybe it's because, as she sings on the saddlesore ballad \"A Mirage\", \"As the last boy I loved told me the day we said goodbye/ My heart is too sentimental and his love he could only deny.\" And \"What's the Use\", while musically spry, is rife with defeated longing: \"What's the use in trying again when you're only going to break my heart/ Where did I go wrong in my thinking you'd fall in love with a girl like me?\"  God. Has Frost ever heard of selffulfilling prophecy? Her selfdegradation is, at best, endearing in spurts, but becomes really frustrating over the course of It's a Game. The smoldering \"My Lover Won't Call\" speaks for itself; \"Larger than Life\" shamelessly wheedles \"Please keep calling me;\" \"Just a Friend\" oozes with unattractive desperation: \"Won't you let me get closer/ Just tell me what I should say/ I don't want it to be over / I don't want this thing to end.\" By the time it's all said and done, you sort of want to shake her by the shoulders; turn her on to \"Since U Been Gone\"; something.
