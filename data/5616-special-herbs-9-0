{"label":" Shaman Work","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/5541/homepage_large.ad8673a5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Peter Macia","artist":"Metal Fingers","title":"Special Herbs 9 + 0","text":" Daniel Dumile, the man behind the metal, whether of Face or Fingers, is one of those artists whose hustle is so ingrained that his releases seem to have less to do with the people's appeasement than with his need to clear mental space. He's prolific to the point where he's often docked points for not letting us forget about him for a minute, yet his output is rarely, if ever, disappointing or boring. To keep it fresh, he sidles up to the zeitgeist to hover over Madlib's cobwebs or paw at Dangermouse's fleet beats with Garfield mumbles. When he can't find a collaborator, he raps about his dinner or changes his costume. All that to say that it's usually his lyrics that are on display or in demand, his production getting less notice because the words are a maze. To remind everyone that he is indeed a formidable producer, Dumile quietly releases a volume of Special Herbs from time to time. Each is a collection of instrumentals, some previouslyreleased backing tracks from his or other's albums, some unreleased beat sketches or standalone compositions. 9 + 0 feels more substantial than previous volumes, though, partially due to the upped quality of the unreleased material, but also because of the conspicuous selection of old tunes. This latest edition starts off with \"Vinca Rosea\" each song is named or renamed after a homeopathic medicine, usually one that soothes the bowels or eases depression an organ(ic) soul bouncer propelled by the mmm's and ohh's of a dusty female vocal loop, followed by the lateDoobieish piano and willowy keyboard line of \"Burdock Root\". Elsewhere, previously unreleased songs \"Bergamont\" and \"Yellow Dock\" prove Doom's taste for shrill brass and woodwind, with horns and clarinets crying all over chopped drums. But it's \"Coca Leaf\", the lone stimulatingly titled song, that makes one wonder how many epics Dumile's got stocked. \"Coca\" is massive. It thunders down with a conflation of resolute gospel chants, a pummeling breakbeat, tumbling organ and piano hammers, and an outraged female vocal sample in an overt calltoarms track without being all \"Jesus Walks\" on you. Hopefully, someone will see the title and do a drug rap over it, but it's so outsized that most rappers would cower. Or possibly, it's being saved for the secretive Ghostface/Doom union? That's the point with these things; they are both career retrospective and future teaser, Doom's chance to show his skills extending endlessly over the timeline. Some instrumentals from past volumes resurfaced on subsequent records, but not all. See how fun Doom is? He's the rap Monty Hall. The real gems on 9 + 0, though, are the classic instrumentals, heretofore unavailable in compact disc or mp3 format. \"Podina\" is \"?\", a very rollerskatey jam from Doom's first postKMD album, Operation Doomsday. The beatboxed victory parade of King Geedorah's \"The Fine Print\" returns on \"Untitled (Meditation)\", and \"I Wonder\", also from Geedorah, extracts Hassan Chop's introspective lyrics, leaving the doleful strings standing in the raixC9 without an umbrella√â or galloshes. However, it's the final \"known\" beat that seals it.  This whole Doom, Viktor, Metal, King saga began with two brothers and a kid with a killer hightop fade. Back then, it was Zev Love X, DJ Subroc, and Onyx The Birthstone Kid. It was the scrawny Dumile brothers in kufis and the tall, smooth dude, kicking it to girls over a card table covered in essential oils and incense. Riding bikes in the neighborhood, Subroc sitting on the handlebars and Serch carving shit in his hair in one of the classic videos of early \"Yo!MTV\", Fab 5 early. I've listened to \"Peachfuzz\" from KMD's debut Mr. Hood literally 8 billion times, and I've listened to the instrumental \"Peach Extract\" a million more. It's inclusion here feels like closure, like Daniel Dumile is cool with it being out there, remembering it. Maybe it's not that big of a deal. Maybe it's just one of my favorite songs, and I like trying to remember all the lyrics. Regardless, it's here, and that's good. "}
