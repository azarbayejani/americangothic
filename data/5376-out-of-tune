Yes, I'll explain: Once upon a time, there was Steve Martin, a man with a plan to make us all laugh. His preferred method of inducing laughter was absurdity, doing his \"Ramblin' Man\" thang for a while before finally finding a shortcut called \"Excuuuuuuse me!\" You kids these days may not know it, but if you said those two words just right, the whole wide world of 1976 was on their knees, suffocating with laughter. Continuing his domination by laughter, Martin did a few movies, most notably \"The Jerk,\" one of the finest feature films of all time. Public opinion on \"Just how funny is this Steve Martin guy, anyhow?\" took a downslide once the '80s began. His movies remained true to his desire to be Mr. Absurd (\"The Man With Two Brains\" probably being the apex of the truly hilarious/ nobody cares period), until finally he began to shift gears... crashing head on into a 1986 mess called \"The Three Amigos.\" A horrible, unfunny film, Martin nonetheless recovered just a year later with \"Roxanne\" and one of his finest works, \"Planes Trains and Automobiles.\" Do you see where I'm going with this? Oh, wait. I haven't even gotten there. Martin went right into the toilet shortly thereafter, trying to first become more sitcom friendly (\"Houseguest\"), then semi dramatic (\"Leap of Faith\"), until he released a movie that nobody went to see called \"A Simple Twist of Fate.\" Released in 1993, this was a seriously tragic and poorly done flick about a man and his pet orphan who, if you can imagine, becomes the focus of a nasty custody dispute. When I first heard about this \"Fate\" bullshit, I thought it was a joke. Catching a few minutes of it a couple of weeks back, I was stunned. Here was a man who used to be in sync with that white noise comedy Robin Williams also excelled at. And, by the way, look at the unfortunate high grosses for \"Patch Adams.\" Williams can at least laugh all the way to the bank with his betrayal of funny. Martin had to flop yet again with \"The Out of Towners,\" but not before he did the also not too funny \"Sgt. Bilko.\" Oh, yeah. Mojave 3. Three of these kids used to be in a band called Slowdive. Slowdive was to shoegazing what Steve Martin was to funny circa 1979. Slowdive wasn't more complex than their notorious peers, My Bloody Valentine, and they weren't as drunk as Ride, but they sure did make some purdy rekkids. Of course, they had to eventually blow off what they were good at to make their own \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" an unfortunate album called Ask Me Tomorrow. And in their desire to be taken seriously, they cast off what made 'em so goddamned good in the first place.Out of Tune isn't a step back into Slowdive mode, but it is a much more winsome affair than Tomorrow. I had more hopes just based on the cover alone. (If there are any of those giant Eurpoean subway posters for this floating around, I have a wall in dire need of beauty.) Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell sing a little differently than back in the day, going aurally naked (sans a zillion effects) and stepping out into the SoCal pot happy sunshine folk rock thing they're doing now. No, it doesn't sound like the Eagles, but a few cuts remind me of that godawful shit Ethan Hawke got to sing. Okay, not really, but somewhere Ethan Hawke is just popping a boner because someone mentioned his name in the press again. So, what do I think overall? It's not as meaty as it could be. Whereas Slowdive's lyrics were more enigmatic (or maybe appeared to be through a fog of tremelo), Mojave 3 goes for those bold statements that annoy me. Check these songs titles: \"Who Do You Love\" (no, not that one), \"Some Kinda Angel\" (where Goswell conjures up some Stevie Nicks mojo), \"All Your Tears,\" \"Baby's Coming Home...\" you get the idea. Lots of acoustic guitars, organ, some pedal steel, and harmonies make this a pleasant enough sort of listen as long as I take a bong hit and stare at the cover. Or, to boil it all down into one sentence, this could very well be the first 4AD album to be fully embraced by both AAA radio stations and your mom. File it somewhere between \"Housesitter\" and \"Father of the Bride.\"Post Review Note: I just got back from Cellophane Square music store on University Avenue in Seattle, and I guess I should mention that, according to a Mojave 3 display, a clerk named Karrie really digs the songs \"Caught Beneath Your Feet\" and \"This Road I'm Traveling.\" I'm not doing this to hit on her I didn't ask for Karrie and for all I know she's an uggo but if you're a rabid Mojave 3 fan who doesn't like what I have to say, take Karrie's endorsement to heart.
