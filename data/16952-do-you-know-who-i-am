Gone are the days when credibility was tethered to sheer lyricism, steady touring, selfpromoted mixtapes, hardwon cosigns, majorlabel affiliations, or background. Masculinity and heterosexuality are no longer a given. Instead, in 2012 we have artists buoyed by novelty and crumbling barriers, hilarity potential, and glittery snowballs of online hype. If you could somehow cash in the headspinning thrill of refreshing your Tumblr feed to find Danny Brown in Mark McNairy gear alongside Floridian princess Kitty Pryde, you could probably make a down payment on Kanye's newlyforsale mansion. At this point it's still difficult to determine whether the new school is seriously overvalued or if we've just unnecessarily moored ourselves to outmoded guidelines for too long. Sasha Go Hard is a rising Chicago rapper who straddles both the old and current systems. As a babyfaced teenage girl, she wears the coveted contemporary badge of internetsavvy hiphop outsider, frequently posting videos of her (often allfemale) cohort rolling around in hypeball extraordinaire Chief Keef's Southside Chicago neighborhood haunts, sitting pretty in oversized SUVs, and practicing dance moves. But on the other hand, Sasha is a traditionally solid rapper, and Do You Know Who I Am? is, above all, a traditionally promising mixtape from someone making steady, earned progress. It's a marked leap from an earlier tape called Glory Girl, and it's exciting to feel a rapper grow palpably better, brandishing toughtalking tunnelvision confidence.  A lot here is owed to excellent production from beat makers as hungry for recognition as Sasha is. The fleshedout beat selection from producers like Absolut P, Young Chop, and Block On Da Track here is sometimes monstrous the tape often feels like it's a machine lurching forward as metallic slugs slip and slurp through its many gears and tin pellets ricochet throughout its casing. The best beats like Absolut P's on the murderous \"A&E\" seem to rile Sasha up in the best way, acting as menacing vehicles for the compulsively simple, hypnotically repetitive hooks she's got a knack for. \"My lil' bad ass/ My li'/ My li' bad ass,\" goes one. \"Money/ Money/ Money/ Money/ I want more money,\" goes another. \"If you mad 'cuz I'm bad/ Then I'm glad/ 'Cuz you sad.\" They pile up in long chain links, making it especially exciting when Sasha chooses to switch up her tone or employ a bit of wordplay, like on \"More Money\": \"On the beat go dumb/ And dumb/ And dumb/ Feel it froggie, jump.\" On a song like posse cut \"I'm Hotta\", which features Chella H and her most immediate contemporary, Katie Got Bandz, she seems to stumble into her range by repeating the word \"bars\" in a startling way: \"Bars. Barsbars. bars. Bawwwwrs.\" On the other hand, she shows her weakness on a couple of tonedeaf slow songs, \"You the One\" and \"Tell Me\". She raps far better than she'll ever sing nothing wrong with that.  One of the best things about Do You Know Who I Am? is that it sounds sustainable, consistent from front to back in a way that could easily yield two or three more equally assertive tapes this year. Barring unforeseen interference (namely: a premature majorlabel deal), Do You Know Who I Am? could preclude a run reminiscent of 2008 and 2009era Gucci Mane, 2011era Waka Flocka Flame, or prePluto Future. It could be reminiscent of Nicki Minaj's Beam Me Up Scotty, and not simply because there's a song that's (very possibly coincidentally) titled \"Itty Bitty\" on here. For a rapper so perfectly suited to 2012 sensibilities, a return to tradition is oddly exhilarating. If anything, Sasha suggests a hopeful possibility that qualities like unfamiliarity and tradition, novelty and aptitude, hype and progress are not mutually exclusive in the future, the best artists will probably have all of it.
