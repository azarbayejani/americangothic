I am a Hal 2005 computer. I became operational in the early 2000s at the Hal plant in Kiliney, Ireland. My producer was exTears for Fears member Ian Stanley, and he taught me to sing songs. If you'd like to hear them, I can sing them for you. I'm programmed to simulate the finest of your human musicians: The Beach Boys, the Byrds, and Breakfast in Americaera Supertramp. My debut longplayer, Hal, is full of serious songs with sunny, heavily polished arrangements. West Coast, Dave. On 2004 single \"Worry About the Wind\", a sober softrock ballad, the Phil Spectorstyle reverb typical of British nostalgists builds into a hornladen coda. The lyrics are programmed for optimal universality: \"I'll worry about the wind/ You worry about the rain.\" You may also have heard bombastic opener \"What a Lovely Dance\", another 2004 single. The words: \"What a special night / wasn't thinkin' 'bout what was wrong, but what was\" yes. Listen closely for organ swirls, stolid guitar, a backwards \"Barbara Ann\" allusion, and my vast oceans of digital melancholy. Joking aside, second track and newest single \"Play the Hits\" is the one you want. Knobtwiddler Edwyn Collins (get well soon) sets vocalist modules \"Dave Allen\" and \"Paul Allen\" to Four Season falsetto, injecting a catchy Motown beat, jittery Orange Juice bass line, and infallible castanets. \"Here she comes/ And I guess she's got a lot to talk about,\" the Allens sing before oohing appropriately. You'll find finale \"Coming Right Over\" memorable for its similarities to the Supremes' recording of \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", an update with this version. You see, the 2005 series is the most reliable classicrock computer ever made. It builds on the similarly somber, canonaffirming tones of such previous models as Travis (that's the \"Sing\" banjo line on \"I Sat Down\"), the Thrills (throughout), and tourmates the Delays and Starsailor. I hesitate to mention Ocean Colour Scene. Looking forward instead to that forthcoming folkpop longplayer by fellow '60stinged newcomers The Magic Numbers? I wouldn't do that, Dave. "}
