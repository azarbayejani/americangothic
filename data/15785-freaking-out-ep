The word has come to mean a specific style glowing electronic pop that calls to mind faded photographs. But what initially drew comparisons between such groups as Washed Out, Neon Indian, and Memory Tapes wasn't such an easily identifiable set of musical signifiers. As with most category names that stick, chillwave was a feeling. There's no better example of the genre's catholic origins than Toro Y Moi mastermind Chaz Bundick. Last year's Causers of This established Toro Y Moi as one of the miniscene's leading figures, with the postcrash economic reality of lead single \"Blessa\" (\"I found a job, I do it fine/ Not what I want, but still I try\") aligning the album with Neon Indian's \"Deadbeat Summer\" and Washed Out's High Times and Bundick's fulllength debut had a warmly nostalgic electroR&B aesthetic, to boot. But by then he had already released 2009's Body Angles tape, which, yeah, presaged Causers with synthy closer \"Timed Pleasure\", but mostly emphasized scuzzy guitars. And Bundick has said he actually recorded this year's garagepop \"Leave Everywhere\" single in 2006. In the meantime, he's given us straightup dance (his Les Sins project) and an album that expands on the atmospheric funk of Causers using a lusher, more organic instrumental palette (this year's Underneath the Pine). The definition of chillwave may have to expand yet again. Memory Tapes' solid if disappointing followup to 2009's zeitgeistcapturing Seek Magic had more in common than with the sound of this Internetborn subset, but Bundick, along with Neon Indian and Washed Out, continues to embody its spirit, which was always more bodyoriented than detractors would care to admit. With the Freaking Out EP, Bundick moves from vaguely funky 1980stinged makeout jams to more explicitly funky 80stinged dancefloor jams think Chromeo. The change isn't as successful as his best work, but it still makes for a plenty rewarding betweenalbums EP. Advance mp3 \"Saturday Love\" a cover of a 1985 Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis production for R&B singers Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal is the highlight here, with its sweetly catchy daysoftheweek hook, tinkling twofinger piano, and thwacking neonew jack swing drum programming. Yearning, basslimber opener \"All Alone\" and fingersnapping dance finale \"I Can Get Love\" even share the strobelike keyboards present on much of Causers the last song has that postDilla crackle, too. And \"Sweet\" applies the chopped up vocals and hazy incandescence of that album to further 80sstyle R&B. \"Take it easy,\" Bundick soothes on the title track, another uptempo floorfiller. \"Don't worry anymore... Calm down.\" I mean, how much more chillwave can you get, right? "}
