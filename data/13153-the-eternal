Its strengths and weaknesses are all upfront in fact they're pretty well encapsulated in the first two tracks. Opener \"Sacred Trickster\" is a quick, adrenalized rocker in the vein of 2006's similarly straightforward Rather Ripped. Slamming to a stop after a tight two minutes, the band then tears into \"AntiOrgasm\", exploding into biting noise halfway through before the song eventually drifts into beatific, instrumental wandering. It's a familiar move that Sonic Youth have deployed to strong effect many times (try \"Pacific Coast Highway\" on 1987's Sister or \"Rain on Tin\" on 2002's \"Murray Street for starters). But here it seems to come too soon an autopilot turn that rings a bit offkey.The rest of The Eternal runs through similar cycles of ebb and flow. And while the flow outweighs the ebb, it doesn't always defeat it. Many of the band's signature styles are welltimed: the concise blasts from guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo during the bridge of \"Calming the Snake\", the slowbuilding denouement of \"Walkin Blue\", the acoustic flourishes that give closer \"Massage the History\" a chilly mood. But sometimes the goto moves feel forced take Moore's stiff rant on \"Thunderclap (For Bobby Pyn)\", or the deadend bridge of \"Leaky Lifeboat (For Gregory Corso)\". The best Sonic Youth albums cohere enough to withstand misstepssometimes even make virtues out of them but here the stuttersteps stick out a bit, putting The Eternal on a middle rung of Sonic Youth's discographical ladder.Which still means it's pretty damn good. There's no denying the vitality of songs like \"Antenna\", a Moore singtheguitarline classic akin to A Thousand Leaves' \"Sunday\" or Murray Street's \"The Empty Page\". \"Radios play nothing when she's far away/ TV antenna rusts and gone to waste,\" Moore contemplates, his voice decaying along with his chiming strings. Just as good are two Ranaldo songs, the aforementioned \"Walkin Blue\" a swaying rocker with Beat poetinfluenced couplets and \"What We Know\", sort of an elongated update on Rather Ripped's \"Rats\". \"Heaven's not about your reputation,\" he sings, musing about \"stepping across the great divide.\" Like much of The Eternal, \"What We Know\" seems fixated on death, loss, and what little can be known about either.High points like that might hit harder without some surrounding lags, like the ZZTopondowners \"Poison Arrow\", or the weary yeahyeah's of \"Thunderclap (for Bobby Pyn)\" especially since each of those tunes is followed by a similar, much better track. The chugging guitars of \"Malibu Gas Station\" trump \"Poison Arrow\" with spedup, Televisionlike twinguitar, while the wiry energy of \"No Way\", with its Ramonesish chorus (\"I'm not talking to you no more,\" chants Moore), echoes classic punk better than \"Thunderclap\".But then it's easy to nitpick with a group that has been this good for this long and always offers a lot to comb through and dissect. Besides, The Eternal could turn out to be a grower. It certainly has happened before with Sonic Youth, whose unique place in rock history as a kind of living glue between late70s postpunk and 90s alternative, 80s DIY indie and 00s netage, tight pop and improvised noise, hard punk and hippie jams, etc. is secure, no matter what time reveals about individual albums. At the very least, some excellent songs lurk among these 12 tracks, and there's enough potential for debate about which are which to make The Eternal worthy of Sonic Youth's singular canon.
