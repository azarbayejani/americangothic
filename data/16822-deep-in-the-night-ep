Despite the precedent set by the two Chinoiseries volumes that straddled his 2010 breakthrough, the big pull of Long Distance was an instantly gratifying sound that demanded to be elaborated on. His beats reassembled fractured vintage synth funk and R&B tropes, glossy stateoftheart in '87 tightness into a new stutterstep looseness, like machines rebuilt with duct tape and wire hangers. If that approach recalled a lot of oftcited predecessors and peers imagine making a case for a Dillaevoking beatcreator at that style's most overwhelming saturation point it at least did so favorably, and in a way that focused on a distinct space of his own. So is the next step to make that space more distinct, or just larger? The fivesong Deep in the Night EP doesn't really answer that, which could be frustrating depending on how demanding you are of a 16.5minute EP to represent forward motion instead of a mere supplement. Onra's gotten some enduring mileage out of these rollerrink throwbacks, owing equally to a keen ear for sources and a crafty idea of how to manipulate them. From a reverseengineering perspective it can be fun to get at where he's going with his sample alteration, like how \"L.O.V.E.\" slows Slave's '84 jam \"Share Your (L.O.V.E.)\" down to a firstgear residential neighborhood crawl and flips that percolating synthesizer burble in on itself over a doorkicking 4/4 kickclap. But even when \"Somewhere (Deep in the Night)\" and \"Hold Tight\" embody everything great about this sound of Onra's, they pull right at the same pleasure centers in the same ways that \"Send Me Your Love\" and \"Sitting Back\" did: digital chimes rattle from the gusts caused by helicopterblade keyboards, drum machines are manhandled into something more offthecuff and improvisational. Vocal hooks get reduced to the three or four notes that hit the hardest before getting split apart or cut off, appealing in the same ways as \"Send Me Your Love\" and \"Sitting Back\" are. Deep in the Night fits Long Distance's approach closely enough that you could append this EP to the end of that album, maintain that Michael ManndirectsSoul Train feel, and still squeeze it all in the traditional 80minutesorless CD length. It might help ward off suspicions of overfamiliarity to pretend that some of the stylistic echoes are actually thematic callbacks instead of just redundancies. \"After Hours\" is a midtempo boogiefunk pastiche featuring a loverman verse from Slum Village's T3, coming across like a breathless rebound to his breakup lament on \"The One\". And the beathead romance of \"V.B.B.\" Amalia actually answers Jay Kin's call for \"oldschool love\" with the promise of \"recorddiggin' 'til the morning\" is like the personification of every obsessive lifestylemusic synthesis that made Long Distance sound like the work of a collector turned creator. Deep in the Night just shows the early signs of a pressing need to dig a bit deeper. "}
