During the heady 90s, all Bachmann ever wanted was to be your spine. And now? He's Neil Diamond as hardluck piano matador. Give him some candy. The title track of Archers' 1998 swan song, White Trash Heroes, hinted at the direction Bachmann's next project would take: ominous, backporch Americana, centered on his brassy \"Cracklin' Rosie\" vocals rather than spastic punk noise. Bachmann's literate songwriting and (college) radioready pop melodicism survived the transition, particularly on orchestraladen masterpieces like \"New Drink for the Old Drunk\" or \"Angelina\". At a bar, those tracks would be ordering whiskey shotforshot with W.C. Fields while most of Dignity and Shame was in the bathroom spewing its second sangria. The latest from Bachmann and his rotating cast of accompanists is a loosely conceptual Iberian love epic. \"Loosely,\" because only three or four songs really relate to the cover art's reddevil bullfighter and the lusty flamenco dancers on the back (the soused narrator of Gracelandbouncy \"Valerie\" probably isn't serenading a se√±orita). Early reviews invoking the album's \"Southwestern\" influences should be forgiven; surely they meant southwestern Spain, home to the Andalucia province and its many bullrings. Slowbuilding instrumental opener \"Islero\" sets the scene with Sevillana guitar flourishes, wistful Latin trumpets, and faraway congas. The piece takes its name from the bull that gored the famous matador Manolete to death in 1947. Yet at the song's apex, where a Gipsy Kings dance number might have emerged had Bachmann rolled a strike, instead there's just \"Weary Arms\", a preachy (if catchy) series of cavernous bromides. \"You've been waiting your whole life to make your move/ So make your move,\" we're told. \"Andalucia\" sheds more light on Bachmann's Spanish theme. Pitterpatter drums and a numbing guitar riff square off with wideopen choruses about a girl named Antonita and the album's most allusive lyrics. The summer of 1917 was \"splendid\" in Andalucia, the song asserts, presumably due to romance. This was a few years before Ernest Hemingway's arrival, and Spain was wracked with workers' strikes inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution. It's also the summer Manolete was born. The narrator, a matador himself, boldly challenges the \"Miuras\"  Islero's breed of bull, and the most feared. But his prayers to Saint Veronica, who is credited with giving Jesus a kerchief to wipe his brow on the road to Golgotha, apparently go unanswered. For some reason (a wound, most likely), the young bullfighter must leave behind Antonita and his homeland for one year. \"Andalucia\" is a farewell love song. Regrettably, no other song here has a lyric nearly as compelling as \"Andalucia\" a major flaw for what is essentially a pedal steelenhanced singer/songwriter album. \"Call to Love\" offers an awkward metaphor and one of a few duets with Australian singer Lara Meyerratken. \"How am I supposed to hear or take heed to this call to love?\" is among the stilted lines Bachmann gives her, while the verse melody unflatteringly meshes with Tom Petty's \"American Girl\". As malefemale backandforth goes, this is no \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\" (or \"Nothing Better\", or \"I Got a Man\", or...).Dignity and Shame also sheds blood from its chosen genre's doubleedged sword: This kind of rootsy, ruminative pop inevitably teeters on the brink of the AAA abyss a place where songs are served in tall, grande, and venti. If you thought the previous Crooked Fingers albums showcased Bachmann's softer side, you haven't heard \"Twilight Creeps\", in which he muses, \"Why does everybody act so tough/ When all anybody wants is to find a friend?\" One of the disc's most instantly memorable songs is, for better or worse, \"Twilight Creeps\" is also the first of several where Bachmann's falsetto sounds uncannily like the dude from Five for Fighting. Well, it's not easy to be Bachmann, either: \"Where are you, love?\" he laments on acoustic weeper \"You Must Build a Fire\". And where are you, the subtle genius behind \"Andalucia\" and Vs. the Greatest of All Time? On \"Destroyer\", Bachmann's narrator seems to confuse the intimate/violent manbull relationship with the interpersonal kind, telling a lover to \"lay down, let it come\" and \"resign your heart today to get blown away.\" All of which may or may not be a coded message to Dan Bejar. At least there's a raucous jam at the coda, which the otherwiseforgettable \"Coldways\" also provides. By the albumclosing title track, Bachmann's matadornarrator is presumably dead, covered in mud and leaves. He's also back in advicecolumn mode, tossing out a few rhymes Jimmy Eat World would kill for: \"You've got to carry your heart like a torch in the night/ Little keeper of light/ Burning deep, burning bright.\" Dignified? I guess. But this kind of justgoodenough songmanufacturing coming from Bachmann, on a record that glimmers with underdeveloped artistry, is a crying shame. As he explains on \"Sleep All Summer\": \"I would change for you, but babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man.\" "}
