Some critics were turned off by Williams' bombastic, proclamatory emceeing, which often made no pretense of rhythmic consistency or tonal variety. Yet despite a few bland passages, it was one of my favorite albums of '01. Williams' lyrical turns as a wise punster, revealing the subliminal messages and connections embedded in our language, approached the transcendent. A style that struck some as sterile fed others a powerful rhetorical fire, backed by violins and breakbeats. At the album's climax, on the DJ Krush collaboration \"Coded Language\", Williams fervently delivered an indictment of modern consciousness in an engineer's technical jargon, culminating in a rapidfire postmodern jumble of historical figures. It remains an overpowering moment, delivered with the manic energy of a preacher. Williams often exalts the power of metaphor, and the cover of his new selftitled release a photograph of him driving in a truck, ready to shout through a bullhorn indeed allegorizes the music within. The messages of Saul Williams are still delivered with fervency, but the album is musically and lyrically aimed at a wider audience than his debut. Unfortunately, anything shouted through a bullhorn becomes distorted, and in a fastmoving vehicle, one's words must be kept simple and easy to digest. The music here moves away from Rock Star's adventurousness, to attempt a hybridization of his honed social/metaphysical perspective with a more populist sound. As he says on intro \"Talk to Strangers\": \"The earth is not a flat screen/ I ain't trying to fit in/ But this ain't for the underground/ This here is for the sun.\" The recurring theme of Saul Williams is a resistance to egoistic obstinacy, through messages such as \"vulnerability is power,\" and \"God is change\" a sentiment reverberating through his shifting musical style. Here, Williams often adopts the lineage built by socially conscious rappers Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine rap backed by a hardcore outfit. It's clear that he's after an atmosphere of turgid energy to match his calls to consciousness. There's little downtime, and the first half of the album maintains a consistently urgent feel. The dramatic piano and choir of his intro (written by System of a Down's Serj Tankian) gives way to \"Grippo\"'s dissonant guitar, and a song that contains some of the album's best lines: \"I gave hiphop to white boys when nobody was looking/ They found it locked in a basement when they gentrified Brooklyn.../ So substitute the anger and oppression/ With guilt and depression/ And it's yours.\" \"Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare)\", which features guest vocals by Zack de la Rocha, connects America's involvement in Iraq to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: \"This one goes out to my man/ Taking cover in the trenches with a gun in his hand/ Then gets home and no one flinches when he can't feed his fam/ But Brutus is an honorable man.\" The album's second half is spottier, containing more forgettable material. Williams' singing voice is too thin to carry his sometimes soulful melodies, and songs like \"Surrender (A Second to Think)\" can be difficult to listen to. But \"Control Freak\" is a catchy, concise track, and \"Seaweed\" recalls his more musically adventurous journeys of fantastical imagery, with a marimba sample and ethereal female vocals. Though most hiphop albums strain at the temporal boundaries of a CD, Williams' is over at the 45minute mark. Saul Williams' recent book of poetry, Said the Shotgun to the Head, is astounding in its use of type and font to imply vocal cadence and overall movement, but his recorded voice is sometimes less expressive. His efforts here to fit his spoken word into consistent oldschool measures dilutes the power in his lyrics, where webs of internal rhyme are abandoned for A/B/A/B schemes. The best tracks hearken back to his original style. Sections of \"Telegram\" are reminiscent of Rock Star single \"Penny for a Thought\" in their rhetorical conceits and thematic focus on the enlightenment of hiphop: \"We are discontinuing our current line of braggadocio/ In light of the current trend in realness/ Stop/ As an alternative we will be confiscating weed supplies/ And replacing them with magic mushrooms/ In hopes of helping niggas see beyond their reality/ Stop.\" While the confines of form can help some artists with expressionistic originality, it's freedom that allows Williams' full impact to be made. Similarly, it's a welcome return to his trademark invocations made on closer \"Notice of Eviction\": \"Author of wind and change/ Phantom of the opera/ Tenor of the octave range/ Spews volcanic lava.\" It's probably a frustration to artists like Saul Williams to feel as though they're preaching to the converted, when their message is one of widespread mental enlightenment. While the experimentalism of slam poetry is aimed at making complex or subtle emotions digestible to large audiences, musical experimentation tends to immediately alienate large portions of listeners. Still, Saul Williams is stuck between two conceits. To fulfill the huge potential inherent in his style, he's either going to have to find more abstract sonics and freer forms to compliment his equally liquid verse, or fully give himself over to writing some radiofriendly, MTVready material. Either would be a good move from a poet with the potential to fully embody the fiercely potent voice of right now. "}
