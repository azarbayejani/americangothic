{"label":" Def Jam","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/14551/homepage_large.91855a7a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tom Breihan","artist":"Ghostface Killah","title":"Ghostdini: The Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City","text":" On the face of it, a Ghostface R&B album isn't the worst idea in the world. Ghost, after all, has traveled this ground before. On his debut album Ironman, he enlisted Mary J. Blige for \"All That I Got Is You\", a gutwrenching memoir of a childhood spent picking roaches out the cereal box. And on The Pretty Toney Album nugget \"Holla\", he straightup rapped over an entire sweaty Delfonics oldie, his urgent yowl thrillingly banging against the song's weeping strings and punchdrunk guitars. Ghost understands how soul music works, and many of his own best records strive for transcendence as hard as any old Al Green jam. If he'd used either of those tracks as the basis for The Wizard of Poetry, we could have a classic on our hands.But you review the album you got, not the album you wanted. Rather than either of those tracks, Ghost has built his R&B experiment, understandably enough, around the only song of his to get significant New York radio burn in recent years: The NeYo collaboration \"Back Like That\", the sole Hot 97 concession on the otherwise hardasfuck Fishscale. (The Kanyeassisted remix shows up here as a bonus track even though it was already on More Fish three years ago.) \"Back Like That\" wasn't a bad song far from it but it's tough to imagine how Ghost thought he could make an album full of that, especially when he didn't land a single guest singer anywhere near as talented as NeYo.In fact, it's tough to imagine how The Wizard of Poetry came into existence in the first place. If it's a A&Rdriven commercial Hail Mary, then how did the Def Jam authorities allow Ghost to get away with \"Stapleton Sex\", the squirmiest fuck jam in recent memory? \"Stapleton Sex\", which Ghost hilariously alleges he wrote for Natalie Portman, starts out with \"My face is wet, got a hair on my tongue,\" and only gets more greasily specific from there. (\"This ain't no R&B dick,\" he helpfully points out.) But if the whole album is Ghost's baby, then why is he paired up with scrubass R&B new jacks like Lloyd and Ron Brownz? I promise you, Ghost doesn't bang any Lloyd CDs in his car.As a writer, though, Ghost remains fascinating and contradictory. Check, for instance, opening track \"Not Your Average Girl\", where he builds his perfect woman (she should be on the couch reading a book and biting a pen when she gets home, but also shoot home invaders, which seems like a tall order) before tossing all that to the side on the last verse: \"We run trains on them bitches, never ice they arms.\" Or \"Do Over\", where he starts out hangdog, apologizing for every form of infidelity before revealing that he's on a bus to prison, apologizing for that, too, and signing off with this: \"Thanks for your patience. You find a man. I hope he's true.\"Even the halfassed songs are filled with enormously likable turns of phrase, like when Ghost interrupts a story midsentence to refer to himself as a \"prestigious gentleman.\" So many great little verbal moments here: \"The smell of her fragrance baffled my nostrils,\" \"My dick is hard as a callus,\" \"I pull out like a tooth in the back, it's rotten.\" A totally sincere pickup line: \"I would love to have a thing like you on the team.\" Another: \"I love it like that, stretchmark fat.\" And Ghost delivers all this stuff straightfaced; he doesn't do punchlines. Even when he's trying to be as straightforward as possible, his mind works in fascinating ways. You just have to wade through swamps of dreck to find those brilliant little moments.The Wizard of Poetry has exactly one indispensable moment: the weirdly gripping storysong \"Guest House\", where Ghost bugs out looking for his girlfriend before finding her banging the cable guy, played by a titanically goofy Fabolous. Ghost's response: \"Snatched his covers/ Had them looking like the black Adam and Eve, two sinful lovers.\" \"Guest House\" comes packed with the same plot twists and telling details and a breathless crime narrative like \"Shakey Dog\", but it uses them in the service of, basically, a soap opera, or a \"Trapped in the Closet\" chapter. It works in a way that almost nothing else here completely manages. "}
