The template he created for himself as solo electro maniac Hawnay Troof has come close to sounding like a onetrick pony at times, but that is set to change with the release of his third album, Islands of Ayle, which was largely assembled during a 20month world tour and features samples recorded everywhere from the Swiss Alps to Beijing. Here we can hear Cooler breaking his own mold with a fully realized album that fuses his hotheaded and fun approach to music making with some surprisingly great experimentation.The most enjoyable aspect of Islands of Ayle is Cooler's bold employment of traditional hiphop rhythmic structures, which dishevel his more standard electropunk patterns and allow the arrangements on this album to be completely thrilling this is the sound of a young musician who is not afraid to fuck with anything, or try something new, and this attitude leaves every track with an aftertaste as bright and strong as neon. The result is undoubtedly erratic, as Cooler intersperses classic common meter MCing in the style of RunD.M.C. and Beastie Boys with unexpected breaks and fierce synth patches that burst out all over the place like the startling unpredictability of fireworks. (In fact, this record borrows so much from Hello Nasty that if Cooler wasn't so exploratory and lighthearted in his approach it would verge on ridiculous; even Jenny Hoyston sounds like Mike D in her guest appearance on \"Out of Teen Revisited\".)Unlike his contemporaries, such as Pittsburgh duo Grand Buffet and fellow west coaster Gold Chains, Cooler doesn't focus on creating anthemic melodies. His hooks are like hot potatoes: just when you get into it, he sweeps the beat to leave you hanging. The closest he comes to sticking to his guns is \"Underneath the Ocean\", which features lovely vocals from High Places' Mary Pearson. Elsewhere, tracks like the recent single \"Connection\" match bratty cat calling with intricately layered programming, and \"Bizarre Triangle\" sizzles with lyrical wildness, finishing up with a dirty edged skit that could either be about sex or cake baking (Cooler actually released his first cookbook, \"The Hungry Truth\", in 2005).Of course, underneath the silver hiphop lining and flirtations with Kanye West style vocal samples fused with the type of dance euphoria that would make the Chemical Brothers proud (such as \"Venus Venus Piper\"), Cooler is a punk rock kid still firmly rooted to the west coast DIY scene that he has been a part of since moving from Alabama in 1998. This celebration of community is imprinted all over Islands of Ayle: Cooler drafted a slew of pals, including Randy Randall (No Age), Jamie Stewart (Xiu Xiu), and Carla Bozulich, to contribute to the album proper, while a limitededition CD offers a selection of remixes from Lucky Dragons, Mae Shi, and Soft Pink Truth.When Cooler sings \"If you've got your walk down, I hope you fully walk\" on \"Connection\" one can't help feeling that he has taken his own advice. In just over 30 minutes, he leaves an impression of a confidence that has moved beyond the ego and into a territory that enables him to get away with just about anything. "}
