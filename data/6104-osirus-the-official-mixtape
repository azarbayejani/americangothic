{"label":" Sure Shot / JC","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/6020/homepage_large.15c07460.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nick Sylvester","artist":"Ol' Dirty Bastard","title":"Osirus: The Official Mixtape","text":" In the rap family portrait, Ol' Dirty Bastard was the Downsy 30yearold cousin with his pants pulled down. Nobody asked him to do this obviously, and though the scene was gross, nobody protested either. Everybody just laughed the only option, really. ODB had so successfully blurred the line between playing the fool and actually being retarded, nobody would dare criticize him for fear of seeming pointlessly cruel or, worse, painfully out of the loop. ODB was better than a fool though: Not only did he say and do what others didn't, but where fools get away with their foolishness, ODB fell victim to his own heedlessness at every turn. He lived the life cash money, bitches, crack, fast cars, etc. but unlike others, ODB always suffered the consequences: poverty, child support, crippling addiction, prison, and traffic violations. ODB was simultaneously everything and nothing most MCs want to be. A few seconds into \"Pop Shots\" the lead track on the posthumous Osirus: The Official Mixtape ODB invokes his most foolish public display, that surprise interruption of Puffy's Grammy acceptance speech in 1998. \"Look here, more money, more problems, my ass/ You're a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real/ That's a trick to try to keep you where you at/ All content, while niggas ridin' Bentleys and Maybach\", the fool says. He's right to chide, wrong to look past the personal contradiction but in the end completely unassailable, if only because he's ODB. At this point only our coolest friends can say, \"I'm Rick James, bitch!\" when they break their own rules. Really though, no one maybe not even Rick James himself deserves the line more than ODB. Nigga Please made the Superfreak/ODB kinship explicit, and the best tracks on Osirus pin Dirt's ululations and doubleedged sexcrazed rants on coldblooded, rubberband funk. An early titfortat with Rhymefest on \"Dirty Dirty\" makes the gluttonous ODB sound like a permanent morality play: \"What can make a ho look more cuter?/ Hennessy shots and smoke more buddha/ [I don't know, Dirt, now she look like Jab Zuda/ Test my manhood go get my dick ruler]/ Now you're hungry wanna eat right through her\". Similarly, none of us should ever command a girl, \"Come sit on MiniMe and put a smile on Dr. Evil,\" as on slow jam \"P*ssy Keep Calling\", but we're happy ODB said it if only to remind us that we shouldn't. Says Rhymefest, \"What's rap without Dirt? What's the whole world without Dirt? Just a bunch of fucking water.\" Extend the dirt/water boast to the rapper/producer relationship on Osirus, and we get to the mixtape's biggest flaws most beats are shit, and guests flow muddily. This isn't The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones Part II, but RZA's production is again sorely missed. When tracks go retrothug without a hitch (several of them do), ODB just sounds pastprime and pathetic: \"If y'all want war/ let's get it on/ Cause we don't care/ Where y'all from\" is a career nadir. \"Down South\" is, I guess, a Lil Jon crunk sendup, but the song's too listless to make a point of it. However official this mixtape says it is, Osirus is still just a test run for Ol' Dirty Bastard's more official posthumous release on RocAFella later this year. Which is good news, of course. For every posthumous album, there's a Posthumous Album Game to be played, and hardcore ODB fans will surely pore over his last release hoping to uncover a death prophecy. Perfect fool that he is though, ODB has been hinting at his death since the beginning of his career. Every asinine rhyme he's dropped, every child support check he hasn't paid, every little girl he's saved from a moving vehicle's impact from all these, we can be sure ODB intimately understood his fate. Otherwise, wow, what a fucking retard that guy was. "}
