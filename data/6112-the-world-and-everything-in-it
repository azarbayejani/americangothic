While their music stays within tight constraints, the lyrics touch upon waves, mountains, open air, outer space, drug cities, talking sharks, and being punk enough to get kicked out of your house downtown all in about 39 minutes. Vocalist/guitarist Roman Kuebler's lyrics won't be the first thing you'll notice, however. The band's most distinguishing trait is Kuebler's formal, mannered singing, sounding like an prerock crooner or (oh boy) an angstfree Rob Dickinson. Along with the vintage tones from their sparse acoustic strumming and fuzzy guitar lines, his voice gives their power pop a touch of '50s garagerock and doowop, enhancing the album's lazy summer feel and keeping one foot charmingly out of time. \"Believe\" is an curious opener, merging a steady rock rhythm with twists in melody and a few bursts of Hammond organ, but the two \"wave\" songs are early highlights. \"Ride the Wild Wave\" moves on galloping eighth notes and falsetto backing vocals as Kuebeler sings of catching the elusive wave from Endless Summer and riding it around the world. \"Ride the Nuclear Wave\", on the other hand, might be the album's most spirited performance. While it may take two or three listens to seep in, there's an irresistible headbobbing melody to be found in its ringing singlenote guitar line and fantastical lyrics. While the band constrains themselves to classic sounds, there's enough small surprises to give The World and Everything in It the variety it needs. \"Believe\" and the light picking of \"Drug City\" divert from the 4/4 guitaranddrums arrangements, and the title track adds irregular stabs of organ and echochamber vocals to a southern blues shuffle, changing the atmosphere nicely. The nod to \"Rumble Blues\" before the speeding chords of \"Mountain\" or the staccato strumming seconds before \"Atmosphere\" kicks in are simple, effective tricks. The Oranges Band's playing is impressive but never flashy, and the melodies are inviting without being cloying. The World And Everything In It is a perfect summer afternoon record, quietly and capably flowing from Track 1 through 12 without a misstep. "}
