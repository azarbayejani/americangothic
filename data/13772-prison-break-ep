{"label":" Sincerely Yours","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/14806/homepage_large.d967a605.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"The Tough Alliance","title":"Prison Break EP","text":" \"We have a world of pleasure to win, and nothing to lose but boredom.\" That manifesto shows up a few times on the Tough Alliancerun Sincerely Yours label's website. As is the Gothenburg, Swedenbased electronic pop duo's habit, the words are borrowed, in this case from Belgian author and Situationist International member Raoul Vaneigem. You could think of TTA's music as sort of a living shrine to pleasure: unabashedly catchy, defiantly emotional, with gaudy synthetic beats and fuckyou bravado. But nobody can stave off boredom forever.In fact, TTA have been conspicuously quiet lately. Since releasing A New Chance, their second fullfledged album, in 2007, coconspirators Eric Berglund and Henning FÃ¼rst have put out precious little new material under the TTA name: a pair of covers, a remix of Victoria Bergsman's Taken by Trees, and various remixes by other people of their own songs. The six TTA remixes collected on the mp3only Prison Break EP are uniformly solid and occasionally revelatory dancefloor fare, well worth any Swedehead's $5.35. But Prison Break is an exceptionally weird release. As good as it is, this EP should have the duo's fans growing only more and more impatient for the next album or single unknown pleasures, still.In early November, Sincerely Yours mailing list subscribers received a typically enigmatic message, with one link to a new track by jj, and another to information about this EP. \"Better late than never,\" the linked page says; digital music seller Klicktrack lists Prison Break's release date as Oct. 31, 2008. The fuck? What's more, these remixes don't change the title of the original track, a naming convention that's usually standard for the Sincerely Yours crew (\"Now That's What I Call Indulgence\", not \"Indulgence (The Tough Alliance Remix)\"; \"The Sweetness of Air France\", not \"Sweetness (Air France Remix)\"). One possible clue: Two of these remixes, a ravey \"Neo Violence\" by Dutch DJ/producer Laidback Luke (grab his remix of Robin S.'s \"Show Me Love\" with Sweden's Steve Angello) and a dubby spacedisco \"Neo Violence\" by L.A.based DFA/Rong signee Woolfy, came out in 2008 on Modular not Sincerely Yours. Regardless, rounding out a trio of \"Neo Violence\" takes here is a fine Daft Punkstyle electrohouse reworking by Perthbased Shazam.Whatever Prison Break's origins, the people you expect to be the heavyhitters pretty much are. Barcelona's El Guincho is a TTA kindred spirit, sharing their yen for sunny globetrotting, but his chiming, euphoric \"First Class Riot\" gets overshadowed a bit by jj's absolutely radiant \"touch of jules & jim\" version. Taking a name from 1962 French film Jules & Jim, jj's remix puts a hushed female voice alongside TTA's, which jj chop up and toy with like marionettes (or like that Grateful Dead sample on \"What Would I Want? Sky\"), making TTA shout out \"touch of you\" and then a sublimely dumb \"da da\" melody atop girlish giggles and John Williamsgrandiose orchestration. The Juan MacLean's \"A New Chance\", meanwhile, remains near perfection, ensconcing the original in the finest technohouse marble for future generations to marvel upon.\"It's not a question of understanding it, man. If you feel it, you feel it, stupid.\" That quote, from a John Cassavetes film, shows up more than once on this EP, and it's still the best encapsulation of the Sincerely Yours spirit. We could quibble about the absence of Brooklyn duo Tanlines' highlifemeetsWhigfield \"A New Chance\" remix, or California krautrockdisco duo Windsurf's \"Neo Violence (Windsurf's Neon Violet Dub)\", or other DJready TTA remixes by Alvy Singer and Stevie Tech Nicks. But those are all pretty easily downloadable at this point. More urgent: The Sincerely Yours catalog description for Prison Break mentions that TTA are \"on short term leave.\" We have no new(ish) TTA to listen to but this. Until the next randomass listserv email. "}
