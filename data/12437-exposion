Their selfreleased Let's Talk About It EP was twitchy and muddy it both stood out alongside the more orderly indie rock set and seemed advanced for an unsigned band. Decidedly raw, their psychblues riffs were fun to trace as they careened into jammier territory. The Austin group went on to issue Workout Holiday, a fulllength released only in Europe; now a reshuffled version, Exposion, serves as its U.S. debut.With the ommission of EP tracks \"Let's Talk About It\" and \"Darksided Computer Mouth\", Exposion isn't so easily characterized and the group comes off as more versatile, more than DIY Nuggets throwbacks. Opener \"Don't Look That Way at It\" loops a chickenscratch guitar and mashes it into a loose, sorethroated chorus. The song seems to outline their central creed: paint the neat sloppy, the tight loose, the drunk totally in control, and force nothing. With guitar noodling galore, much of Exposion accentuates those aims. The more straightforward \"Shake Shake Shake\" and \"Transparency\" are fully realized rockers that unravel and work out their psychedelic tangles in eventually thoughtful closing arguments. On the flip side, the breezy electric folk of \"Heart From Us All\" builds and fills before spilling into a beautiful vocal turn by frontguy James Petralli.\"Shake Shake Shake\" in particular showcases bassist Steve Terebecki's gift for putting songs on his back. Alongside drummer Josh Block's polyrhythmic supernovas, the two form a timekeeping section that can maul and tickle almost simultaneously, depending on the tenor of Petralli's shouts and croon. \"You Can't Say\" is a refreshingly focused and tenderfooted shoegazer that puts his pipes on ice. It's a standout moment that provides a much more satisfying breather than instrumental \"Migration Wind\", a punchy jazz number that threatens to jump the tracks. Then again, a band this chaotic and unpredictable probably designed those tracks to twist and turn that way in the first place. "}
