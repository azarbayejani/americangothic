{"label":" Priority","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/12576/homepage_large.8991288a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Ice Cube","title":"The Essentials","text":" It would be too easy to suggest that anything calling itself the essential Ice Cube should include Kill At Will, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, and Death Certificate in their entirety. But that would denigrate what is a surprisingly noble pursuit on what could presumptively be a cynical attempt to wring one last dollar out of Cube's recording legacy: This isn't a greatest hits collection, as Cube has two of those already, including a compilation of his soundtrack work (just in case you really dug The Players Club). It's also a difficult to determine what qualifies as essential: \"It Was a Good Day\" and \"Check Yo Self\" are his most popular songs (both are included), but those didn't land Ice Cube a story in Time back when the nation as a whole was still getting acquainted with gangsta rap tracks like \"Black Korea\" (46 seconds of inexcusable racebaiting that intentionally misused the point of Do The Right Thing) and \"A Bitch Iz a Bitch\" did.Against those odds, The Essentials mostly succeeds in balancing his MTV hits with trenchant deep cuts while properly weighing towards his earlier work without completely negating everything he's done since 1994. More often than not, it's a bracing reminder of a potency that's been diluted through the filter of one dubious movie choice after another Cube's rarely mentioned as one of hiphop's greatest storytellers, but an economy of words and deft hand with plot have injected much of his politically minded material with a timelessness that's actually pretty sad (and not just because the boogeyman is always named \"Bush\"). The petty thugs here are more likely to be dealing with the consequences of their actions instead of enjoying wealth or exploring the minutiae of their illegal dealings, something that stands in stark relief of the nihilism that's come to afflict most drug rap of the 21st century. Yes, there are endemic societal problems that leave people with no choice, but no one's absolved, especially since most of the characters realize the situation and yet find themselves dumb enough to be doing wrong anyway. It's a little disappointing that \"Who's the Mack?\" isn't included, because in each of its acts, the circumstance can be explained with \"you knew the game and you still ended up on your back.\" Take the immortal first line from \"Bird in the Hand\" \"Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad/ Gots to get a job cause I was a high school dad.\" Slowly, Cube becomes not necessarily an outlaw, but someone almost bemusedly starts living outside of the law (\"Now I remember, I used to be cool/ Until I stopped filling out my W2\") until the government has to give a shit out of custodial concern. \"What Can I Do\" works in reverse, a displaced dealer too unlucky to die young, forced to work in McDonald's as a freshlyreleased inmate with no marketable skills. Existing somewhere in between is \"My Summer Vacation\", which deftly explores how supply and demand (\"in L.A. everybody and they mama sell dope\") leads a couple of Cali gangbangers to set up shop in St. Louis and act as one of many germ cells that spread \"gang violence where it was never seen before.\"   Obviously, not every cut here is prime material placing \"Go to Church\" first is a canny bit of sequencing, since it immediately puts you facetoface with everything you've been trying to forget about 21st century Cube, 21st century Snoop, and the three years in which Lil Jon was forcing people into making headbussa anthems against their best interests. Fortunately, the silly Don Mega stuff of the late90s gets excised, but \"Supreme Hustle\" and \"War & Peace\" do little to redeem his work of the time. Even the early stuff can be mishandled \"Givin' Up the Nappy Dugout\", a decidedly minor cut, could've easily been replaced by the song it precedes on Death Certificate (\"Look Who's Burnin'\"), which denounced sexual promiscuity with a positive message that spared no one (\"Got you a college boy that was worse than me/ And he probably fucked the whole university\").  Despite its importance as a fulcrum in Cube's catalog, The Predator gets a somewhat awkward treatment. Wisely banking on alternative nation synergy, The Predator became the first album to debut at #1 on both the R&B and pop charts, in large part due to his inclusion on Lollapalooza (not to mention him smashing up an Aframe with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the video for \"Wicked\"). But while many saw it as a large dip in quality from AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted and Death Certificate, its context in the wake of the L.A. Riots gave him a certain sense of closure and justification (\"I told you it would happen and you heard it, read it/ But all you could call me was antiSemitic\"). \"When Will They Shoot?\" is more remarkable for its titanic XClan derived stomp than its narrative, but it's likely the wisest inclusion over fantasies either badly dated (\"Who Got The Camera?\") or aimless (\"Dirty Mack\").As with any collection of this sort, the question ends up being \"who is this for, exactly?\" Cube's discography isn't the most daunting out there, and a rather solid consensus exists as to which ones are worth picking up. But as is, it's enough of a teaser to remind you of his greatness, plus all the gems left out the searing selfanalysis of \"Us\" (unfortunately coopted by neocons like Dinesh D'Souza), EazyEthering \"No Vaseline\", or even \"Bop Gun (One Nation)\", which could've at least represented the rightfully ignored Lethal Injection with Cube's most bizarre number. Still, the finale \"Cold Places\", proves Cube's rage still runs cold even if his influence has precipitously declined. Despite some stilted references to Obama and Hurricane Katrina, in a time where political apathy is considered noble since it refuses to legitimize a process that's obviously failed, maybe we need to hear from him more than ever even if it's just sticking with the essentials.
