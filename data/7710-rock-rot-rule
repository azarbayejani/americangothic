Tom Scharpling deejays \"The Best Show On WFMU,\" WFMU being the legendary and amazingly multiform New York/New Jersey station on which programs as interesting as that of outsidermusicologist Irwin Chusid air. Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster telephones Scharpling's show, in different irritating guises, and people initially were fooled into calling and joining the discussion; 1997's singleshow Rock, Rot & Rule captures this era. By the one 2000 show and five 2001 shows compiled on the twodisc Chain Fights, Beer Busts, and Service With A Grin, most of the audience is savvy to the show's premise, but they still call in as ironic participants. Yes, this prank has been done to death by practitioners of wildly varying merit, but I've heard no one as witty, as satirical, or as gleefully selfaware as this duo.Rock, Rot & Rule is a faux promotional interview with \"Ronald Thomas Clontle,\" who has \"written\" a book that's just a list dividing all of popular music history into the categories \"rock,\" \"rot,\" and \"rule.\" This concept is an apt spoof of the false authority of rock guidebooks, of how all musiccritics are selfappointed assbags, and of the fraudulent \"expertise\" (regarding not just music, but romance, parenting, etc.) holding forth from every magazine counter and bookstore shelf. Clontle admits to not being very knowledgeable, and has based his book on conversations he had in a coffee shop in Lawrence, Kansas, and while visiting his grandmother in Gainesville, Florida. Clontle is disinterested (he has money on a basketball game in progress), his rationale is inconsistent, and he contradicts himself often, setting up the enraged callers to come across as righteous defenders (and provincialist snobs, when they malign Lawrence and Gainesville). While the stereotypical music fanatic can be a flinchy aesthete (one of the callers seems to find Clontle's taste indicted by his basketball prioritization, a classic dualist fallacy), the venom they unleash, and the passion with which they debate these pointless hierarchies, mirrors that of the armchair coaches/athletes on sports radio. More enraging than Clontle's inflammatory remarks about Bowie, Zappa, and Neil Young \"rotting,\" and Madness \"inventing ska\" is his manner of turning the other cheek as callers become more confrontational; he lowers his mousy voice and offers tidings such as \"keep rockin\" and \"enjoy the night.\" Wurster as Clontle is amazingly quick, reacting to every caller's diatribe hilariously, or relying on the book's overstated subtitle/slogan: \"It's The Ultimate ArgumentSettler.\" Of the six shows on Chain Fights, Beer Busts, And Service With A Grin, the funniest is \"The Gorch\". Roland Gorchnik\"63 years cool\" claims to have been the inspiration for Happy Days' Fonzie, and has written a selfhelp book. As the interview progresses, Gorch quickly reveals that he is a sociopath, not just a lovable hoodlum. This skit manages to skewer generation gaps, terminal adolescence, the seventies and eighties' love affair with a lobotomized version of the Eisenhower era, the patheticness of the almostfamous, the absurdity of \"celebrity advice\" tomes, and the elasticity of pop icons. Remember the Fonziecentric Weezer video, or the cartoons on which Fonzie appeared, Laverne And Shirley In The Army and Fonz And The Happy Days Gang, featuring the dog Mr. Cool, and Cupcake, girl from the future? It hits at how television softens America's underbelly wouldx92t a real Fonzie have been more drunk, more thieving, more violent, and treated women worse than Henry Winkler's hardly chivalric getoverhere fingersnapper? The Gorch is one of the machinefixated cretins Marx predicted; even his choice of weapons (pipes and chains) are talismans of the industrial revolution. The Gorch so represents an American scourge that he brags of beating up an entire \"baseball game.\" His homoerotic zeal for tussling with men (his band recorded a song called \"You=Beat Up\") and his motivational axioms (\"College is for weak babies\") are fuggin uproarious. Laugh long and hard at this relic from the \"good old days,\" code for when blacks had few civil rights. The other five shows on the set are worthwhile. \"Radio Hut\" sends up the invasive interrogations to which Radio Shack subjects their customers, as well as that chaix92s overpriced, subcuttingedge products. If you ever detected something ominous, something justabouttosnap in the electronics store that feels like a shoe store, you'll find \"Radio Hut\" a riot. \"The Music Scholar\" regards those AriFleischersmarmy recordgeeks who namedrop as if their lives depend on it. This guest is a manifestation of elitismasbrutality, reporting that he chastises customers of his store until they are in tears. The Stooges were \"his thing\" at age ten, and then he dug Mauve, preBig Star demos, rare Can, and Harry Partch. To him, the Residents and The Fall are \"teenyboppers.\" \"Citizens For A True Democracy\" is almost not funny; the show involves a CEO Jr. who headed an OliverStonestyle cabal to ensure Bush's election. Though his arguments with stoned callers yield nervous chuckles, this preboxcutter bit comes too close to summoning the unitedfront teetotalitarians who now run a majority of our government. \"Mike Healy\" teeters on misunderstood small talk that gets blown exponentially out of proportion; this segment, though inventive, bears much in common with the quotidiandread humor of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm, or his headier episodes of Seinfeld.  These CDs reward repeat plays, even if Scharpling seems a little pent or vaudevillehokey in his \"straight man\" role, biding time and repeating the setups of punchlines. Offering listeners the voyeuristic thrill of the hoax but without stooping to cruelty, these radio shows would spice up a mean mix CD, or could work to combat the silence on that night when you and your friend/lover begin to take each other for granted, lacking the will to even speak.
