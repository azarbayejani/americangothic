{"label":" Kanine","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/17478/homepage_large.0c544fa4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Evan Minsker","artist":"Xray Eyeballs","title":"Splendor Squalor","text":" \"They cleaned up their sound.\" \"This album is more focused than the last one.\" \"They added band members, so the songs are fuller.\" All of those statements apply to Splendor Squalor, which is a good thing, right? Xray Eyeballs' debut, Not Nothing, hinted that the band could head in a few directions, so if O.J. San Felipe and Carly Rabalais wanted to fill out their sound, polish the fidelity, and reach for one genre instead of trying out a few, that's a good move. If this sophomore album is evidence of anything, it's that they picked one approach and ran with it: new wave steeped in hollow, jangling synths. It's a look they wore well on parts of Not Nothing, so they could theoretically pull off an album full of it. Sonically, the aesthetic honing works. Their percussion is more cleareyed and controlled than ever, thanks to new drummer Sarah Baldwin. The synths, from Liz Lohse, bring a welcome new layer to the mix that fills out their sound. The band's octaveseparated vocals work well with their new sheen, especially on \"Blue\", where they're especially tight. The case could be made that the jangle and the synths are overly reminiscent of Eyeballs' swooning, 1980s forebears, sure, but since they make up the most dreamy and pleasant moments of Splendor Squalor, it's hard to care. Execution isn't the problem. The main issue here is that when they find a sound they like, they bury themselves in it. For instance, they ruin perfectly good hooks by singing, \"Downtown is such a drag!\" (\"Gator\") or \"I control you! You control me!\" (\"X\") on nearinfinite repeat, to the point that those phrases come to mean nothing. It's made worse by the overall lack of variation in tempo and tone. Each song drags it's amazing the record's only 40 minutes long and it all culminates in \"Summer Daze\", an excruciating fiveminute monotone listing of summertime imagery, including tacos, snow cones, pubes, and DJ Pauly D. Really. Perhaps most telling is that the best song on the album is a cover of a song by Rabalais and San Felipe's other band, Golden Triangle. \"Cold Bones\" gets a shiny newwave makeover, but despite its status as a Splendor Squalor highlight, it's not as powerful as the original. The Golden Triangle cut has grit in its comparatively cruddy production; this new version has a fresh coat of jangling gloss. Worse is the drum sound, which is brittle compared to the original's robust, powerful drive. \"Four\"'s chorus of, \"Take your time, blissful night, big brown eyes, never die/ And fall apart, from the start, lost in love, and have some fun,\" is telling: There's so much love and fun and whimsy here, but it takes forever to deliver. The title Splendor Squalor invokes having a wonderful time despite your poor economic, hygienic, or social condition. That message would've been more effective with editing. Between a few of their choruses and that final tortuous laundry list of summertime activities, fun has never sounded quite so exhausting. "}
