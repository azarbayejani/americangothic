But when it comes to mashups, such wordplay has lost all of its charm. In fact, a punnedout title can now act as an active deterrent for listeners. James Drake a halfhour mix that combines the songs and sounds of, yes, James Blake and Drake is an exception to the lamename rule. This is even more impressive since the twentysomething Philadelphia producers/DJs behind it, Bombé (Tim Shaw) and Mr. Caribbean (Luis Angel Cancel), started with the title. \"Luis is constantly thinking up punbased ideas like this,\" wrote Shaw in an email, \"and the James Drake concept was just too perfect.\" The match really is wellsuited beyond rhyming monikers, in part because Drake and Blake are both masters at the art of loneliness. Along with his righthand producer Noah \"40\" Shebib, Drake has perfected the afterparty comedown; he's moody, he's drunk, and he desperately needs to talk to someone about about how he's getting vertigo from being at the top. Blake, of course, is a bit more elusive and introverted in his confessionals, but the core sentiment is similarly down and wary. There's not a huge gap between Blake singing, \"I don't know about my dreamin' anymore/ All that I know is I'm fallin' falin' fallin',\" and Drake's, \"What am I afraid of?/ This is supposed to be what dreams are made of.\" Both artists' uneasy sense of disillusionment cuts deep. Not only did Shaw and Cancel pick a wisely likeminded duo, they treat their creation more like a DJ mix than a traditional mashup. This isn't just 30 minutes of Drake verses pasted over Blake's willowy keyboards and stuttering bass. Both music and vocals are cherrypicked from each artist, and the mix is Blakeheavy, with Drake's unmistakable hum buzzing in on only a few tracks. And even when we do hear the rapper, his voice is often slowed down or fucked up; Shaw and Cancel manipulate Drake's vocals the same way James Blake often messes with his own croon, resulting in an even more symbiotic pairing. On \"Fear Logic Freestyle\", Drake is screwed as he repeats, \"Gotta lift the doors/ Blades choppin' through the city streets/ Liquid swords\" close your eyes tight enough and it's not hard to imagine the same passage showing up on a legit Blake release (give or take a GZA reference). It's hard to tell where Drake ends and Blake begins. The men behind James Drake also shy away from simply pimping out their subjects' hits, instead seeking more natural combinations. \"Fall for Your Man at 9 a.m.\" gets its pulse from the Blake obscurity \"Give a Man a Rod\", while Drake's early mixtape collaboration with Lil Wayne, \"Ransom\", is used to backbone highlight \"Ransom Money Youth\". Shaw and Cancel also use effects and processing to smear the lines between songs, and they add a touch of original production to the mix, though, according to Shaw, \"We tried to keep it minimal as far as major edits and let the two different voices speak for themselves.\" Along the way, we learn just how little difference there is between those voices; James Drake's title might be facepalmworthy, but its execution is anything but.
