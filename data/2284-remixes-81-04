R. Kelly's brilliant \"Ignition (Remix)\" was selfaware, witty, eminently danceable, and unerringly fun in short, everything the original \"Ignition\" was not. Kelly proved to John Barthlovin' metageeks what pop and dance fans already knew: that remixes can, in fact, be more accessible and successful than the original singles and album cuts. Kelly broke the mold; with Remixes 8104, Depeche Mode take credit for setting it. Yes, there's finally someone to blame for \"Beetlebum (Moby's Minimal House Mix)\" and Bush's Deconstructed! \"The remix story of Depeche Mode can be viewed as a history of the remix,\" Paul Morley crows in the liner notes, perhaps forgetting the whole of Jamaican music. But as this sprawling threedisc set attests, DM's relationship with the remix from the 12inches of the band's putative Vince Clarke years to a new collaboration with one of the CroMagnons in Linkin Park is both longterm and encompasses everything from electrodub to extended dance remixes to hiphop to house. It stands to reason, then, that this compilation is frustratingly scattershot. Collectors may salivate over Adrian Sherwood's white noiseladen mix of \"Master and Servant\" (previously available only on a rare 1984 vinyl release), but casual fans who, incidentally, would otherwise be well advised to stay the fuck away might enjoy Air's typically chilledout \"Home\" or the first five minutes of DM's own 1987 reworking of \"Never Let Me Down Again\". On the other hand, anyone with ears should avoid Danny Tenaglia's 12minute \"I Feel Loved\", with its heavyhanded beats and endless echoey repetitions of the title lyric. In some cases, this record reminds us how technologically far remixes have come from the days of simply splicing and extending a song's break or adding a heavier foot to its bass (see: Daniel Miller's fine but rudimentary 1981 \"Just Can't Get Enough\" remix). Other extended 12inches don't fair as well: \"Get the Balance Right\" is stretched like a Navigator with unremarkable instrumentals, and uberproducer Flood piles the worst elements of sophistipop balladry onto \"A Question of Lust\". Thankfully, at least a few of the remixes add some interesting twists, mirroring the shift over the past two decades toward artists using a remix to transform an original recording rather than just tweak it. DJ Shadow augments the emotional entreaty of \"Painkiller\" with classic soul samples and driving bass. Dave Clarke's \"Dream On\" builds upon gentle acoustic guitar arpeggios and fake strings with nary a hint of the original. A mix of \"In Your Room\" by Johnny Dollar and Portishead scratches and smolders like vintage mid1990s triphop (it was released in 1994, after all). Not all of the more transformative remixes succeed, however. Although DJ Muggs' \"Freelove\" mix is ultimately flawed, its hardedged, guitarbased approach offers a promising premise for future remixers why not dress DM's synthpop in the costumes of other genres until you find the right fit? Then there's the car crash at the end of the tunnel, Underworld's misguided \"Barrel of a Gun\" remix. I forget all my mid90s microgenre names, but there must be one for nine braindead minutes of windowrattling 180bpm drum loops. A limitededition third disc boasts the set's only new material. As with everything else here, it's a mixed bag: Rex the Dog provides a solid electrohouse update of early single \"Photographic\", Dave Gahan's lovely performance on \"Halo\" is gussied up by Allison Goldfrapp's accompanying vocals, and Ulrich Schnauss's \"Little 15\" is eerily sparse. The massive record concludes with \"Enjoy the Silence\" as \"reinterpreted\" by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda. Appearing on the band's 1990 masterwork Violator, the original single was an elegant, expressive take on an old theme, one familiar even to Gloria Estefan: \"Words Get in the Way\". But I'd take Miami Sound Machine over Shinoda's thuggish fauxrebellious thrash and his penchant for using Pro Toolsperfect guitar distortion that's as frigid as your exgirlfriend. \"Words are meaningless and regrettable,\" Gahan sings, and so is this remix in all of its antiseptic glory.
