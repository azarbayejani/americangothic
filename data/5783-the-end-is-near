Kadane seems to be taking his role as singer much more seriously these days in general, and I won't fault him for wanting to tighten the reins, since The New Year's debut differed so little from Bedhead's parting shot, 1998's Transaction de Novo, and arguably offered less substance. I won't hold him to the ghost of a band he and brother Bubba have, for whatever reason, decided to break from, but I will join in the chorus of critics who can't figure out the need for a new name, since the music sounds exactly the same, more than ever, on The End Is Near. A diarist, often to a fault, Kadane's lyrics veer from depressed non sequiturs (\"I'd rather not even think/ If I have to think/ Inside this other world\") to sharp oneliners (\"The world has its legs spread in front of me\") and gloriously simple rock refrains like, \"Do you feel inspired?/ I'm not fired up/ There's no motive in misery.\" His mixed bag of dramatic caveats direct The New Year, which is the only notable difference from his days fronting Bedhead, where such scratchpad poetry won us over from beneath an avalanche of threeguitar melodies. As Bedhead hollowed out their sound late in life, focusing on pointtopoint structure rather than the swelling anthems of old, Kadane's pensive delivery came too close to that of The For Carnation's Brian MacMahon. It's taken some time for The New Year to establish themselves against such postrock pigeonholes, and, perhaps as it should be, they've found their way out via the inexplicably unique sound they started out with.The End Is Near begins on the wrong foot, frontloading itself with its three most dramatic departures, and leading with an unmistakable Elliott Smith memorial, \"The End Is Not Near\". You could argue that any gravelyvoiced man in his thirties will sound something like Smith with his vocals doubled, but, the melodies are too referential here. Relying on acoustic guitars, reverb leads and the record's most sugary vocal production, the summery \"Sinking Ships\" and \"Chinese Handcuffs\" seem to point toward a very different direction than anyone familiar with Bedhead or The New Year might expect. But \"Plan B\" quickly hammers that door closed, and functionally restarts the album, which from here on out draws heavily from Bedhead's last two albums (Beheaded and Transaction de Novo), delivering exactly what the band's audience expected of 2001's Newness Ends. An offtempo teaser, \"Plan B\" is signature Kadane/Kadane, replete with climbing guitar lead, washedout choruses and a dramatically staged finale. Given the misdirection of The End Is Near's opening movement, \"Plan B\" announces a curious hint of nostalgia that's fully confirmed in \"Disease\", a mirrorimage of (and sequel to) Transaction de Novo's \"More Than Ever\". The Kadanes move through their back catalog with you during the wideopen \"Age of Conceit\", and the song's finale, mentioned earlier, makes for shared resolution, a straightahead barrechord progression laying plain their inability to break with what they know. By the time the overlong jam \"18\" gets underway, one gets the sense the end really is near: Whatever excitement this album lends is, for the most part, borrowed by its preexisting audience, and it's clear the Kadanes aren't going to challenge us. There's nothing wrong with staying the course, but after ten years down this road, to find the Kadane brothers have ended up where they began makes for a bittersweet homecoming. I raised my glass, but it was a sad smile. "}
