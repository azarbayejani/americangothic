Since notoriously recording his first album from behind a fencing mask, Ghostface Killah has spent his solo discography facing tracklisting errors, guest appearances from subpar MCs, and a quest for commercial acceptance that's netted him exactly zero Top 40 singles. It would seem high time for Coles to shrug off label expectations, focus on pleasing his fanbase, and finally escape the spectre of his financial shortcomings.Where the solo releases of so many WuTang alumni have suffered from lagging production, or seemed naked without backup from fellow Clan members, Ghostface has managed to cultivate a unique sound and identity apart from his former crew on the strength of his own technical merit. Still among the rap game's finest, Ghostface possesses one of history's most malleable flows: he growls, screams, sputters, speeds up, stumbles, coos, whispers, croons, pleads, cries, and indulges in onomatopoeia sometimes all in the same song. Considering this distinct style, the quality of his albums has always been relative to his subject matter. Here, he assumes the role of Do the Right Thing's Radio Raheem: one fist spells \"HATE\", the other \"LOVE.\"\"Beat the Clock\"'s strings hit like a right hook, as producer Minnesota (best known for Mos Def's \"Beef\") throws down an unchanging blaxploitation funk loop that keeps in line with the minimalist backing of Ghost's best work. Taking advantage of the open space, Ghost styles like crazy, arguing with himself between verses and periodically switching to a singsong cadence. Quotables pop up all over the place here from scenes that have him \"hopping over chairs like O.J.\" to straight disses like \"get off my DI, then go C the K\") but the track's most stunning line has Ghost pushing opulence through the creative threshold: \"I put my ring up to my man's waves/ I seen the ocean.\"On the other end of the spectrum is \"Save Me Dear\", a selfproduced throwback sampling Ghostface's own Supreme Clientele highlight \"Child's Play\" and Jam Master Jay's cavernous 808 beats, and bears a surprisingly resemblance to MF Doom's recent work. An open plea to womankind, Ghost offers a testament to true thug love, asserting, \"We mad tight, in the way she never call the cops on a nigga,\" and rallying, \"To all the ladies who love they man/ Though they fucked up and you still let 'em back in.\"Of course, as is customary with Wu rappers, Ghost sometimes makes missteps in the name of personal preference. There are cases in which Ghost allows his oldschool heart and love for homage obscure or detract from the quality of his music (or album cover witness the sad Photoshop hackjob paying tribute to Doug E. Fresh's 1988 classic The World's Greatest Entertainer). Yet, The Pretty Toney Album remains incredibly ontarget otherwise, with uniformly stunning production work that feels like a ramshackle Blueprint. From the short sample chop and fourbar horn flourish of \"Be This Way\", to True Master's paused piano and fuzz saxophone drum stomp on \"Biscuits\", to the fearsoaked, twistedhorn chase music of \"Run\", Pretty Toney evokes hiphop's storied past even while its polish and gloss reveal its 2004 release date.Expectedly, minor shortcomings hold the record back from classic status. The lack of his usual obligatory Raekwon collaboration hurts Pretty Toney's variety, and the skits, despite featuring topics and idiosyncratic raps far above the standards of his contemporaries, tend to bog down the album's progress. I'm also disappointed by the exclusion of mixtape tracks \"Gorilla Hood\", \"The Splash\", and \"My Guitar\", which could have offered the record a better batting average. But all things considered, Pretty Toney far surpasses 2001's Bulletproof Wallets, finally finding the missing link between street cred and commercial respect. "}
