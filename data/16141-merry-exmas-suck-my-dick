Because Bad Santa would've been too obvious a title for this raunchy yet immensely likable antisocialite? Or maybe eXquire likes a nonsequitur blowjob joke far more than the next guy and also needs to figure out a way to create timeliness for this thing, seeing as it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Christmas. Either way, it's a fitting way for eXquire to end the year after all, he finished 2011 with a much bigger profile than he began it with, and if this is your first exposure to the guy's work, he got there making about as many artistic concessions as you'd expect from a guy with the word \"Muthafuckin'\" in his name. It's a worthy cause for celebration. eXquire still maintains a huge chip on his shoulder and a related lack of patience for rappers \"doing their best Yeezy rendition\" and supplicating at the behest of internet tastemakers a line like \"Books by Marcus Garvey/ Skin swarthy/ Snuff the glitter off your Ed Hardy/ Honey BBQ strips from Hardee's and two 40s/ Bet I finish them shits before I get to my apartment\" from \"The Gold Watch\" serves as a tidy syllabus for eXquire's worldview, equally inspired by timehonored alcohol abuse, budgetary restrictions, and a general disdain for others. But Merry eXmas isn't stoked by the same struggle and desperation of Lost in Translation, and the relatively lighthearted vibe is pretty much necessary since it asks a lot of the listener: It's essentially an outtakes collection from a mixtape, albeit one that, for all intents and purposes, felt like a labelfunded debut. Nonetheless, eXquire remains remarkably sharp, taking more chances indulging in pure technical showmanship, celebrating freedom from traditional song structure in the form of 90second trials on \"What's Beef\" (\"Biggie Tribute\") and A$AP Rocky's \"Peso\" (\"R.I.P. Payso\", credited to \"one of them A$AP niggaz I forgot\"), while a \"backwards\" verse on \"Two 22's b/w Twenty Two 2's\", doubletime flows, and fake patois all fold into eXquire's haughty, smirking, knucklehead voice that finds the missing link between GUnit and Def Jux. If these really are the leftovers from Translation, it explains why nothing quite leaps out at you like \"Huzzah\" or its remix it does reappear in name only as a glassyeyed reinterpretation that does away with the hook entirely, but eXquire and company make Merry eXmas too much of a blast to really concern oneself with the stakes involved. \"Two 22's b/w Twenty Two 2's\" might've gotten there had it not been padded out to sixandahalf minutes by a \"Pretty Boy Swag\" parody and audio vérité from a roundtable discussion of cunnilingus. Those things do have their place on mixtapes, but the decision to jam them right into the most obvious banger is an encapsulation of Merry eXmas' pleasures and faults. There are far more of the former than the latter, though. As if you had to ask, \"Killah Tofu\" indeed samples the Beets (\"Doug\" version) and spends the rest of its run time forgetting it did pretty much anyone who gets on a track with Danny Brown these days holds on for dear life, but eXquire plays a worthy foil by sounding like the gulliest dude to ever quote Harvey Danger. With beats from the Legendary Mr. Len and ElP, this is still very much in the Def Jux wheelhouse, familiar enough with funk and boombap to know how it can be defiled for their own purposes, but also a reminder of a time when \"underground\" and \"backpack\" hiphop didn't necessarily represent a limp, aggressionfree version of it. It's what often has him viewed against his will as a torchbearer for New Yorkcentricity, but he treats it like an actual physical place rather than some sort of mythic construct of hiphop purity he announces \"Stella Artois and sour cream Utz\" as pillars of his diet and by the end, he's probably namedropped 95% of his local bodega's inventory. He's certainly pliable as a voice and a personality, but the lesser experiments start piling up toward the backend lurching cokerap that channels Jeezy circa 2005 (\"Nightmare on Fed Street\"), \"Drunken Freestyle\" pretty much living up to its name, and the highNRG bootybass tribute (\"Power U Pt. 2\") that takes a big rip of Boris S.'s \"Don't You Wanna Pussy Ride\" and is the filthiest thing eXquire has put to tape (which is saying something). Yet Merry eXmas can be considered a continuation of Translation in how \"Power U Pt. 2\" completely makes sense in relation to something like the track \"S.C.U.M.\" Few artists in any genre, let alone hiphop, are making rawer and realer breakup songs than eXquire, and \"S.C.U.M.\" is his most despondent yet, never asking for sympathy or justification in his actions (\"I was numb to the experience/ Jerked my head back every time she tried to give me kisses\").  Sure, on the very next track he's bragging about his \"lesbian broad who only fucks me\" and stewing over an impromptu orgy spoiled by a pal's wedding ring and a Charles Oakley Topps trading card (it makes sense in context, trust), but it doesn't contradict eXquire so much as humanize him as someone trying to reconcile the instinct to be the better man while making and being a fan of morally reprehensible hiphop. And really, that's indicative of how eXquire's magnetism as an MC is much like Danny Brown's, even though as rappers, their styles are wholly complementary rather than similar outside of a tremendous appetite for women and drugs. You leave their music feeling that there really isn't much of a separation between what they're saying and what they're living. "}
