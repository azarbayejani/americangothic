Any Minute Now got good enough marks but damn did it bomb big for me, especially since its cranky leadoff single \"NY Excuse\" was in arm's reach of \"Yeah\" in 2004's punkfunk marathon. Soon word of Duran Duranrepping \"Nite Versions\" of AMN tracks fluttered about selfdone electro retakes fitted for the floor but still uncompromisingly rock and a few popped up on that punchdrunk Radio 1 broadcast mix the 2manyDJs brothers did for the BBC back in January. When the NV'd \"Krack\" slowed down summer jams to slurry, breaking up the BPMs like \"Jamrock\" did in hiphop sets, I had a feeling: A whole album of this shit and we'd have a cruder, crunchier Homework. Figures, Soulwax lead off NV with a cover of Daft Punk's \"Teachers\", names changed for a who's who of dancerock forefathers (which to my chagrin, includes the goddamn the Who). In the vein of \"AC/DC aren't a metal band, they're a dance band,\" \"Miserable Girls\" grinds hard enough to get on one of those XGames comps, seering guitar lead and convicted vox trapped interminably in echo. Still these are tracks before newwave anthems, breakdowns before makeup, with emphasis on the vertical and the power of repetition. Even the vocal hooks are kept to snippets: \"It's not you, it's the e talking,\" or \"compute it!\" or once is enough, \"James Brown is dead.\" Like for Munk or LCD Soundsystem, the authority (or something) of live sound plays a part in the NV lure, but Soulwax never overstate. When the comicbookishly dark holds on \"Slowdance\" give out for the bridge, those sixteenths on the high hat effect a lot on their own; \"I Love Techno\" benefits from heavyhanded drum pounds that hold back the song's twitter and Blondie bassline; the legendary \"NY Lipps\" mash between \"NY Excuse\" and \"Funky Town\" speaks for itself. These are simple tracks, sure, confident enough to lay their soundmakers bare (and vice versa), but such staunch antipussyfooting/antimysticism makes Soulwax a bit more democratic, palpable too. They play what's humanly possible for a quartet, and in fact, rumor has it they may even be playing these nite versions live in Philadelphia at the NYE Making Time party. And if they play NVs trackfortrack, as they're peerlessly mixed on the CD, those minor strings that course tearyeyed closer \"Another Excuse\" won't drop the ball. "}
