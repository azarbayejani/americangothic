The first track from Flies the Fields is yet another diversion: \"Axons and Dendrites\" is a slowbuilder with a jaunty rhythm that only reveals a melody just before its abrupt finish. But, on the whole, Flies the Fields doesn't build on the experimentation of their three most recent EPs collected on ThreeFour. Instead, this record sounds like a step backward. The majority of Flies the Fields is bogged down by too much discipline. The guitar jangle of \"Louven\" is a bit flatfooted, and \"It's Not Too Late\" toes the line between tense and droning before crawling into the latter. The performances here are capable, but the melodies consistently interlock and drone, and the drums merely underline the crescendos. \"While songs like '(Morays or) Demons' may flirt with rocking out, the album feels like a jam session that was never edited or arranged into proper songs (\"proper\" being relative to the genre). The ominous, whispersung vocals, creeping bass, jangling guitars, and prodding drums have all been used to greater effect in countless other places heck, they've been pulled off better by the members of Shipping News themselves. Stranger still is that the songs with variation or texture are pushed to the end of the record. The final third of Flies rewards your patience: \"The Human Face\" starts slowly, drops off into silence, and returns with the album's most spirited, rocking performance and stopstart precision from the rhythm section. \"Untitled w/Drums\" features a truly stunning melody sung by overlapping male and female vocals, and shows the band stepping out of the stiff roles they've been playing on Flies up until now. \"Untitled\" segues into the final \"Paper Lanterns\", a creepy, industrial throb that I'd label as an album highlight just as its original version was a highlight of the ThreeFour compilation. The new \"Paper Lanterns\" may be even more captivating than the original, but it could also be a warning sign that the Shipping News' collective pen is running dry. "}
