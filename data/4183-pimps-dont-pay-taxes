What are you like? What are some of your interests?  I feel so weird doing this! I usually have no problems meeting people in bars, but my friend dared me to try Pitchfork Personals, so here I am. But please, ladies, if you don't have a picture, don't bother replying. Beats are the number one priority in my life. If you like creative beats, you'll like me. Besides for beats, I also like Red Lobster, Lucy Liu and unprotected sex. Rhymes and lyrics are important, but I don't mind sharing I do it all the time with my friends Huggy and AlShid. But regardless of who's on the mic, the rhymes are raw (sex, underage sex, unprotected sex, and other variations on the theme), tight as shit, and damn funny (\"You make as much noise as En Vogue without Dawn\"). I don't care about being a hiphop purist. I don't care what hiphop is \"all about.\" I am about starting a fucking party. Maybe even a \"fucking party,\" if you give up some of that ass. Tell us about your sound:  Like I was saying before, beats mean so much to me. I need someone who can handle beats being number one in my life. They truly are my passion. The ladies tell me I have kind of an Automator thing going. Fuck that. I don't do that grandiosity and sophistication bullshit I'm about the ghetto and, if you're nice, I can be real playful. See, namedropping don't cut it with me. I'm unique. Check the blundering samples on \"Q&A;\" and \"Live from Pimp Palace East\" the carnival quality of something lifted from an episode of \"The Three Stooges\" or \"Keystone Cops.\" Girl, who does this? All I'm saying, the shit is dope. And I got more where that came from. Check \"The Bum Bitch Ballad.\" I'm all sampling strings and accordions, almost to where it brings up visions of a pastoral French landscape. But I don't wanna get too romantic about it, so I play it cool. We wanna have ourselves a good time, not a picnic lunch. So instead of a blanket and an amour, I litter the landscape with the world record for consecutive spokenword \"bitch\" samples. Take that, France! Even if the beat wasn't so good, the humor of the irony itself is a thing to behold. Later on the album, I get back to strings, but with a spin this time \"Fuckin' Up the Money\" (featuring Huggy) combines strings with a howling vocal background. Sounds stark, right, but primed for the dancefloor. Enjoy! How would your best friends describe you?  Well, maybe I've gained a reputation, but it's not as bad as it sounds: \"I went out on a date with that asshole [JZone] once. He took me to Red Lobster, and when the waiter came, he stuck me with the fucking check. He's just mad cuz I never gave him any play. Then he tried to talk to my sister a week later yeah, fuck JZone.\" (from \"JZone Fan Club\") Do you have any special talents?  I battle my talking dick (a.k.a. Thug Penis, played by Huggy on the ingenious \"The Trojan War\"). Last weekend, he got a little pissed that I insisted on unprotected sex: \"You better put a hat on my head, before I play dead/ Like I did the last time to get us both thrown out of bed.\" The prick went so far as to threaten me and my nuts with nonperformance: \"Even though we're the same age/ I'll cum premature and blame it on the balls.\" Why you should get to know me:  Y'all are looking for someone with an underground sound and serious street credibility (i.e. if they ever heard me, I would appeal to all motherfuckers). You're sick of MCs pontificating; you know that not every brother has a projectsized political chip on his shoulder, and not every one who doesn't is named Will Smith. So if you fine, baby, and you want a master player, write me back. For real. Im'a get up in that. "}
