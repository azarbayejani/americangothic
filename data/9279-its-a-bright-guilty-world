Without his connection to the Apples in Stereo's Robert Schneider, the reliable but understated brand of Ray Daviesinspired pop he creates in the Minders could very well have been lost in the mid90s lofi cassette avalanche. Leaper's songbook displays the requisite knowledge of the Kinks/Beatles catalogs required of all E6 applicants, but as the lone Brit in the collective, he's always been a bit of the odd man out his songwriting as plaintive as his peers' was whimsical. It's a Bright Guilty World is a typically unassuming affair, falling softly somewhere between the concision and clarity of Face to Faceera Kinks and the inthebedroom immediacy of Elliott Smith's X/O. Schneider plays a key supporting role on lead guitar and keyboard, but his mischievous exuberance and fuzzedup production style are reined in until the coda of track 12, \"357\", where the song's sitarlike guitar riff yields to an encroaching parade of booming bass drums. And though violins, electric guitar solos, organs, and horns make effective periodic appearances, It's a Bright Guilty World is first and foremost a showcase for Leaper's simple songwriting: direct glad/sad/mad emotions, breezy, unfussy melodies, linear acoustic arrangements, verse/chorus/verse/chorus and out. Which is to say, It's a Bright Guilty World is only as spirited as its performances, of which revvedup powerpop pleasers \"Accidental Joy\" and \"Same Time, Same Place\" (written by former Remy Zero drummer Louis Schefano and featuring the alltoo scarce backing vocals of partner Rebecca Cole) are the most engaging. But Leaper is a more captivating vocalist when he's not making nice: the exceptional \"Jenny\" introduces a welcome sense of tension and urgency (\"You love to see me down, don't you Jenny\") that distinguishes itself from the Minders' more congenial fare, and \"In the Middle of Your Love\" is a striking, solitary piano piece haunted by subliminal Mellotron swells.  Such glimpses into Leaper's heart of darkness (or, rather, heart of dimness) are few and fleeting. Where fellow secondgeneration E6 survivors Of Montreal stay true to the collective's playfully anarchic vision even as they incorporate more contemporary electro/disco elements, the Minders exist in a state of splendid isolation from the modern world, a proudly introverted feeling that permeates Leaper's modest songs. \"This time is going to pass me,\" he laments on the militaristic psychpop march \"Red Admirals\", but he doesn't sound like he's in a rush to get off his sofa and play catch up.
