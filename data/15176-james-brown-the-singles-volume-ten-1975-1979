Once so far ahead of all of his R&B contemporaries that every new single provoked an international scramble to figure out his new groove, he'd now settled into repeating himself \"Superbad, Superslick\" was a drained, brittle remake of his fouryearold single \"Super Bad\" or, worse, imitating his imitators. The minor hit \"Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved)\" was simply a hoarse JB lyric set to a notefornote ripoff of David Bowie's \"Fame\". From the first seven tracks on this volume of HipO's mailorder series which also include a pair of wretched doowop covers and two tedious versions of a University of Georgia football fight song you might guess that Brown's career was crashing and burning. (The lengthy funk jam \"Everybody Wanna Get Funky One More Time\", the final release on his People label, sounds like a farewell for which he's rousing whatever oomph he's got left.) But Brown had long since mastered the art of throwing off his cape and rushing back to the microphone just as he was being led offstage. \"I'm back!\" he declared at the beginning of \"Get Up Offa That Thing\", the first record on which he figured out how to integrate his vampandstab funk into the new disco sound. He was rewarded with a substantial hit, and followed it up with a few more dance records that were reasonably solid, if not quite groundbreaking: \"Bodyheat\", \"Give Me Some Skin\", \"The Spank\". Still, the old master wasn't quite at home in the new era compared to the freewheeling funk records he was making even a couple of years earlier, they were clenchedup and uncomfortable. So the fascinating stuff on Volume Ten is, for the most part, perversely fascinating. A soupy \"Love Me Tender\", recorded a few months after Elvis's death, begins with a little firsttake monologue: \"You knowoh, hi, this is James Brown. The Godfather of Soul? I wanna talk about a good friend...\" \"People Who Criticize\" (when artists come up with titles like that, you know there's a problem) isn't good, exactly, but it's bugging out with sheer spirit, including a bungled but vehement piano solo and a minute and a half of unhinged scat singing at the end. The Gershwin standard \"Summertime\" is one of the few times Brown's longtime backup singer Martha High ever got to step into the spotlightalthough, for Brown, it's an excuse to chatter about how \"I'm just so disgusted, because Mother Nature didn't intend for the things that are happenin'.\" And then there's \"For Goodness Sakes, Look at Those Cakes\", the most joyful and most ridiculous of his disco records an asswatcher's diary, at a much faster tempo than \"Hot Pants\". (Brown had evidently forgotten how to pull off slow funk.) When it stiffed, Polydor announced that either Brown would have to turn himself over to another producer, or they were done with trying to promote his rusty funk and soggy ballads to an audience that had moved on. The result was an album called The Original Disco Man an appeal to nostalgia and respectled by \"It's Too Funky in Here\", his first single with staying power in a few years. Produced by Brad Shapiro, it sounded like no James Brown record before it, slick, modern and rubbery. The voice on top of it retained its force and rasp and pouncing sense of rhythm: nothing could take those away. But the days of his old slogan, \"A James Brown Production The Sound of Success\", were gone for good.  Â  "}
