Delaware... I'm in Delaware.\" Well it's that same locale that hypnogogic Brooklyn indie poppers Small Black traveled to get started on their debut LP, New Chain. It's actually less of a headscratcher than you think. Recorded in suburban seclusion in the First State, Small Black selected the location in hopes to try and tap back into the kind of motifs that their selftitled debut EP established nostalgia and dreamdrunk melancholy chiefly among them. Unlike that ultrapersonal, demoquality introduction, New Chain marks the unveiling of a cleaner, more direct sound, thanks to the nowcemented fourpiece lineup and improved production.This isn't to say that that the band has shed the woozy, new wave vibe that got them lumped in with chillwave in the first place. New Chain doesn't make much of an attempt to skirt those signifiers, focusing more on electronics and rhythm. Most of the songs several of which could be classified as straightup ballads are very simply constructed, relying on details to elicit feeling through a myriad of synth textures and vocal layers. There's a pretty simple equation that can be applied: The more compelling the details are, the more compelling the song is. The syrupy funk lurch of \"Goons\", those lava lamp bell tones on \"Photojournalist\", the bouncy drum programming on \"Crisp 100s\" all are elements that elevate these very patient pop songs and make them memorable.Sometimes it's synthesized almost seamlessly. \"New Chain\" is both drowsy and insular, but a subtle, muted boogie and Josh Kolenik's vocal melody help lodge it into your head in ways that a flat track like the tryingly plain \"Light Curse\" can't. Small Black are often at their best when they can either make you move or get you to feel or remember something it's no wonder why \"Despicable Dogs\", a single from that first EP that managed to do both, is their most beloved. \"New Chain\", with it's gorgeous smattering of vivid synth patterns, is \"Despicable Dogs\" reupholstered: It still feels like a sunrise bike ride with a head full of weed, but this time in fullblown technicolor.
