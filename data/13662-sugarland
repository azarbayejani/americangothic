Echoes of No Waveera noisemakers particularly the dogmatic rants of Lydia Lunch's Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and the urgent abstractions of Ut were unmistakable. But the duo also has firm roots in the present New York underground, specifically the noiserock of veteran trio Sightings, whose Richard Hoffman guested on Secret Cog's best track, \"33\".Not long after that debut, Talk Normal signed to Rare Book Room Records, enabling them to record their first LP, Sugarland, with producer and labelowner Nicolas Vernhes. This has naturally brought an increase in clarity and detail, but the band's propensity for thick noise and rhythmic tension hasn't waned. In fact, the essential grit and guts of their music have deepened. Songs and lyrics remain simple most tracks feature a repetitive beat and blunt statements like \"You had it coming,\" \"Don't shut me down,\" and, aptly enough, \"I believe in structure.\" But the way the pair rides these patterns to bracing climaxes is deft and relentless. And their eerie horrormovie tone has grown, approaching the cavernous territory first dug out by the early dirges of Sonic Youth and Swans.That heavy atmosphere relies on Register's diverse, textured guitar, which is like a muscle stretched across the skeleton of Ambro's beats. She often begins songs with minimal chords, but soon morphs them into layered blare that sounds like Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo inhabiting one body or, perhaps more accurately, a multidimensional take on Lunch's spraying blasts. On strident pieces like \"In a Strangeland\" and \"Bold Face\", her churning noise matches the duo's coolly desperate howls. Later, her seesawing treble on \"Transmission Lost\" adds hopeful swing to the callandresponse. And her guitar is the clear star of \"River's Edge\", a kind of \"Death Valley '69\" update that slowly loses its strict beat, indicating the duo can loosen up their rhythmic lockstep when they want to.In fact, you can hear seeds of expansion on the four tracks that follow \"River's Edge\". \"Uniforms\" offers a ragalike guitar figure; Ambro's drumming on \"Warrior\" has a digital crunch not far from slowburn IDM; and \"Outside\" features a wiry, scraping saxophone. But it's on Sugarland's best track a cover of Roxy Music's \"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\" where Talk Normal stretches farthest. Opening with three minutes of beatific synth and halfspoken vocals, the duo follows the original's ultimate line \"but you blew my mind\" not with glam bombast, but muscular, stomping noise. It sounds less like Roxy Music than the Velvet Underground, particularly the moment when Lou Reed used the declaration \"and then my mind split open\" to throw \"I Heard Her Call My Name\" into overdrive. Talk Normal may not yet possess VUlevel power, but the fact that they can even evoke such magic practically guarantees a promising future. "}
