{"label":" Fat Beats","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/12430/homepage_large.4df7120e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Elzhi","title":"The Preface","text":" So an MC who's been recording for over a decade, appeared on three albums and a mixtape as part of Slum Village, and released a topnotch, buzzedabout tour CD earlier this year goes and calls his newest album The Preface, like he hasn't even started the first chapter and spent his whole career using roman numerals as page numbers. But it's a pretty good sign when the most disingenuous thing about an album is its title, as though Elzhi's solo debut were some kind of explanatory introduction for an unknown rather than a wellbuilt veteran effort at the top of a very long resumé and even then, he acknowledges and expands that contradiction in the album's intro track (\"This is only a beginning/ Everything I've been in is included, though\").The other crux of that brief intro track is that the radio sucks, people don't know what real hiphop is, water's wet, etc. But after you've listened to The Preface more than once the standard antiindustry complaints sound more and more like a defiant leadin for a legitimately independentminded, focusgroupaverse piece of work. Elzhi's one of those cats who's great at the whole headnod/battle underground \"rapping about rapping\" thing, and no matter how shitty the industry gets it seems like there's never a shortage of seriously lyricalminded MCs flying under the radar. It's just that he's especially good at it, able to cover ground as an acrobaticflowing wordtwister, a highconcept storyteller, and a tellitlikeitis everyman.Elzhi displays these strengths clearly over The Preface's hourandchange running time: he's got a couple of sharp gimmick tracks that tweak language fluidly, like the baitandswitch wordsplitting of \"Guessing Game\" (\"They claim they the best/ Hey, you ask me, I say maybe they were OK, yes.../ terday\"), the GZAstyle Crayolabox exercise \"Colors\" (\"Got them boys in blue with blackjacks locking the new youth/They sell purples through Blackberries with the Bluetooth\"), or the second verse of \"D.E.M.O.N.S.\", where he spits out strings of alliterative lines without getting in the way of clarity. But even if most of the tracks are of the verbally gymnastic, bigupself mold other highlights being the fiery Royce Da 5'9\" collab \"Motown 25\" and the Detroit underground allstar \"Fire (Remix)\"  there's also a warmth here that most other semiunderground lyricallyricist rapping machines keep tucked away. You can hear a shining gratitude in the flossing of \"Brag Swag\", pure lovestruck bliss in \"Transitional Joint\", and the autobiographical \"Growing Up\" where, like many MCs, he states that hiphop saved his life, but throws in enough details on his family and his neighborhood upbringing to help it ring true.And Black Milk's production has a lot to do with this humanity, too: postDilla resplendence, manifested as midnight gospel (\"Brag Swag\") and seething, subterranean boombap (\"Hands Up\"). It's tight enough to help me forgive the minor case of hotverseflathook syndrome that seems to crop up in lyricallyfocused albums like this, and given that the Elzhi/Black Milk partnership brings enough variety and energy over the course of The Preface to make it that rare 16track CD where nothing feels expendable, it's easy to look forward to the possibility of a smallscale but strong dynasty. Couple this with the aforementioned tour CD Europass (which it shares a few tracks with), and you've got some of the year's most vital underground hiphop: this isn't just an introduction, it's the start of a new phase and hopefully this one will reach an audience that desperately needs it.
