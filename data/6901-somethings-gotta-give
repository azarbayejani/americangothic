They also, in representing a disenchanted sect of the hiphop underground, have a fresh message, fractured and unpolished though it may be. Vocalist Kimani is the most important variable in determining your reaction to the group's fulllength debut, Something's Gotta Give. His style here is nofrills, mixing a steady, monotonous delivery with straightforward lyrics that at least until his content hits you give him the presence of any generic indie emcee. His tendency to opt for either idiosyncratic humor or emotional poignancy gives his flow an immediacy that lends itself to a more identifiable persona, and recalls more introspective artists like MURS and Slug. His topical breadth, meanwhile, runs the gamut from tales of the infamous friendship zone (\"The Line\"), to dealing with depression and sleeping issues (\"Insomnia 411\" with Jean Grae and Slug), to the various problems inherent in society (\"Troublearth\"). Suffice to say: those expecting a verbal firestorm will want to turn elsewhere. But one attribute that separates Kimani's character from others is his obvious rock influences. \"Timmy\" lifts its chorus from Primus' \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\"; \"A Meditation on Why Love Sucks\" opens with Kimani crooning lines from Leadbelly's \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\", and the skit \"I Am So Rich\" samples \"Art Star\" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Most overt are the consistent Nirvana references: Kimani speaks of \"nightmares with wrists slit, smashed through the windowpanes/ I woke up in cold sweats with visions of Kurt Cobain,\" gets robbed at an ATM by Kurt Loder over a loop of \"Scentless Apprentice\", and, most interestingly, happens to be a depressed Pisces, disillusioned with the most popular pillars of his genre. It's a parallel that adds an interesting dimension to otherwise uninspired music. Regardless of some issues with his lessthanspectacular flow, Kimani is still one to bring a burner when it comes to more tradrap issues. \"New Jack City\" melds the production sensibilities of Little Johnny from the Hospitul with Kimani's pleasant drone for one of the most addictive tracks of the year. Sporting a jagged railroad blues smasher, he admonishes the new guard of underground hiphop, claiming to be \"from a time when cats wore hats that fit/ And when beef would ever kettle, it gets settled with fists.\" He also manages to hold a spotlight on artists: \"Dr. Seuss raps/ Cat in the Hat/ Where you just fill in the blanks and get a pat on the back/ Then a platinum plaque.\" Unfortunately, there are some inconsistencies with the production. Although the liners say it comes courtesy of both members (mostly Mr. Len), Kimani's hitandmiss traditional loop style is radically disparate with Mr. Len's ruggedly eccentric, electronic beat masonry. Some triumphs show through the lofi Buddy Slimesque dreamscape of \"Troublearth\", the raw keyboard catwalk of \"The Line\" and the warped synth and distorted screams of \"Maybe\", but the majority of the album's production is either too convoluted (the dry piano sample and corny drum arrangement of \"Insomnia 411\") or unpleasantly arrhythmic (the jagged, awkward keyboard nodes and offbeat drums of \"Lately\"). Despite their questionable production choices, uninspired topics, and spotty sound quality, Roosevelt Franklin's future remains bright. If Kimani can tilt his delivery to more varied cadences and Mr. Len can contain his desire for innovation that too often results in awkward tracks, this young New York duo shows the potential of channeling their obvious talents into a more accessible product.
