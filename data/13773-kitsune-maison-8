{"label":" Kitsuné","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/14807/homepage_large.949f79fc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Kitsuné Maison 8","text":" The Parisbased Kitsuné label has diverse tastes that can only be encompassed by the large \"indiedance\" tent. Its aesthetic is built on a bedrock of retro house and future disco. It tends to like the flashy, upbeat, and stylish; the play of wiry digital sequences against brightly buffed analog electronics or sculpted guitars; popculture nostalgia and ingenuous goodlife anthems. Its catalog leaves plenty of room for electropop, indie rock, and indefinable leftfield music, provided that it has a certain chic air, polished production, and at least a toe on the dance floor. It's eclectic, but not in a haphazard way: Wherever cool people make music for other cool people to dance to, remix, and recognize while boutiqueshopping, Kitsuné is there.Despite this variety, the makeup of their compilations is remarkably consistent. They always contain one or two rising stars (prior installments caught Phoenix, Hot Chip, Klaxons, and Bloc Party at ideal moments), some killer tracks that are either too techno or too weird to get really popular, and a bunch of stuff that would at least perk up your ears on \"Gossip Girl\" or at Urban Outfitters. This installment is no exception. Memory Tapes' \"Bicycle\" fills the breakout slot while he's unlikely to go on to Phoenixcaliber stardom, he's one of the signal acts of the emergent glofi genre. A couple of other standout tracks also get in on the endless summer that was 2009. French Horn Rebellion's \"Up All Night\" is a great opener irresistible, panting synthpop, with fat new wave key tones and ecstatic vocals. And the Drums' \"Let's Go Surfing\", a delicious \"Young Folks\"meets\"Misirlou\" bon bon, maintains its winking yet earnest 50s feel flawlessly; the \"down by the rollercoaster\" break is especially contrived and convincing. They're like a Kitsuné version of Surfer Blood, with mannered aesthetics standing in for messy abandon.There are a number of entries in the coolbutobscure camp this year. Siriusmo's \"High Together\" is an exciting ride cosmic disco that swoops down into hairraising minor keys, as if Pantha du Prince had designed the music for Space Mountain. Le Corps Mince de Françoise's funky oddpop number \"Something Golden\" sounds like something Micachu might have cobbled together, with boltaction percussion accents and barnyard vocals. Slagsmålsklubben's brainy \"Brutal Weapons\" plinks and mangles like a techhouse kalimba, with lots of shapely pitchbends. Promising new signing Delphic offer the forthcoming single \"This Momentary\", a streaming, dreamy electropop track with a blatantly emotional appeal. Midnight Juggernaut's \"This New Technology\" is an interesting wild card, a big blowsy guitar anthem with those ubiquitous zippering scales (hey, more glofi signifiers!) tracing icy whorls in the chorus. And Heartsrevolution's \"Dance Till Dawn\", a vocoderglazed 80s flashback that's all neon reflected in chrome, swaggers persuasively. These tracks testify to the label's range, although the handful of negligible ones point out its limitations even turbocharged sparkle can get played out at length.There's nothing truly bad here, although Crystal Fighters' tweaky \"I Love London\", which seems to be trying to vibrate its own frame off, might set your teeth on edge if you catch it in the wrong moment. But some tracks just dissolve into a sugary, distractedly pleasurable sense of conspicuous consumption and wanton eightieshumping. The remixes aren't very exciting this time around Harvard Bass' version of Beni's \"Maximus\" has a hot bass line and not much else. Ditto for Moulinex's remix of Two Door Cinema Club's \"I Can Talk\". Alex Kapranos turns in the best retrofit: A widescreen take on Chew Lips' \"Salt Air\", beaming with revelatory synths. And there's little to be said for \"Control\", Nottee's mildly dull Italotropical plodder, or \"I Am the Sound\", My Tiger My Timing's winsome electrofunk closer, except that they keep the urban bon vivant aura intact for a little while longer. Kitsuné Maison 8 lacks the insane highs of some prior comps, but its consistency testifies to the label's ongoing vitality. "}
