I mean, I know who he is he's the most ubiquitous little bald man this side of Verne Troyer. I meant, who is he, really? Because years of pop culture brainwashing have created a caricature of Moby as a posterboy for electronic music, Buddhistvegan mysticism, and stiffback political correctness none of which is evident on Hotel. For starters, Moby used to make electronic music, am I right? I distinctly remember the first time I came across his literary moniker; it was affixed to a single of his ravehouse burner \"Go\", which still lingers in my hippocampus. Nowadays, other than the couple of vanilla slices of new age, er, I mean, \"ambient\" that bookend Hotel (as well as, yikes, an entire bonus disc), Moby's songs are less techno than the song in which Eminem gave his famous antitechno bitchslap. Sure, some drum loops and keyboard diddles are still in the background, but nothing that couldn't turn up on an aging midlife crisis album by, say, John Mellencamp. Mellencamp isn't a bad point of reference, come to think of it. Hotel strikes the same mood of onewaystreet sloganeering, although it's aimed at a sort of coastal bluestate weekend mysticism rather than a Midwest red, farm, etc. And strangely, the author of Buddhism for Dummies anthem \"We Are All Made of Stars\" now apparently thinks we are all on about a firstgrade level of comprehension. Songs tip off impending choruses like a bad poker player leaning back in his chair when he's got a big hand. Imagery is simple, familiar, and recycled rain is used twice, first on \"Raining Again\" and reprised on \"Love Should\". And Moby spends a lot of time repeating trite phrases, such as \"look at us, we're beautiful.\" (Twentytwo times in, duh, \"Beautiful\" counting is less painful than listening.) Most disturbing is a twosong block roughly halfway through Hotel where Moby abruptly decides to stop Up With Peopling and, gulp, gets his sex on with the help of chanteuseonpayroll, Laura Dawn. Over a beat that sounds like what scifi movies pass off as futuristic pop (think the Diva scene in The Fifth Element), \"Very\" drops pillow talk like eightyearolds imagining how babies are made: \"Now we are naked/ Just youoohoo/ You and meeeee.\" And slow jam wannabe \"I Like It\" comes complete with softcore moaning, wet keyboards, and spokenword talksinging of the title (43 times, to be exact) all it needs is Bob Odenkirk occasionally adding \"Yeahhhhh.\" Dawn is also a collaborator on the album's most egregious sin, the track that drops Hotel from being mediocre dreck, easily quarantined and ignored, to something far worse. I'm talking, of course, about Melville's cover of New Order's \"Temptation\", which takes the lovestruck dancefloor daze of the original and strips it down to nauseating Rhodes, preset, and canned strings slowcore. Suddenly, I find myself longing for the halcyon days of Frente!. If Moby has accomplished anything with Hotel, it's that he may have become the rare musical artist equally despised by both of modern music criticism's warring camps. Rockists will retch at the blatant AAA radiowhoring of \"Raining Again\" and \"Spiders\", while popists will abhor Moby's indieesque selfsatisfaction though thankfully there's nothing here as condescending as Play's \"South Side\". But being the man in the middle isn't working for Moby; overdosing on moderatism, the guy who supposedly gave electronica a face is ironically now a blank manufacturer of rockbynumbers. Whether seduced by chart flirtations or weary of constant mockery, Moby has filed away his distinguishing characteristics, and all that's left is an artist too played out to even be one of Eminem's punchlines.
