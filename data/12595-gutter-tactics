Forget that most of the speeches the media and political opponents of Barack Obama got hysterical over were made years ago, in 2008 Wright was your bogeyman, and news coverage ensured his \"God damn America!\" refrain will echo down through the ages. Wright caused millions of knees to jerk with those words when they were dug up and aired, but I've thought all along that he got a bum deal in a media that wants to smack you with a sensation and would prefer it if you didn't bother to think deeply. That's not to say that I think America should go straight to hell of course, but I at least think his comments come from somewhere intellectually and emotionally honest, and taken in their context whether you believe Wright is a raging, aging relic, a traitor, or a righteous prophet are a powerful exercise of the First Amendment.The duo behind Dälek apparently agrees, as Dälek (the MC the band is named for) steps back and gives the opening verse on Gutter Tactics to the Reverend, playing a long excerpt of a sermon in which he enumerates a series of American atrocities against Native Americans, blacks, and others, riding a slow crescendo in which he reminds his parishioners that many of the people who die under our bombs are just ordinary folks trying to live their lives and put food on the table. Listening, I think it's not so much the content of his message that makes us shift in our seats so much as the bluntness and lack of a leavening agent, the part where he says, \"Well, America has its faults, but when you get right down to it it's a pretty great place.\" He never provides the counterargument, and in that respect, he could probably join Dälek fulltime, because verbal bluntness and sonic brutality are basically their stock in trade.To Dälek and the band's producer half, Oktopus, dystopia isn't some abstract future; it's what we're living in right now, and though I'm sure that on at least some level they were happy to see a member of a minority elected President, they aren't letting on here. They say as much on \"No Question\", Dälek rapping, \"A black president don't ensure the sunshine/ A rich president represent his own kind/ As it stands now, the blind lead the blind.\" Even if you don't share their cynicism, the conviction of the delivery sells it anyway Dälek are as methodically effective as ever, their signature blend of simple beats, carefully sculpted noise, and straightforward flow still highly unique after more than a decade. The vocals and lyrics, as always, play a much more secondary role than in basically any other rap group, with the little bits that stand out coherently above the mix providing about all the parts of the picture you need to construct the whole.\"Los Macheteros/Spear of a Nation\", for instance, calmly chronicles the injustices delivered upon Nelson Mandela by the Apartheid government of South Africa amid a hellstorm of processed drums and cascading sheets of feedback, with bits of muffled dialogue and South African choral music crying out from the depths. On the other side of things, \"A Collection of Miserable Thoughts Laced With Wit\" is actually quite pretty, dappling an echoing beat with smears of backward keyboard and piano. The vocal is buried and processed, used more as a rhythmic tool than a lead or focal point. While the intensity of their earlier records is still mostly intact, Dälek have hit on a more spacious, open method for arranging their sounds, so that even a pounding dirge like \"Who Medgar Evers Was...\" feels more inviting than assaultive. There's no \"Black Smoke Rises\" endurance test here.Of course, it wouldn't be a Dälek record without at least one track decrying the state of hiphop, and \"We Lost Sight\" provides that. Still, I've never bought the idea that Dälek was rap for people who hate rap. Some people who aren't normally crazy for hiphop will undoubtedly enjoy this album, but I think it's primarily for people who believe that hiphop is a broad canvas that demands people who color in the fringes, and Dälek do that, musically and politically. The opening Wright sample is a hard look back at a year most people would already rather forget, but it's a perfect intro for Gutter Tactics, an album that draws much of its strength from the same well of outrage and disaffection.
