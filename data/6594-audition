With a personality that lies somewhere between backoftheclass snark machine and overeducated carnival barker, P.O.S. is the unmitigated star of this crew. He's slick with his verbs and an electric, engaging performer, but he lacks a certain perceptibility.Audition is P.O.S.'s second album and his goals seem dignified: Cull punk's fiery abrasions and mesh it with the continually refined, authentically emotive hiphop that's been billowing out of Minnesota for some time. This goal is all but impossible. His version of punk's manic, enraged tension essentially its spine is antithetical to the downy grooves that propelled Slug to pinup status. If recent Rhymesayers history has taught us anything, the more aggressive the Atmosphere song, the more grating. That's clear on the jazzy \"BushLeague PsychOut Stuff\", which features Slug intoning his quasifamous \"Gimme a pound or a hug\" mantra in opposition to P.O.S.'s angry young man steez. He's right to mess with guitar fractals and unsteady bass, there's not enough sophisticated intermingling going on in the underground right now. But against a cool, effortless Slug, P.O.S. sounds like a guy tugging on shirt tails. \"Half Cocked Concepts\" opens Audition with the sort of propulsive, shouted chorus and sawtoothed guitars that terrify most dyedintheAir Forces rap fans. It's a trick. Most of the joints after that are more accessible, but his challenge to the audience is obvious: \"Brace your bowels, this won't be easy, I'm not an easy artist and I don't rap about blunts, broads, bitches, bras, menageatrois, or sex in expensive cars.\" \"Stand Up\" recalls the best, loudest part's of Rjd2's \"The Horror\" and gets closest to his agitprop propers when he sneers, \"We keep our hands warm with the damn Patriot Act.\" Greg Attonito, lead singer of poppunk progenitors Bouncing Souls, joins P.O.S. for a soaring chorus on the autobiographical \"De La Souls\". The album's most distinctly hiphop track, it's built on solemn cello and crackling snares, and offers relationship drama (\"I can safely say I've never played a woman without Karma catching up\") and family death and metaphorical tangle (\"By the time I catch an apple, usually it's rind\"). \"Paul Kersey to Jack Kimball\" sees P.O.S. emulating Eminem's gruff, distressed growl, coupled with spare, empty bathroom horror. \"P.O.S. Is Ruining My Life\" is the album's centerpiece but it grossly reverts to Staindstyle indulgence, practically demanding raised cell phones and LOVEHATE tattoos on your fists. And much has been made of Hold Steady lead singer Craig Finn's \"Predator\"dissing appearance on \"Safety in Speed (Heavy Metal)\". The track, downbeat and ethereal, isn't anything special and the political imagery is murky at best. Finn's attempts at adroit observation are courageous but imprecise. Here, like elsewhere, P.O.S. makes reckoning a certainty. Problem is we're just not sure what he'll leave in his wake: canny significance or imprudent blather. "}
