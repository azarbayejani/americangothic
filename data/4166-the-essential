Byrom","artist":"Iron Maiden","title":"The Essential","text":" Iron Maiden's importance in the history of rock music can hardly be overstated. The band formed at a time when heavy rock music was becoming old and pass√©, yet despite little radio play and a refusal to bow to music business demands, they managed to sell out stadiums the world over. Bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris had a clear vision of what he wanted his band to be from the beginning: His dedication to complex songwriting, rousing, hookladen choruses, and a powerful stage show put the band head and shoulders above their New Wave of British Heavy Metal counterparts. In fact, now, almost 30 years later, the only other band from that scene who remains relatively wellknown is Def Leppard, and they sound radically different today than when they started. Perusing the Maiden discography reveals as many live and \"greatest hits\" packages as studio records. In 1996, the band released what was expected to be the definitive Maiden hits package: Best of the Beast. Since then, however, we've seen The Best of Iron Maiden, Ed Hunter, Eddie's Head, Edward the Great, and now, finally, The Essential. And this isn't even counting the live albums. So why, then, do we need another greatest hits package? I'll leave that one to the accountants. It's a discussion that belongs in the same realm as longtime fans arguing over how they could have possibly left off \"Children of the Damned\", \"Where Eagles Dare\", or \"Can I Play with Madness\". But this isn't a forfans package; instead, The Essential is an twodisc primer on a band that has released 13 studio albums, recorded upwards of 150 songs, and spent the last 25 years defining a genre.  The tracks here are arranged in reversechronological order, a curious choice, but ultimately a good one, forcing attention on newer tracks that may otherwise have been lost. The disc opens with \"Paschendale\" from 2003's underrated Dance of Death. An epic, classicstyle Maiden track, clocking in at over eight minutes, \"Paschendale\" shows anyone who isn't familiar with the band's newer catalogue that little has changed over the years. Singer Bruce Dickinson's pipes are as crisp as ever, and the Steve Harris/Nicko McBrain rhythm section is still bombastic and powerful. From Brave New World, the disc that marked Dickinson's triumphant return to the band, we get \"The Wicker Man\" and the title track. Comeback single \"The Wicker Man\" dispelled worries that the band couldn't recapture the ferocity of its earlier work. \"Brave New World\" starts with mellow, echoed guitar and synth strings, while Dickinson croons over top, but goes on to feature outofnowhere time changes, winding solos, and dual and threeguitar harmonies. From the mid90s we get two tracks apiece from Virtual XI and The X Factor. Both albums featured vocalist Blaze Bayley an accomplished if not exactly original vocalist temporarily replaced Dickinson. The band could've easily found a clone and carried on, and it's to their credit that they avoided that trap, but it's hard to get over the missing Dickinson. Bayley's vocals are somewhere between Dickinson's and original micman Paul Di'anno. He's gruff, but he's got range, able to hold a note with the best of them. Unfortunately the songs just never seem capture the spirit of the band. Fear of the Dark (1990) and No Prayer for the Dying (1992) had some strong moments but far too much filler, and both suffered from goingthroughthemotions syndrome. The four tracks featured here from those discs are just about all the casual fan needs. All four are strong, especially \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", one of the angriest songs in the band's history. And even though \"Bring Your Daughter...to the Slaughter\" has long been lampooned for its silliness, it's worth revisiting as a reminder that these guys aren't nearly as serious as their moody music would indicate.  From 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, we get \"The Clairvoyant\" and \"The Evil that Men Do.\" This was Maiden at both their biggest and their most commercially accessible. The concept album featured tons of hooks and prominently featured synthesizers, and these two tracks showcase those traits magnificently, with \"The Clairvoyant\" containing this set's most triumphant melody.  Continuing backwards through their career, we arrive at Somewhere in Time, Maiden's first album to feature keyboards. \"Wasted Years\", where Dickinson worries that the his golden years are slipping by while he's trapped in a tour bus, begins with one of the most recognizable guitar leads in heavy metal. \"Heaven Can Wait\" is just as anthemic, forgoing the band's often gloomy imagery for an upbeat, positive message. The band's first three albums to feature Bruce Dickinson were released in quick succession: Barely a year separated Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind. The band spent a large chunk of 1983 and 1984 on the road, then fired back with Powerslave. All three are powerhouses, and they are laced with many of the band's most wellknown songs. By Powerslave, the lineup had finally solidified, and, and the benefits of this tightness were apparent. \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", \"Aces High\", \"Flight of Icarus\", \"The Trooper\", \"Number of the Beast\", and \"Run to the Hills\" are live staples to this day. This is Maiden at its strongest, its most confident, and its most adventurous.  From the band's earliest period we get \"Wrathchild\" and \"Killers\" from Killers and \"Phantom of the Opera\" from their selftitled debut. Paul Di'anno's raspy voice is a pretty stark contrast to Dickinson's, but these songs, and the albums they come from, show a younger band still trying to find its sound. \"Wrathchild\" and \"Killers\" both feature an infusion of punk attitude, and \"Phantom of the Opera\" is a an amateur attempt at progrock, featuring tons of time changes, odd vocal harmonies, and an instrumental breakdown in full of tinkling guitar and highend bass.  The collection closes with two live tracks: \"Running Free\" from 1985's Live After Death and \"Iron Maiden\" from the forthcoming Death on the Road. The two tracks do well to bridge the old Iron Maiden with the new. The two songs were originally recorded over 25 years ago, and hearing these versions, themselves 20 years apart, back to back gives strong evidence that these guys are just as powerful today as when they first crawled their way out of East London almost three decades ago.
