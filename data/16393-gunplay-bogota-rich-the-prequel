Even in the crowded lane of fightmusic rap, Gunplay is a breed apart: For sheer fiendish creativity, technical ability, and display of unsettling enthusiasm, he is Bacardi 151 to Waka and French's Everclear: just as potent, but surprisingly refined for something specifically designed to knock you on your ass. His last mixtape, Inglorious Bastard, came out on January 1 of last year, and its loony swagger towered over almost all the streetrap that came out after it. He's nominally a member of Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group, but Ross seems to keep him apart from the crew for some reason, perhaps out of fear of what he might do to a gentle soul like Stalley. He has kept mostly to himself during the MMG empire's expansion he only had a single guest verse on last year's Self Made, Vol. 1 showcase but he seems to have used the time honing his act and upping every conceivable ante on it. Listening to him let loose on Bogota Rich: The Prequel, his new DJ Holiday mixtape, I am reminded of Travis Bickle, doing countless pushups alone, staring into a mirror. Bogota Rich is only 13 songs, an eyeblink as far as rap mixtapes go. If it's all we're getting from Gunplay this year, it's a major letdown. It's billed as the \"appetizer\" to the \"filet mignon\" that will be the full Bogota mixtape, due out at some troublingly unspecific moment in the future. Even with all these minor disappointments, however, it's easily one of the most exciting gangstarap releases of the year so far. As a rapper, Gunplay has become darker and more interesting: He's not exactly taking us into into \"Diary of a Madman\" territory yet, but he comes off as genuinely dangerous and unpredictable, whereas on Inglorious he sometimes sounded like Foghorn Leghorn with a bad coke habit. A lot of that edge comes from his delivery. His word choices, which have always been surprising, are now a headturning parade of \"wait, what?\" His phrasing is full of rhythmic trap doors and unseen left hooks. \"Bank filled to the brim/ Spilled on my rims/ One sheet to the wind/ Cup of gin to the chin/ Jewels on my limbs/ do not attempt,\" is the Tommygun volley Gunplay opens the tape with. Later from the same song, he tells us, \"Never flew what I flaunt/ All you seen is the wing.\" On \"Fuck Shit\", he's \"just another petty thief, never had a spaghetti feast.\" On the riotous \"Jump Out\", he doesn't just stick people up, he gets \"wretched with my ratchet until I see my proper ends.\" There is no threat or depraved boast that he can't embellish or improve with some odd, singular wording. Far too many verses on this brief mixtape are given over to the other two members of Triple Cs, the group that Gunplay is also, at least theoretically, a member of. Of the three, Torch is the secondmost interesting, but the gap between them is cavernous. The second he starts rapping, you begin waiting for Gunplay to return. Also: The Nazi Thing continues to be unsavory. Inglorious Bastard featured him in full regalia, and on several points on Bogota Rich he sniggeringly refers to himself as Don \"Adolf\" Logan. But it seems to be no more than a \"thing,\" with as much commitment to it as a swastika idly dug into a middleschool desk with a compass edge in the hopes that it will piss someone anyone off. \"Everything I say so goddamn low life,\" goes the sneering chorus to \"Low Life\", and it's a line Gunplay leans into pretty hard: The title of the song is repeated 40 times in four minutes. It's his Message, and if he continues to find as many creative ways to dig into it on the expanded Bogota as he does here, it will almost certainly be one of the most entertaining rap releases of the year.
