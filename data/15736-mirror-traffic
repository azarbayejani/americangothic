{"label":" Matador / Domino","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16863/homepage_large.288e66e0.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Rob Mitchum","artist":"Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks","title":"Mirror Traffic","text":" As we spend the next nine years critically dissecting and reassessing the 1990s, let's agree to make one historical revision: The lofi auteurs of the era your Malkmuses, your Pollards, your Elephant Sixers were not in fact \"slackers,\" despite the prevailing label/insult of the the day. Truthfully, their lack of studio polish was not a matter of laziness, ironic aesthetic, or poverty, but a coping mechanism for the unstoppable torrent of melodies, words, and ideas exploding from each songwriter's brain. No time for getting that song exactly right on to the next one. That firstdraft immediacy can fade with success, creative fatigue, or that demon \"maturity.\" In the case of Malkmus, the transformation took the flavor of just wanting to play his damn guitar a midlife crisis where sports cars were replaced with extended solos, ornate riffs, and long songs that felt even longer. But if the recent rash of altrock reunions were meant to cash in on audience nostalgia, perhaps some happy memories ricocheted back onto the bandleaders as they revisited their ragged, spontaneous greatest hits. To put it plainly, Mirror Traffic is not the time travel back to Pavement's peak that is the futile wish of every 30something indie dork, but it is a rewind to a less perfectionist Malkmus, packed with the most mischief and weirdness he's displayed since his eponymous solo debut. It also has the most songs since Wowee Zowee. Like that declaration of independence from the confines of a successful band, Mirror Traffic possesses a relaxed, spontaneous feel befitting his earlier days in NoCal. Despite originally wanting to title the album L.A. Guns and putting the hardrocking \"Senator\" forward as the first single, Malkmus largely lays off the Guitar Hero: The fretboard theatrics are used more sparingly and deployed to much greater effect on \"Forever 28\" where a \"Mr. Blue Sky\" bounce is interrupted by Thin Lizzy runs, or in the thrilling summertime riff of \"Stick Figures in Love\". Only three songs break the fiveminute barrier, and these feel far less claustrophobic than the extended tracks on the last three Jicks records. \"Share the Red\"'s shambolic waltz, for instance, goes down easier than the 10minutelong interlocking duets of \"Real Emotional Trash\". Songs also move in unexpected directions, like the Go! Teamish coda of \"No One Is (As I Are Be)\" or the slingshot tempo changes of \"Spazz\". Even a brief interstitial like \"Jumblegloss\" with cosmic guitars and unidentifiable auditory objects whirring by is a refreshing bit of spontaneity to rinse after the album's most Jickslike rocker, \"Brain Gallop\". The less serious vibe better suits Malkmus' still intact sense of humor and menagerie of oddballs (opening here with a nudist in Birkenstocks and ending 15 songs later with a cousin \"down with soft rap\"). Happily, celebrity producer Beck doesn't employ the heavy hand he showed earlier this year on Thurston Moore's Demolished Thoughts, which reenacted Sea Change with the Sonic Youth frontman on vocals. Here, Beck's fingerprints are lighter he plays enabler to Malkmus' quirks, leaving in midvocal laughs, adding subtle lapsteel on \"Tigers\" and \"Long Hard Book\", and fuzzing out the punkish \"Spazz\" and \"Tune Grief\". Whether he likes it or not, Malkmus is the indierock version of a Dylan or Simon or U2, artists who will forever be blurbed as making \"their best album since ____.\" Competing with his younger self is definitely not a priority for Malkmus, who went through Pavement's reunion tour like he was punching a clock. Any resemblance to earlier days is likely unintentional, but for the aging hipsters of the world, even an accidental flashback is a good contact high. Mirror Traffic tickles that nostalgia without sacrificing maturity, discovering that \"playfully relaxed\" is a valid third route between \"slacker\" and \"manic.\" "}
