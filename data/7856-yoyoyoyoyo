{"label":" Big Dada","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/7733/homepage_large.2b0eccd2.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Sean Fennessey","artist":"Spank Rock","title":"Yoyoyoyoyo","text":" \"It's party music.\" \"No consequences.\" \"Just assshaking shit.\" \"Why you hating?\" \"Stop thinking so hard.\" BULLETIN: Reports are circulating that Miami Bass paragon Luther \"Uncle Luke\" Campbell's filthy and amazing split box set, My Life and Freaky Times, featuring a soundtrack and a 2xCD spoken word audiobiography, has been delayed by retailers citing its content and lascivious packaging inappropriate. In other news, Spank Rock released Yoyoyoyoyo last month. That's the hierarchy. Yoyoyoyoyo is one of the most precise and brilliantly produced albums of the year. Onetime DFA disciple Armani XXXChange, working from a homemade studio in an apartment in Brooklyn, displays a keen ear for smart ways to mash regional and timelost delicacies (HTown Screw, BMore Club, Philly Soul, Miami bass, NYC Electro, 1980s dance pop, Samba, First Wave Freestyle, etc.). XXXChange uses dugout bass, Space Invaders blips, and relentless 808s, among myriad sound effects, to enhance what can feel like sonic revolution. Each song uses a new sound to flex his skills, like the cheekpop plucking on \"What It Look Like\" or the spedup orchestral underbelly on \"Coke & Wet\". \"Bump\" has an accelerating cowbell and synth loop as tight and hilarious as anything on LCD Soundsystem's debut. His versatility is a gift, though it sometimes robs Spank Rock of any discernable individuality. Still, an album full of disconnected but adventurous beats is hardly grounds for failure. More troubling is the message.  Much has been made of MC Naeem Juwan's geographical history. Born in Baltimore, a move to Philadelphia reportedly informed his style, as have tutorials from noted Rawkus beatsmith Shawn J. Period. But Juwan's rap POV bears little resemblance to Mos Def or Talib Kweli, nor does it fit bass's garrulous charm or Baltimore Club's chantheavy style. He's got a heliumlaced voice and his patterns are intentionally manic, jumping around, offbeatoron, as if his point can't be made fast enough. Sometimes it's dazzling; mostly, it's frustrating. \"Rick Rubin\" is less about the producer, and more a questioning philosophical treatise (\"Is it offkey?/ Is it just too hip?/ Is it out of touch or is it the touch?\") Spank Rock doing his Rimbaud joint over stutterclap, revealing one of many knowing winks on the album. He also raps about ass. A lot.  Moving bodies is as worthy a goal now as it was when Little Richard sang, \"Good booty, if it don't fit, don't force it\". But Spank Rock's unspoken nihilism or, more pointedly, chauvinism has been getting a pass. You may be thinking, \"Rap writer comes down on innocuous, possibly ironic goodtime MC for sexism, continues ignoring Interscope artist's crimes.\" Fair point. Amanda Blank hops on \"Bump\" for a verse that could outnasty Lil' Kim on her worst day to balance things, if only for a song. It's just that when a group like Spank Rock achieves a certain status with tastemakers, so much of its ethos remains uncontested and unclear. The quotes above are some of the responses I've heard when attempting to engage in conversation about this album. I still can't tell how serious Juwan is when he says, \"Assshaking competition champ, ooh that pussy gets damp, pump that pump that pump that amp.\" The image is clear. But is it sheer reportage? Fantasy? He's got jokes? No doubt he likes ass. Next to a domineering pro like Uncle Luke, though, Juwan comes off like a stepchild.  There's a fluid, unidentifiable hipster appeal to Spank Rock and Yoyoyoyoyo. Because they lack a true identity, they're as comfortable performing with Bun B or Devin the Dude as Man Man or Animal Collective. Existing in the Hollertronix quadrant a fun, strange cultural sphere occupied by the undeniably talented but suspiciously prominent Diplo, among others will get you criticized as vacant. There's nothing vacant about the dire sexuality chirped about here, it'd just be more useful if it could be more easily understood. The thrilling and immediate \"Coke & Wet\" is so raw, smacked by a sharp Moog and guitarslink, that when Juwan oddly boasts through the chorus \"Coke and wet, bitch/Guns, nigga, holla!\" it sounds like it could be parody. On the other hand, closer \"Screwville, USA\" is as nostalgic and dramatic a Houston anthem as I've heard this year. And who knows if these dudes have even been to Texas.  "}
