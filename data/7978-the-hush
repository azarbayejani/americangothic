Carbonated drumbeats provide a smooth, soft, cocoabuttery surface like a well tanned midriff. It spreads out between a tight cotton tee and a pair of skinsqueezing jeans with the top few buttons haphazardly loose, allowing singer/pinup Sharleen Spiteri's voice to dance across it like the brushing of delicately painted fingernails around the navel and upper pubis. A deep, discotheque bassline fills the sound nicely like two handfuls of pillowy, gradeA breast inflating the top of a red tanktop. A sixfigure studio budget paints a shimmer over the sound like an iced tea colored tan, grains of fine, white sand, and tongue tip sized beads of sweat. Spiteri's seductive falsetto slips effortlessly between postcoital, bangs in face tease and professional puckered, glossy, slightlyseparated lips like a Revlon commercial tailored blend of Natalie Imbruglia, Prince, Donna Summer, Everything But the Girl, and a sultry Suede. \"Summer Son\" bounces along like twotoned buttocks frollicking under a silk skirt, while the title track slowjams erotically like Spiteri rubbing down her body with her eyes closed, lips blooming to reveal marble teeth and a sentient tongue. Well, no. Really, there's more to this \"music\" than the singer's looks. Really. Stop looking at that. She's out of our league. Give me that back. I want the artwork! "}
