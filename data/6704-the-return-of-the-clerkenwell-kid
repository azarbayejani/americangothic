(The really real Tuesday Weld is an Elvisdating, Dudley Mooredivorcing pinup turned Oscar nominee, but anyway that's not her real name.) After loosely basing 2004's excellent I, Lucifer on a Glen Duncan novel, Coates ballasts his latest Prohibitionera cocktail cruise with another loveboatload of conceits vague storyline, vaguer alter ego, and the everloved love/death dichotomy but The Return of the Clerkenwell Kid is ultimately an exercise in déjà vu: the feeling you've been to this electrolounge before.Return revisits a baker's dozen of tracks from the Weld's 2001 debut, Where Psyche Meets Cupid, albeit with fresh recordings and a smattering of, ahem, real new material. Also recurring is Coates' selfdescribed \"antique beat\" style, which in itself mingles the longago with the recent: Twenties and '30s musichall and Tin Pan Alley (via \"When I'm SixtyFour\", Village Greenpreserving Kinks, or tourmate/fan Stephin Merritt of Magnetic Fields) with copious sampling and light, pastoral electronics of the Saint Etienne school. Scratchy victrolalike sound effects and sly clarinetplaying enliven resurrected tracks like banjopicker \"Am I in Love?\" as well as the newbies, including instrumental opener \"Waking Up\" and melodramatic ballad \"Little White Birds\". Punpicking \"Daisies\" adds a bossa nova rhythm. More than just another case of history repeating, Return really makes you think twice. With whirring electronic beats and everslinkier clarinet, \"L'amour et La Morte\" strips Coates' loveanddeath theme what the French call assnaked. \"Got a heart like an exit wound,\" Coates breathily halfsings behind his usual telephonelike filter (a more confident presentation would better suit the ambitious arrangements). The songs trace an apparently romantic relationship from the sprightly, unsuspecting acoustic guitar of \"Anything But Love\" to the wry \"Goodbye Stephen\", in which Coates envisions his own demise (\"Will my family and friends all turn out to wave/ Dressed in their best fine nice things to say?\"). Between, \"I Love the Rain\" offers porn wahwah, distant piano lines, didgeridoolike noises and the admonition to \"let's get wet\". Newbie \"Something Beautiful\" goes alpha beta gaga with multipart vocal harmonies. Unfortunately, Return misfires more often than its predecessors, omitting the debut's great \"Terminally Ambivalent Over You\" and never living up to I, Lucifer's inspired scatdance single \"Bathtime in Clerkenwell\". Overly precious \"Lavender Hill\", in particular, suffers by comparison (uh, is that acoustic guitar intro from \"Free Falling\"?). When his conceits pay off, though, Coates appends a few charming, eclectic revisions to music history and his own. On a song called \"Déjà Vu\", his whisper takes on Waitsian darkness: \"This touch on your skin reminds you of/ What was it again?\" The feeling you've been to this electrolounge before... "}
