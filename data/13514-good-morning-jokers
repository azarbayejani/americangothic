Most \"modern\" folk artists basically look like members of Tapes n' Tapes with better flannel. I suppose Devendra Banhart had his moment, but he was hardly one of the pretty people. Consider, though, Mi (Mira Romantschuk) and L'au (Laurent Lecl√®re): a former Finnish fashion model (Mi) and a Frenchman who probably could've been (L'au) meet in Paris. They look gaunt, smoke cigarettes, and wear clothes that would probably look stupid on most of us. Two of their songs (\"Philosopher\", \"Dance on My Skin\") have been used by Chanel in promotional materials. Not what's expected of a duo that records in cabins in Finland and hangs with Michael Gira, but Good Morning Jokers, their sophomore album for Borne Recordings, finds plenty of ways to subvert modern folk trends.The fashion links above may be a bit tangential, but Good Morning Jokers invokes plenty of artists who are visually inclined: Scott Walker, Nico, Serge Gainsbourg. While never falling in with the mumbly, illbordered folk music that usually comes out of Finland (see the Fonal label, et al.), Good Morning Jokers also emboldens the sounds the group explored on their eponymous 2005 debut. The songs here are almost universally more adventurous, with Mi and L'au exploring brassy funeral marches (\"Bingo\"), sourpuss orchestral movements (\"They're Coming\"), and sanguine (literally) Faheylite fingerpicking (\"Vampire\").L'au in particular makes strides on Good Morning Jokers. No longer content to mumble alongside Mi, he shows off a reserved, expressive baritone. When he sings, slowly, on \"Vampire\", \"You're like my Lord/ Making me fly before taking my blood\" his voice contains hints of an accent that lends his delivery an internal energy.Mi handles most of the creeping, floorboardsqueaking balladry. Neither as deliberate as Nico nor as unhinged as Cat Power, Mi's timbre seems to fall somewhere between the two. She ekes out some lines that, even on an album this artserious, can feel lost and heavy. \"I will shine in the shadows of a snake/ Crawling through the windows of the pain,\" she sings during the chorus of \"Ten Kingdoms\", and not with enough velocity or character to allow you to ignore its overbearing nothingness.That's a bit harsh, though, as throughout most of Good Morning Jokers she is tenderly contemplative and transfixed, like on \"Dance on My Skin\", possibly the year's slowest, quietest sex jam and the only one to talk about the moons of Jupiter (we need a Goldfrapp cover of this, pronto). On \"Bingo\" she is coy and dangerous before the horns steal her tune. Opening duet \"Up in the Building\" contains what might be this pair's most ascendant and plainsong melody.The remainder of Good Morning Jokers contains slight variations on the duo's frosty, slowly developing folk music, but much of it (\"The Pearl\", \"Clown\") is clear and loving. From its hideous cover art on down, the album is in some ways less charming than their selftitled; bolder melodic and compositional choices can erode familiarity and polarize listeners. But Good Morning Jokers feels like a more realized, heady take on the formula, seeping, however abstractly, with the style and fashion of its creators. "}
