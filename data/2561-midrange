Weeping for the lofi indie rawk of ages past? For the days of dorky inbetween song giggling, onestringed guitars and cardboardbox drum sets? Of course, people still bang on cardboard boxes, notebooks, pots and pans, but in all likelihood, they drop that track into Fruity Loops, sequence it into a glitchhop backbeat, layer 20 tracks of synths on top and get a record deal without ever leaving their bedroom. Just like Mike Dykehouse, who released a collection of his homemade digital diddling on \\xB5Ziq's Planet Mu a few years back.Dynamic Obsolescence (2001) was, as Dykehouse himself is quick to point out, recorded \"years before it was released\" (hence the title), but even if he did record it in the mid90s, his Paradinasworship was totally unremarkable then, and by its release in 2001, superfluous. Dykehouse had the resources to explore whatever rep \\xB5Ziq's name lent, and moved to New York City, where his embarrassing selfdoubt peaked with a ridiculous nonperformance at CMJ, during which he walked around the room as his music played, pouting. A burnedout Dykehouse moved back to his old stomping grounds, Ann Arbor, for some much needed clarity, and finally realized IDM was fucking over sometime in 2001. He decided to take a stab at more traditional pop, with the aim of creating something \"somewhere between Steely Dan and noisy electronic things,\" but at some point during his work, someone mentioned that his stuff sounded kind of shoegazey. Weeks later, Dykehouse is covering Wire's \"Map Ref.\" as recorded by MBV (probably never knowing who Wire was), and crafting a \"tribute to his hero Kevin Shields.\" Why there isn't a sticker on this CD saying \"for fans of My Bloody Valentine!\" I can't tell you; the promotional onesheet boils down to that sentence repeated a dozen times. It's obvious from some of the ungodly drum machine pap on Midrange that Mike Dykehouse is more personally invested in Loverboy than Loveless. Take the REO Speedwagon laugher \"Make This\", or the widely downloaded \"Chain Smoking\", an edgier version of Pete Yorn's \"Closet\". This is exactly the kind of putrid mainstream dogshit that outs guiltridden indie apologists for their inability to like something that hasn't been confirmed as \"cool\" based on its image or position in the market (or dreamy album art, which incidentally is the most impressive thing about this otherwise soulless album). Why is Mike's version of events more attractive simply because it's not on MTV? Ulrich Schnauss had the sense to remain anonymous in his loopdloop Slowdive tributes, ducking these questions of intent, but Dykehouse's overwrought, multitracked melodrama (not the first of its kind) and ponderous promotional blurbs \"There are no real instruments on my new recordings, sort of the audio equivalent of the painter Michael Bidlo\" make me wonder whether the childlike glee of homerecording is dead. Have ProTools, Cubase, Garage Band and Goldwave turned budding songsmiths into cynical careerists at the first mouseclick? And when did a mouseclick replace the drum stick, or the timeless liberating calltoarms, \"1, 2, 3, 4!\"? I guess when a publicistdriven hair band like The Stills incorporates the act of buying a fourtrack into their bio, lofi is just a fashion statement, so why bother? Look, I'm not going to sit here and tell you DIY rock 'n' roll is dead, but if Mike Dykehouse is \"an auteur,\" it's definitely between a click and a hard place.Midrange is intended as a rock record, but there's not a drop of energy or spark to speak of; Mike Dykehouse's inspirations here are obvious and overused, as he runs through tributes to Echo & The Bunnymen (\"Signal Crossing\"), MBV (\"Drown Inside of Me\" is particularly baldfaced), Curve (\"Burden of Proof\") and Ride (\"Lost Holiday\"). I can't say whether these artists are simply news to Mike Dykehouse, inspiring him to try his hand, or if he's out to take advantage of their recent, nostalgic overexposure, but insofar as he fails to prove himself worthy of association, the point is moot.
