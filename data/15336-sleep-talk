One of that city's most notable garage albums of late, Hunx and his Punx's Too Young to Be in Love, serves as a nice introduction to Shannon Shaw. She provides quite a few of the album's best moments with her brassy, impassioned alto, possessing loads of singing ability and an irresistible charisma. As one of Hunx's \"Punkettes,\" Shaw proved a talented enough roleplayer to convince you she deserved her own band. Luckily, she's actually had one for a while now. On Shannon and the Clams' debut, 2009's I Wanna Go Home, Shaw and cosongwriter and guitarist Cody Blanchard added a rockabilly punch to the looseygoosey garagepunk of the Growlers and early Black Lips records. Though the album was an allaround solid exhibit of Shaw's charms as a frontwoman and her chemistry with Blanchard, Sleep Talk is a refinement, a streamlining, an improvement in every way. That spike in quality begins with the band's heightened versatility. While I Wanna Go Home split the difference between rumbling, rousing rock tunes and sultry slow jams, Sleep Talk is impressively diverse. Shaw wails and shouts her way through the dark protopunk of \"Toxic Revenge\", conjuring the leather jackets of Max's Kansas City, punctuated with a cacophony of saxophones. Album highlight \"Tired of Being Bad\" combines Shaw's captivating, emotive vocals with Apollo Theater soul, an unexpected but welcome match. In addition to Shaw's ability as a singer and her infectious vocal tics she whoops and yelps all over \"Old Man Winter\", and her raspy growl on \"Done With You\" could strip the bark off of trees Sleep Talk benefits from some unique songwriting. \"The Woodsman\" serves as a striking R&B murder ballad, while the production on the record which could accurately be described as \"dusky\" will likely be mistaken as \"lofi\" when it's simply vintage, a common misconception for modern music recorded without the assistance of computers. Elsewhere on Sleep Talk, Blanchard exists as Shaw's equal counterpart. His guitar licks sound untrained but impressive, understated and effective but eager to cede the spotlight to the band's frontwoman. As a backing vocalist, Blanchard is arguably even better, adding a classic R&B vibe to both \"Tired of Being Bad\" and the album's title track while bolstering \"Oh Louie\" with a cascading 1950s rock'n'roll baritone. \"Half Rat\" tests the band's use of dynamics by switching from diaphanous to roughhewn and back, providing a stirring crescendo and fierce climax for the album replete with drum rolls, a galloping chorus, and everything coming apart at the seams by the song's finish. It's a kind of overview of Sleep Talk's strengths, showing how productively Shannon and the Clams can combine grit and prettiness, how effortlessly they mix the salt with the sugar. "}
