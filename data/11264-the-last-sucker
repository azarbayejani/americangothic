Bush. And Dick Cheney. Hell, republicans in general. The Last Sucker, Ministry's 11th and \"last\" studio album, as well as the final piece in his antiBush trilogy that also includes 2004's Houses of the Mol√© and 2006's Rio Grande Blood, makes that pretty clear. Again. The subject matter of the 11 tracks should be familiar territory for Ministry fans or anyone who's attended a collegiate antiwar rally typical, tame antiBush shit, but Jourgensen sounds so angry, it hardly matters what he's ranting about. Like, you don't need to give a shit about Satan to get into Marduk or Gorgoroth it's the bleak, intense atmosphere that's conjured.The Last Sucker does have powerful sonic moments. The amped Texas twostep of \"Let's Go\"'s like an updated \"Jesus Built My Hotrod\", despite an incredibly goofy vocal sample. The guitar parts on it are intense. The fuzzed bass and nu metal chops of \"Watch Yourself\" divorced from the \"Big Brother\" theme has some chunky riffs and headwagging grooves. And it is pretty rousing when Jourgensen shouts, \"There's no running away/ This is the U.S.A.\" Likely because it sounds like it could be a chant that means a thousand different things. The nonspecificity works. One of the best tracks, \"Die in a Crash\", maintains whiplash intensity throughout, upping it a tad for an \"I can feel it/ I can feel the pressures of this life\" chorus that, as I write this, should be going over well in gymnasiums everywhere. Jourgensen also turns in a fun cover of \"Roadhouse Blues\", which is prefaced by an \"All I wanna do is get my kicks before this whole shithouse goes up in flames.\" And get his \"kicks\" he does.  The percussive \"Death & Destruction\" pieces together Bush's creepy laugh (sounding very devilish) and a bunch of samples from the big guy that fit with and echo the title. Then Jourgensen puts his back into it. \"The Last Sucker\" is another catchy tune that traces Bush \"I never studied but I got my degree/ I didn't need to with my family tree\" in all the usual ways. The best example of the weak content destroying an otherwise enjoyable track is \"The Dick Song\" explosive musically, but the dorky samples and \"run run run Cheney's got a gun\" chorusing feel like a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch. On the other hand, samples are put to good use on \"No Glory\", which discusses the pointlessness of the war in Iraq, punctuating the buzzing instrumentation with acapella spoken \"greed,\" \"power,\" and \"corruption.\" It creates a dynamic, instead of stealing the band's thunder.  In the end, though, The Last Sucker goes out in a blaze of glory, largely because the last three songs are also the album's best. First is the aforementioned ritalinchomping \"Die in a Crash\" and then \"End of Days\", Parts I and II. Fear Factory's Burton Christopher Bell adds vocals to all three. The two \"End of Days\" tracks are a combined 14 minutes long. The first part is more of the numetal, Bell howling and barking angrily: \"Judgment day's upon us and I see no one cares,\" etc. Kinda sounds like Fear Factory. The second is a long, somber, meditation on the end of things. The vocal part is kinda Vincent Pricein\"Thriller\" and there's a fucking kid's choir! Threaded into the end of the piece, too, is Eisenhower's wellknown farewell speech. Pretend it's Jourgensen speaking, because it is: End of Bush, end of the world, end of Ministry. It's his State of the Union. The last words conjured by Ministry before Eisenhower checks the mic are \"Face down on pavement and drunk at the end of my days/ The end of days.\" Defusing the pomp, it's a suitable ending to an overblown exeunt.  Otherwise, The Last Sucker isn't as huge as Psalm 69, but it is Ministry's most exciting record since. Just don't go into it thinking you'll get any astute politicizing  but then, that's not what we go to Ministry for, right? And, as tearjerky as the finale is, this isn't the end for Uncle Al! A covers collection called Cover Up with takes on the Stones, Beatles, and others should be out soon. And he's basically halting Ministry so he can spend time building the stable at his label, 13th Planet, a subsidiary of Megaforce. Plus, the final tour the he \"CULaTour\" includes Meshuggah as a supporting act. So, even if you're showing up to theater to see the Swedish techmetal gods bring their brilliant, apocalyptic obZen to life, Ministry should have some new jams to keep you interested. Though I imagine the betweensong bantor could get pretty painful.  "}
