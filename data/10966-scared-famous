Scared Famous culls 17 tracks from Scared Famous/ FF>>, a 2002 doublecassette that falls somewhere between The Doldrums and House Arrest in Pink's dodgy Haunted Graffiti series. Like every Pink release before it, Scared Famous is notequalenough parts random brilliance and sonic bullshit. Much is made of Pink's AM radio fetish, but no one simply picks up a copy of Armed Forces or Radio City and automatically assembles 4track tapes whose songs feature grating noise breakdowns. Indeed, Pink is an avantgarde artist, possibly reluctantly, definitely goofily; see the original cover art of FF>>, which features Pink photoshopped over the cover art of Amon Düül's Yeti. But couching Pink's noisiness in groups like Red Krayola and Wire makes good sense; these aesthetic styles jibe with Pink's selfimposed limitations and arcane wankery. Such is the case for Scared Famous' strongest track, \"The List (My Favorite Song)\", a muscular postpunk number that thankfully finds Pink eschewing his famously trying falsetto. The horror synths of \"The Kitchen Club\" and the ringing palpitations of \"In a Tomb All Your Own\" also point to these unsung influences. This sense of exploration informs all of Scared Famous, even as Pink's wellworn pop moves inevitably take over. \"Are You Gonna Look After My Boys?\" is Pink's most overt Johnston sketch, all ringtone synthesizers and tinny refrains. \"Politely Declined\" features traded female/male vocals and college rock axework. Aggressively bad mixing obscures \"Girl in a Tree\", but its circular piano still aims it towards Fleetwood Mac's soupy orchestration. \"Beefbud\", chunkily bizarre, is a psychrock relic. The willfully negligent production and arrangement remains, but viewed as a transition between his very early work and the slight improvements he'd made by House Arrest, they're nearly permissible.  Still, admitting Pink's experimental lineage and even his tapetrading past makes it harder to lend him the benefit of the doubt: Surely anyone with his awareness of music history should want better. This has always been the knock on Pink that he knows enough to craft mystique but not necessarily great albums. As the hypothetical \"best of\" half of a twocassette release, Scared Famous is frightful; \"Howling at the Moon\", \"Talking All the Time\", and the title track are chalky and stale. Not to actually attempt to analyze the content of these tracks, but \"Why Can't I Be Me?\" seems like a misplaced sentiment on the rerelease of an underground cassette of dubious origin and strident pop abstraction. As if someone was preventing him from truly expressing himself. No, Scared Famous is just as scribbled, vain, potent, and halfassed as always.  "}
