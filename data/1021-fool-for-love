{"label":" Bloodshot","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/1014/homepage_large.a319dcff.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Drabick","artist":"Paul Burch","title":"Fool for Love","text":" It seems hard to believe that Bloodshot Records is celebrating their tenth anniversary this year. Between their 45th Jon Langford release and doling out Graham Parker's latest to the minuscule number who still give a shit, Rob and Nan occasionally treat us to something worth listening to, as sometime Lambchop collaborator and WPA Ballclub leader Paul Burch's latest offering proves. Over the course of five records, Burch has continuously reminded listeners that he's carefully studied his Johnny Cash, George Jones, Hank Sr., et al. Fool for Love does not stray at all from his formula, and most of the tracks here would not sound at all out of place if inserted randomly into 2000's Merge release Blue Notes. While there's no song as sublime as that album's \"Isolda\" (still a mix CD winner), this record's push and pull between boomchickaboom twangers and high lonesome balladry is essentially without an outright weak moment. Burch's lyrical prowess could certainly never be confused with the Elvis Costellos of the world, but the focus implied by the record's title is maintained to a strength. The narrator of \"Bad Girl That She Used to Be\" effectively evokes the hapless sucker that falls for some dirty slut only to delude himself that his love has redeemed her from her days of getting tripleteamed by some Theta Chis. (I mean, who hasn't been through something similar? Well, I mean, I haven't, but this friend of mine...) In \"Call My Name\", the shyguy hides his \"face behind a Belgian Chimay\" as an understated pedal steel whines his tale. And while \"Sparks Fly Out\" is a touch obvious, Burch's halting vocal delivery is worthy of the album's only fallingin rather than outoflove song. While the first half of the record has its winners (the opener \"Lovesick Blues Boy\" and the aforementioned \"Bad Girl\" come to mind), \"Fool for Love\" surges in the second half. \"Moments of Weakness\" and especially \"Like Railroad Steel\" use traditional instrumentation to hit Sun Recordsstyle highs. \"Steel\" and closer \"My Last Match\" are heavy on the simile and metaphor, but each are in keeping with the theme. And when the narrator of \"Match\" uses that spark to \"leave this building burning,\" one can only hope that he's used the flames to light a Camel as well. Let's be straight: There are really no surprises here. And if you're the sort of listener that agrees with the 5.9 afforded Blue Notes here at Pitchfork upon its release, there's certainly nothing on Burch's latest that would change your mind. That being said, February, with its endless gray and holiday for lovers, is the perfect month to pop open a Chimay and drink along with the parade of sad and lonely losers that Paul Burch and various members of the Ballclub introduce us to on this eminently enjoyable release.
