In this case, that's a proudly sentimental compliment. Such dancers typically slap together bits of a dozen songs into a fiveminute mix. There are no seamless pauseedits to keep the groove; you can actually hear the tape machine stopping and rerecording between each cut, and yet there is an odd pleasure in grooves that work against dancing. Venezia almost rarely keeps his attention on a beat, sample, or melody for more than a couple of bars it's prime listening for the attentiondeficient, like lysergic cartoon music that evokes the ghosts of Looney Tunes composers Carl Stalling and Raymond Scott. \"Rad Girl Killy\" nails that effect with a zigzagging, rubberband violin, all bludgeoned by crashing \"Amen\" breaks. Nothing ever seems settled on This Means Forever before a sound can dig in its heels, it's slashed apart by a new sonic idea. Bedroom musicians have exploited that premise for years, but Venezia unleashes a genuine trashpunk vibe. He often sings like Fugazi's Guy Picciotto paying his bills as a rollerdisco DJ struggling to coax people onto the dancefloor. The audience response could be the breakbeats that shatter his DJ booth's glass after a thousand hits. \"Wake the dead kids, one at a time!\" Venezia belts out on opener \"Shaken\" over brokenfooted beats, before DSP work gags his vocals with an etherdipped cloth midway through. \"Glassy Eyes\" thumps a groove barely held by twittering synths, while the stronger \"Rocker Party\" focuses on a testosteronepoisoned rhythm. Standouts are the Alec EmpireonNickelodeon funk of \"Never, Nah\", the oxygendepleted dancefloor strut of \"Hushhushdance\", and the dicedup serenades of \"Dubbio\". Most striking is closer \"Tivoli Clinic (10.28.00)\", a fading Polaroid of a ballad with brass drones that simmer into oblivion a prime comedown after all that delirium. "}
