But his initial, late1960s forays into the music industry illustrate that there's a fine line between \"chameleonic\" and \"indecisive\" in his early years, Bowie tried make his name variously as a mod bluesman, a traditional folksinger, an Anthony Newleyschooled theatrical raconteur and, on his 1967 selftitled debut, a musichall dandy. Ironically, it was a song seemingly most susceptible to a brief, noveltytune shelf life that would prove to be his first enduring work: the 1969 single \"Space Oddity\", which, of course, riffed on the similarly titled Stanley Kubrick blockbuster of the day, and was fortuitously timed to court a spacecrazed populace still abuzz from that summer's lunar landing.The ploy didn't quite pay off though the \"Space Oddity\" single cracked the UK Top 5, the sophomore album on which it appeared flopped, as the efforts to establish the David Bowie brand resulted in a confusing release strategy. His UK label, Phillips, issued the album in Britain as David Bowie (making it his second selftitled album), while his U.S. benefactors at Mercury christened it with a title that begged to have it relegated to the folksection cutout bin: Man of Words/Man of Music. But rather than prompt another career aboutface, the album's progfolk hymnals (complete with guest keyboard wizardry from Rick Wakeman of Yes) helped point the way to the artful glamrock that would make Bowie a superstar upon which he would reissue the album in 1972 and rename it after its most famous song.As such, this 40thanniversary reissue of Space Oddity does not so much commemorate a great album it doesn't even rank among Bowie's 10 best but rather the true first chapter in an often brilliant career (not to mention the dawn of Bowie's fruitful collaborative relationship with producer Tony Visconti). Tellingly, the title track has opened pretty much every Bowie greatesthits compilation of note, and rightfully so not only does its stillthrilling rocketlaunch structure anticipate Bowie's own supernova ascent, the song's themes of splendid isolation and uncertain futurism would prove everpresent motifs in his work up through 1980's Scary Monsters. But if the song dramatically reinvents Bowie as a scifi folkie serving as the middleman between late60s hippie idealism and early70s disillusionment with few exceptions, the rest of Space Oddity isn't quite as eager to thrust forth into the great unknown.Instead, we hear a young dude who's still back home with his Beatles and his Stones (see: the perfunctory \"Hey Jude\" groupchorus coda of \"Memory of a Free Festival\" for the former; the extended blues boogie of \"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\" for the latter), with a wellworn copy of Love's Forever Changes close at hand all that's missing from the mellotronic psychfolk serenade \"An Occasional Dream\" is an Arthur Lee cowrite credit. So amid these stately surroundings, sideone closer \"Cygnet Committee\" stands out not just by virtue of its nineminute length, but for its strident disavowal of hippie platitudes (\"[we] stoned the poor on slogans such as 'Wish you could hear!' 'Love is all we need!' 'Kick out the jams!' 'Kick out your mother!'\"); likewise, Bowie's voice overpowers the song's languid folkrock sway as if it were a shackle, introducing his signature technique of intensifying and accelerating his delivery to break free of the verses' preestablished cadences. It's the birth of the classic David Bowie Affectation the one that's been embraced/lampooned by everyone from the Frogs and Ween and Destroyer to Flight of the Conchords making \"Cygnet Committee\" as important a breakthrough for Bowie as Space Oddity's more celebrated title track.Comparatively, Space Oddity's other epic set pieces the overorchestrated fable \"The WildEyed Boy From Freecloud\" and hippiedream requiem \"Memory of a Free Festival\" are too baroque in their presentation to fully transcend the status of timecapsule curios. But they're still historically significant for introducing Bowie's future foil Mick Ronson, who makes an uncredited appearance on the former, while contributing some sixstring muscle to the improved, twopart single version of \"Free Festival\", included on this set's 15track bonus disc.A handful of these rarities have surfaced previously namely on the 1989 Sound+Vision box set, the 1990 CD reissue of Space Oddity and the 2000 Bowie on the Beeb radiosessions compilation and the set feels excessively padded with (notso) alternate mixes. But taken together, they illuminate the rapidity of Bowie's evolution between the album's conception and its promotion, from an embryonic demo version of \"Space Oddity\" (sung in a higher register and different meter) to the superior, strippeddown versions of \"An Occasional Dream\" and \"Freecloud\", the Marc Bolanbacked single version of eventual Aladdin Sane track \"The Prettiest Star\" and the protoSpiders From Mars swagger of \"London Bye TaTa\". And throughout it all, Bowie even found the time to learn another language, cutting a lyrically revised Italian version of \"Space Oddity\" (\"Ragazza Solo, Ragazza Sola\") to compete with a wave of successful cover versions in Italy. It 's hardly the most flattering portrait of a man who would go on to sell the world, but still a quaint keepsake from a time when he was just trying to blag his way through mainland Europe. "}
