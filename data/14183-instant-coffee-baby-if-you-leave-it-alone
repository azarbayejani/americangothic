{"label":" Moshi Moshi","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15235/homepage_large.5ffd047c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amy Granzin","artist":"The Wave Pictures","title":"Instant Coffee Baby","text":" \"Leave the Scene Behind\", a brisk pop song about an ordinary bloke who hooks up with a chick way out of his league, could be a companion piece to Art Brut's \"Good Weekend\". Like Eddie Argos, Wave Pictures singer and guitarist Dave Tattersall narrates improbable erotic developments with both wisecracks and wonder. But there's one crucial difference between the two songs: Tattersall gets dumped by the end. \"David you'll always be a baby brother/ You'll always be a mother's son/ You'll always be somebody's favorite pupil/ But you'll never be a man that I want,\" his socialclimbing paramour coolly explains. Ouch.\"Scene\" leads off the trio's first Moshi Moshi LP, Instant Coffee Baby (originally released in 2008 in the UK and now making its U.S. debut), and it gives a sneakpeek of what you're in for: keenly observed domestic tableaus, uniquely English perspectives on hubris and buffoonery, and ample instaquotes. Over the course of 13 tracks, Tattersall dribbles peach juice on his inlaws' sofa, steals a coffee machine, picks a fight with a marine (the marine wins), and claims he can write a better song than John Lennon. Comedy would be the path of least resistance, but Tattersall's a more subtle storyteller. He describes, for example, the rising sun as a \"pack of orange spaniels\" and awkward joy as \"a porcupine/ Sleeping on a waterbed\". Like sometime collaborators and fellow logophiles the Mountain Goats, the Wave Pictures write songs for fans of songwriting.The Wave Pictures share something else with John Darnielle's outfit. Their lyrics may be delicious, but the voice with which they're delivered an offpitch mash of Jonathan Richman, Gordan Gano and Morrissey can go down like a chunk of gristle. There's something to be said for the poignancy of Tattersall's cracked warble, but while a velvet croon isn't essential for folkpop singalongs like \"Friday Night in Loughborough\", it would definitely make \"Red Wine Teeth\"'s blueeyed soul more p  alatable. Depending on your taste, Tattersall's vocals could be a dealbreaker.Not surprisingly, Coffee's best when it's flush with rockabilly rhythms, sharp melodies, and the band's enthusiastic instrumental solos. For this reason, the Wave Pictures' lesseffusive next LP, If You Leave It Alone (which is being released concurrently with Coffee), isn't as fun or immediate. Both albums were recorded quickly and cheaply, but Alone has a slightly brooding demeanor and folkier sound. This approach works best on rippling altcountry pastiche \"Canary Wharf\" and whimsical, nursery schoolnostalgic songs like \"Bumble Bee\" and \"Bye Bye Bubble Belly\". But not so much on the long, dreary title track.Until now, the Wave Pictures, who have been playing together for almost 10 years, have stuck to their side of the pond. It's not hard to see why. Astute lyrics sung in an English accent have always been a tough sell in the U.S. If it helps, Americans might want to think about them this way. When asked in a recent interview to describe the group's sound, Tattersall replied, \"it's a band with songs, and guitar solos.\" "}
