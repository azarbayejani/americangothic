For this reason (and many others), I do not perform altcountry music in Norway. But apparently, what seems like common sense to me is nonsense to St. Thomas (aka Thomas Hansen), Norway's most popular altcountry artist. Language barriers? No barrier at all for this man. He is determined to bridge all cultural gaps and bring his Norwegian music to America in its native tongue. To wit: \"Oh, there are horses everywhere/ Little doggies barking at the chair/ Oh, please get out of my hair/ Small elephants doing their distance/ Well, what do I tell you now/ Will you ever know somehow/ Please do not understand/ That I am a normal man.\" For those of you not yet overcome by profound grief, take this: \"Emily Lang has got me so far/ It can't get it any worse/ Emily Lang is in my head/ And I am in her purse.\" In her purse! Oh, empathize for poor St. Thomas. For a number of years, Hansen toiled as a postman, but something hit him namely, the twin muses Will Oldham and Elliott Smith, whose music prompted Hansen to leave the letters behind in pursuit of his singer/songwriter dreams. So far, the choice has paid off well, as he's scored topten pop singles and critical acclaim throughout his homeland. This attention caught the eye of U.S. label Misra, who picked up I'm Coming Home for a stateside release. Sure, the Smith/Oldham influence is apparent, but even more apparent (and less egregious) is an uncanny resemblance to After the Gold Rushera Neil Young. The falsetto warble St. Thomas employs sounds not unlike Young performing on \"The Muppet Show\" with the Swedish Chef harmonizing. I could forgive this if it were somewhat modified (something like how Doug Martsch and Jason Lytle and Wayne Coyne do it), but Hansen gives us a straight impersonation. This, coupled with his cribbed song structures, make it clear he's still trying to figure it all out. Ditto for the music: while the opener, \"The Cool Song\", has a catchy, campfire appeal that, combined with its urgent, compact melody, impels sympathetic footstomping, a background of curious percussion, fiddles and a drum circle on \"Bookstore\" are pure essenseofOldham. Hansen then tops this off with a chirping vocal performance, and though the music is dense, uniformly well executed and nicely produced, it's ultimately unremarkable given its inspiration. The guy's just aping his mentors, illequipped to blaze his own path. But St. Thomas is likely just getting warmed up. If nothing else, he's committed to his genre and has a decent pedigree. It's even possible that, if his English improves, he may rise above the kitsch factor for which he is quite obviously exploited. "}
