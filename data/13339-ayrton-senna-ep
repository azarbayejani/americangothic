Not because a rising lofi rocker acted stupidly who doesn't sometimes? but because I'd always imagined being on ecstasy in Barcelona would be a lot more fun. After all, some of the most rewarding music from the last couple of years basically promised as much. Or was Swedish imprint Sincerely Yours being insincere? How about U.S. labels True Panther and Underwater Peoples? From Oslo to Melbourne, from indie rockers to club kids, sunny electronic euphoria has been one of the late2000s pop underground's richest musical nodes.Just as that endless blissedout summery vibe unites everyone from Panda Bear to Todd Terje, Barcelona electropop fourpiece Delorean pull up at the intersection between several disparate and exciting movements. Start with their remixes: In the U.S., the bedroom pop of Glasser and discopunk of Lemonade; in the UK, the NMEapproved guitar rock of the Big Pink and Mystery Jets; and, right in Delorean's hometown, the sampleheavy tropical psych of El Guincho. They can be as airy and suave as Air France or Phoenix, but their unremitting beats are also plenty huge enough to convert fans of Cut Copy or MGMT. John Talabot, a Barcelona DJ who's released cosmic disco grooves for Munich label Permanent Vacation, lends a house remix to the group's current EP, Ayrton Senna.The third release on Fool House, the new label from French indiedance blog Fluo Kids, Ayrton Senna represents a similar kind of convergence. In the early 2000s, Delorean originally set out to be something like Jimmy Eat World crossed with Elliott Smith, keyboardist Unai Lazcano confided to The Pop Manifesto magazine last summer. By the time of their promising Transatlantic KK album a couple of years ago, Delorean had absorbed the synthpop sleekness of New Order and the echoey guitar spikes of postpunk revivalists like !!! or the Rapture, with one transcendent moment: socalled \"breakhop\" finale \"Apocalypse Ghetto Blast\". On the Ayrton Senna EP, the group's burgeoning dancepop savvy comes into bloom with three unstoppable summer bangers, the Talabot remix, and a digitalonly bonus cut.Despite their rock roots, Delorean do tracks, not songs. Singer/bassist Ekhi Lopetegi is a Ph.D. candidate with a background in philosophy, but Delorean use his Factoryready yelp more as just another element to loop than as a vehicle for delivering lyrical content. \"Seasun\" is the best example of Delorean's layered approach to composition, methodically building 1990s pianohouse keyboards, disembodied female vocals, Baltimore clubready handclaps, and a ringing guitar line into the ultimate beach house (not Beach House). But \"Deli\", with its breakbeats and youthful enthusiasm, and \"Moonson\", all 90shouse liberation and anthemrock yearning, are almost as thrilling. Talabot's \"Kids & Drum\" remix of \"Seasun\" could well hold up after even more listens than the original version, its handpercussion samples reaching closer to the islands but its vast, clean lines stretching out toward space.Prior to Ayrton Senna, arguably Delorean's most compelling release was its remix for oftmisunderstood electropop Serge Gainsbourgs the Teenagers. On last year's occasionally brilliant Reality Check, the French band's \"Love No\" is a hilarious, sleazy, and brutally scathing snipe at a nagging girlfriend who disapproves of the narrator's selfabsorbed internet stonerdom. Delorean's bassheavy \"No Love\" version like Studio's \"Possible\" rework of the Shout Out Louds' \"Impossible\", only more dramatic strips away all the negative lyrics, ditching a chorus of \"I'm not in love\" and instead repeating the big question: \"Are you in love?\" Well, that's a hell of a thing for a pop song to ask. The track promises dancefloor absolution, only to nag at the heart in a way the Teenagers' lame girlfriend never could.Summer always ends too soon, and before long I'm sure beachy dance music will sound as cloying as rock fans considered the Beach Boys by the late 1960s. Like Wavves in Barcelona, Delorean recognize there's a dark side to their ecstatic vision, the aching truth that utopia literally, \"no place\" can never totally be fulfilled. As equally impressive bonus track \"Big Dipper\" puts it: \"Babe, if you want to we could run away up into the sun/ But we would only fade from black to black.\" Delorean's similarities to other \"sunny\", \"shimmering\" new artists, ultimately, are far less important than their similarities to other practitioners of wellcrafted and instantly gripping pop.
