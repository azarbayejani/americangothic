After two hours and 13 bottles of Stella Artois, I had placed myself into an awkward situation. On top of a table, my first thought was \"jump like Rod Strickland\" but eventually I created a comedic rap about Canadian politics. Although I managed to rhyme \"go Paul Martin\" with \"no hard coughing,\" the crowd was thoroughly disenchanted by my performance. This goes to show just how difficult it is to achieve simultaneous success as a humorist and a rapper on his debut, Original Rudebwoy, Mighty Casey succeeds in the former. Boston rappers have a strong history of being either painfully technical (Esoteric, Mr. Lif) or incredibly rudimentary (Guru), and Mighty Casey falls squarely into the second camp. He has an oldschool style with a simple nature that lends itself well to party rap. His delivery sounds labored at times but in some instances, his hurried, measured lyrical displays seem charming. Lyrically, Casey makes up for his lack of technical ability with a hilarious personality. For instance, on \"White Girls\" (loosely based on the Grandmaster Flash classic \"White Lines\", and the theme song to the new Wayans Brothers movie White Chicks), he claims, \"Used to like Mariah 'til I learned she was mixed\", while \"Black Rapping School\" features a repetitive bridge that sarcastically intones, \"I sell crack!\" Although \"White Girls\" is the song that made Casey's rep on the BET Uncut circuit, the album standout comes with \"Liquorland Part 2\". The concept is a wordplay clinic in the tradition of GZA's \"Labels\", where Casey invokes the names of various alcohols and corporations in creative ways. Over the span of the song, he gets political (\"I bought a 100 shots, took 59 to swallow/ Poured out 41 for Amadou Diallo\"), details his favorite measurements (\"I like girls thick like Guinness with big cans like Foster's\") and exhibits patriotism (\"If I stop drinking then the terrorists win\"). Coupled up with a beat whose playful piano loop comes courtesy of The Cure's \"The Lovecats\", this track offers Casey's most competent vocal performance, and is untouched elsewhere on Original Rudebwoy. The tone of the production a dependence on traditional boombap in the style of DJ Premier is consistent throughout the album. Standouts include the reggae horn dubsplash of \"Black Rapping School\", the chopped chimes and trumpet of \"Original Rudebwoy\" and the slomo vocal sample and chopstick piano of \"One Night Stand\". Although Casey would sound incredible over the more technical production of JZone or The Beatnuts, the beats he has now are solid enough for his purpose. To get a sense on the kind of artist Mighty Casey is, the press kit comes with a fact sheet detailing his cultivation of a pencil moustache and a Mighty Casey coloring page contest. Obviously, he doesn't take music too seriously. Still, the failings of his debut are apparent: The album is too short (there are only nine original songs), its choruses are often incredibly, brutally offkey, and Casey's awkward delivery is sometimes distracting. That said, if you're looking for a good time short of getting up on a table, maybe Mighty Casey is for you. "}
