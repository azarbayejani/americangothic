{"label":" Wide Hive","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/426/homepage_large.a0f58ec9.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jonathan Zwickel","artist":"Azeem / Variable Unit","title":"Mayhem Mystics","text":" Illbient, broken beat, downtempo, triphop, yadda yadda yadda. Let's cut to the chase, okay? If there's improvisation with actual instruments, it's jazz; if there are rhymes, it's hiphop. Both elements, however, blend into a technoir soundscape that's equally sensual and gripping on this 13track debut from longtime San Francisco collaborators Azeem and Variable Unit. Instrumental hiphop has made great advances in the past couple years, but Azeem's lyrical surrealism and V.U.'s subdued atmospherics smolder with an urgency that's far more experimental, and powerful, than most.Mainly responsible for the album's postmillennial tension are dual DJs Quest and Zeph, both fixtures of the West Coast turntablist community. These two lay shifting foundations of indeterminable effects that settle just long enough to anchor Variable Unit's expansive, moody grooves. Keyboardist Jacob Aginsky blows a futurefunk breeze through each tune, his Hammond and synth flights simultaneously anachronistic and progressive in tone. Matt Montgomery's bass is a fluid pulse, deftly strutting alongside Thomas McCree's laidback drumming to form a headnodding rhythm section that's appropriately understated and utterly hypnotic. Backed by Blackalicious vocalist Omega's sultry croon and occasional fullflavored horn flourishes, Variable Unit alternate between eerie minimalism and rubbery bounce that produces an innovative, deeply soulful slant.Some of Azeem's previous work with V.U. has come off as overly political and heavyhanded. A seriously conscientious and articulate MC, his fireandbrimstone rants can numb impatient ears eager for catchy hooks and booty bragging. On Mayhem Mystics, he waxes metaphysical, leading the band with easygoing, conversational rhymes and spiritual streamofconsciousness poetry. Were the mic in another MC's hands, \"Break It on Down\" might be an upbeat party starter; here, instead of the beat, Azeem breaks down our faltering society: \"War is inviting/ Peace is in hiding/ Factions uniting/ Lands are dividing/ Birds are migrating/ And pigs are now flying/ Everything's breaking on down.\" On \"Sound Field\", above Zeph's palette of electronic animal noises, Azeem spins scenes of new beginnings after an unavoidable apocalypse. He's intriguingly abstract: \"My heartbeat gives the tone of the jungle/ You alone the forest of light/ What lays beneath/ The creeping things/ The birds that fly/ The fish that swim/ Run along the river .\" The unbridled funk of \"What Is It?\" yields the album's most accessible track, as Azeem, putting a hand out to the initiated, chants, \"Put your wings on, tilt your halo to the side/ Strap on your time machine, let's go for a ride.\"Several of Mayhem Mystic's tracks run over five minutes, their length hinting at the groups' open, exploratory spirit, but at more than seven minutes, \"The Music Is the Medicine, So Let It In\" is easily the most ambitious. Featuring The Flecktones' Paul Hanson on bassoon and saxophone, the tune is a sprawling breakbeat journey that will leave listeners simultaneously unsettled and sedated, as Azeem intones, \"Crawling out of the TV, turning your forehead into a gray lens, experimenting. Beware the Illuminati, they are even watching you now/ The Patriot Actors, the Patriot Actors.\" His dose of creepy, Wuaddled conspiracy is jarring, but the Middle Eastern vocals that float through the track carry it into dark, ambient terrain. The song captures the album's essence, hitting like a drug you've never tried blissfully hallucinatory in feel and startlingly vivid in imagery. "}
