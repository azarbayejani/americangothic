Like all verifiable Glasgow bands, Teenage Fanclub write seductive shrines to love and disenchantment, love and wanderlust, sometimes just love and more love. Needless to say, at some point soon after 1991's heralded masterpiece Bandwagonesque, the 90s had to make their choice: rock songs about Scottish sunsets or rock songs about antichrists and bad sarcasm. In retrospect, we made the wrong decision. In the modern age, the only time you'll hear of Teenage Fanclub is in a sentence explaining how back in the early 90s, this music was somehow eroded by Nevermind. That's just lazy musical genealogy. The roots of this band stretch deep into the soil of Britpop and indie rock as we now know it. Witness \"The Concept\", the first song on both Bandwagonesque and this new bestof. The wry, affably pretentious, pseudoantisatirironic first line alone (\"She wears denim wherever she goes/ Says she's going to get some records by the Status Quo\") was as influential for 90s indie rock as any of the great songs of its time. There's just enough feedback here to keep you from getting slammed against a locker when playing it too loud outside gym class; the twinkling \"oh yeah\" chorus draws equally upon The Beatles and bands mocking The Beatles; and the drawling twominute guitar solo enjoins the world to call it the Scottish \"November Rain\". On Bandwagonesque, the band's three strong songwriters (Norman Blake, Gerard Love, and Raymond McGinley) formed like a genteel, slightly nebbish Voltron and rocked more Big Star allusions than a Texas patriot. \"What You Do to Me\" would be indistinguishable from some of the songs on Radio City except Fanclub churns them out more melodically and cheerfully, and at a volume that would decapitate Alex Chilton. By 1993's Thirteen, the band would attempt nthwave grunge and find that they were simply too brilliant to pull it off: \"Hang On\" opens like some ripoff of a Stone Temple Pilots hit before an uncomfortably inevitable slide into flakes of white noise and scaling strings. 1995's Grand Prix was slightly better, but even while the acoustic ballad \"Mellow Doubt\" featured lyrics as dumb and endearing as the best Big Star track, much of the record felt like weaker material from Bandwagonesque, with impotent songwriting and dismal performances. Their last two albums, Songs from Northern Britain and Howdy!, have been fairly hitormiss, and Four Thousand Seven Hundred and SixtySix Seconds does an admirable job of compiling the best of these: \"I Don't Want Control of You\" is a brass rendition of a theme to an imaginary 60s sitcom. \"Planets\" is a bizarrely dispiriting and hopeful space anthem with silly lyrics and orchestral crescendos. And, though this is a band clearly indebted to several major influences, there's always a song like \"My Uptight Life\", which idiosyncratically pairs what sounds like a phosphorescent theremin with backup harmonies that cynically say, \"Cynicism's a box I don't want to be in.\" There are three new songs as well, all comparable in quality to the \"hits.\" The band is softer here, more interested in song structure than feedback or atmosphere. The standout is \"The World'll Be OK\", a dance number that brings oscillating chords to drums, handclaps, and a dejected performance that belies the song's optimism. There are, of course, complaints that the compilers neglected \"Alcoholiday\" or \"Ret Liv Dead\", but with 21 tracks in 80 minutes, this is probably the first and last Teenage Fanclub record you're likely to need. More than 75% of the album consists of some of the best melodies the 90s ever produced melodies Blur, Oasis, and Radiohead would have orchestrated entire \"grunge revolutions\" in order to prevent you from hearing.
