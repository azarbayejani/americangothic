On the followup to 2009's sleeper hit Reservoir, Fanfarlo bring forth songs that are capably performed, professionally produced, and have the kind of perky melodies and implied optimism that would suggest the London quintet get along really well with each other. I'd have no reason to dissuade you from Rooms Filled With Light if time and money weren't limited resources in determining whether a record was worth a listen. Which is sort of the problem: None of this can counter that Rooms Filled With Light most often feels \"good\" only because it's \"not bad,\" existing at the center of a galaxy of bands used as exemplars of \"boring indie,\" but only serving as a mirror that reveals their idiosyncracies, where Fanfarlo simply have good intentions and risk aversion. Strange then, since Fanfarlo seem to aspire to darker and difficult territory than Reservoir, a record whose success ultimately felt like the result of new Arcade Fire and Beirut albums' being only theoretical at that time. They trade pofaced folkiness for influences of distinguished new wave haircuts and the production touch of Ben Allen, who of course helmed Merriweather Post Pavilion and Halcyon Digest, but more relevantly, a shockingly vital album from former UK bantamweights Bombay Bicycle Club. Though minor cosmetic changes, they result in Rooms Filled With Light's playing out as the sonic equivalent of deciding to major in Economics, mildly ambitious, but ultimately pragmatic about having a set path to success. This strategy pays off in the subtly ingratiating first half: \"Deconstruction\" is \"angular\" done by squares, its new romantic pulse and wobbly surf guitar chords never shaking it too far from its sweet, Neon Biblelite center. Likewise, Fanfarlo usually like to ease into their hooks, so the hearty chorus of \"Lenslife\" is a genuine surprise in its urge to stand up and be counted while \"Tunguska\" ekes into Dexys territory with its woozy saxophone arrangements and spirited harmonies. But as Room Filled With Lights crosses a Peanutsstyled piano interlude (\"Everything Turns\") into a Side B of songs as familiar and interchangeable as their titles (\"Feathers\", \"Bones\", \"Dig\"), you just come away thinking that the demand for fussy orchestral indie of this type is constant, whereas Fanfarlo are simply supply. From where does the love of Fanfarlo spring when Rooms Filled With Light never shoots for the power of populism nor something wholly individual? The crackedwhip cadence Simon Balthazar employs over the staccato violins on \"Replicate\" and \"Tightrope\" is too similar to Win Butler to not be a distraction, especially since he can't commit to sounding truly unhinged or making bold declarations rather than pat musings (\"We have a better chance on paper/ So we catalog our lives\"). So when Balthazar pleas to \"break it up into pieces/ Throw away what we don't understand\" on \"Deconstruction\", the conservatism of the latter half rings more true despite a propulsive, downstroked bassline. Meanwhile on \"Feathers\", Balthazar repeats, \"It is the same/ And the river is the siren/ And the rock before the time you washed up feeling nothing at all,\" enough to suggest he meant it as a singalong, but it fails to generate urgency. That, and the song piggybacks the same exact melody as Neon Indian's decidedly roustabout \"Terminally Chill\". Look, I know this kind of stuff is easy to dismiss as lame prima facie, especially if you can't possibly imagine perfectly reasonable listeners who don't need to go to SXSW to have confidence in their opinion that a dude tapping at a sampler while standing perfectly still is bullshit most of the time. And I agree with Larry Fitzmaurice's assessment from the festival that it's important to have music you \"like\" rather than the false binary of \"this rules\" and \"this sucks.\" But it seems to me that you seek out music you love, whereas likable music simply finds you. And so Rooms Filled With Light is friendly and nondescript, but so are the vast majority of the people you unconsciously encounter on a daily basis Rooms Filled With Lights is Jenny from a couple of cubicles over who wears cool shoes and watches \"30 Rock\", it's the guy who always nods hello when taking the treadmill next to you on Thursdays, it's the waiter at your local coffee spot who doesn't conduct himself like he'd rather be anywhere else on earth. Do they make things more pleasant? Sure, and I wouldn't rush to turn off the radio if \"Deconstruction\" came up either. But would you voluntarily spend 45 minutes with these people? Why haven't you?
