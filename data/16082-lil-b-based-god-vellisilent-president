The boast comes shortly after he's thrown out a revealing, eyebrowraising jab: \"I'm the reason you got your deal, bitch, A$AP.\" The line, and the fact that it's clearly true, says a lot about Lil B's unique perch in rap: Without ever abandoning the fringe, he's changed the mainstream conversation enough that rappers like A$AP Rocky can score sixfigure signings in part by copping B's producers and calling themselves \"pretty\" like he does. But Lil B isn't your standard neglected innovator, grousing in interviews about more successful rappers stealing his style: He's more popular than ever, still constantly retweeting requests from young girls begging him to \"fuck my bitches.\" For a cult rapper with no record deal, the extent of his influence is astonishing. BasedGod Velli and The Silent President, both released in the past month, will scan to most onlookers like Just More Lil B Mixtapes. It's an impression he doesn't always exactly work overtime to dismiss: After he ignited anÂ Internet firestorm last summer with his lovely, dazed I'm Gay, he followed it up with I Forgive You, a dareyoutogetthroughit teethgritter that worked like bug spray to anyone who'd just climbed on board. But while they lack the unifyingmoment ring of I'm Gay, BasedGod Velli and Silent President are both strong entries into the massive, bewildering Lil B canon. If you sit somewhere in the middle of the Lil Bobsessive spectrum, here's the shorthand: You probably need one or both of these. BasedGod Velli gets the edge over President, for focus and quality of production. The cover, which splits his face with Pac's, Face/Offstyle, might get a halfhearted rise out of some rap traditionalists somewhere, but it's difficult by now to imagine many of those types still being undecided about Lil B. He opens the tape up addressing this crowd: \"Niggas talk about 'Lil B done killed rap'/ Stupid bitch, man, I brought the rap game back.\" After that, he doesn't waste time defending himself against anyone. The rest of the tape is highquality #based music, nothing more, nothing less. Lil B is in openhearted truthteller mode on Velli: there are no gangstarap or pimprap exercises. At his best, Lil B uses his positivity like a bluntforce object, clearing out his lane in front of him with the heat of his convictions. Witness this remarkable tirade, also from the title track: \"It ain't hard to smoke weed and go tote gats/ It ain't hard to pimp hos, man you lame for that/ It ain't hard to rob a nigga at close range/ Much harder to go outside and use your brain/ Much harder to go to college and go get grades/ Much harder to get a job to go feed your seed/ Real easy to give up and go complain.\" This passage bears all the scuff marks of Lil B's withoutanet style it's artless, it's fumbling, the lines barely connect with a rhyming syllable at the end but it's a remarkable outpouring nonetheless. \"King Cotton\", which borrows the instrumental from Raekwon and Ghostface's \"Heaven & Hell\", is another highlight, a touching lament framed in the simplest and most direct possible of terms: \"How the fuck can I forget about the people hangin' off a tree/ For the simple fact they look like me?\" Those who write off B's style as mindless rambling could spend a chastening few hours watching other rappers' attempts at \"based\" freestyle: B's gift for turning up startling language inside himself with little to no preparation is uncanny. Silent President is less rewarding and more scattershot than BasedGod Velli. The beat selection and production are lower in quality, and B's realtime fumbling for words occasionally grows outright distracting. But there are some welcome moments: \"Great China Sea\" repurposes the only bit of Watch the Throne's \"Lift Off\" beat worth keeping the smooth coda and turns it into a parade of softly glowing Christmas lights for B to rap over. On \"The Based One\", he warbles over DJ Khaled/Drake/Rick Ross/Lil Wayne's \"I'm on One\". \"Cap Pillah\" and \"BasedGod 50\" are highly entertaining examples of ignorant Lil B, with gun threats and nonsequiturs thrown out over linoleumcurling beats. As usual, both tapes have moments of sheer irredeemable silliness: On President's \"Beat the Cancer\", he raps over a spedup loop of Metallica's \"Fade to Black\" and dedicates it to a terminally ill YouTube follower who requested it of him. It's a nice personal gesture but a profoundly ridiculous song (the chorus is \"beat the cancer, cancer.\") Ditto for BasedGod Velli's \"I Got AIDS\", which doubles down on Lil B's personal spittake title sweepstakes and offers a message song so bluntly literal it inspires mostly disbelieving laughs (\"on top of that, she gave me herpes when she gave me AIDS!\"). What makes them work, though, is their place within the larger Lil B world: His pratfalls are offered up with the same fearless generosity as his triumphs. Without them, we wouldn't feel the audacity of his creative highwire act. They're the price of entry into Based World, which is still a pretty transformative place to spend some time. "}
