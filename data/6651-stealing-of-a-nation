Through 2000's debut, The New Song and Dance LP and 2001's \"Dance to the Underground\" 12inch, Radio 4 followed their neoClash/Gang of Four tendencies into a more indiedanceable context, and it just about worked. Meshies dropped \"Radio 4\" in the same breath as The Rapture and !!!, and none of them were shocked when the band asked the DFA to produce their sophomore effort. The first half of Gotham! showcased the band's live energy with smart but spare embellishments, and preserved the grassroots vitriol that gave at least some credence to their incendiary political lyrics. The second half, however, felt like an afterthought: Its production is noticeably heavier on what are infinitely less compelling songs, as the DFA frantically lipstick and sunglass Bernie Lomax to conceal the album's rigor mortis. Despite it all, Astralwerks signed the band in 2003. Most would think Radio 4 would use this budget upgrade to trudge up some fresh material by now it had been two years since the band recorded Gotham! but they still couldn't muster the energy. Instead, we got the Electrify EP, which included a barely distinctive rerecording of 2001's \"Dance to the Underground\", and 6 consistently awful remixes. Radio 4 had written itself in water: That quickly, they'd become hasbeens, and from there, any headway made would go toward reclaiming lost ground.Stealing of a Nation is the polar opposite of monumental. Its 12 songs brutally follow the modus operandi of Electrify, in that all are simply thinly disguised rerecordings of \"Dance to the Underground\" each more obscene than the next. What's worse, the band doesn't have the indiedance acumen of James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy to fall back on anymore: Instead, there's Martin \"Max\" Heyes, whose dated Primal Screamisms drown out the band's already feeble melodies and political agenda. Radio 4 can be commended for at least trying to move past the purposeful lofi of Gotham! and into fresher territory, but there's no bell or whistle in the world that could energize the utterly impotent songs at the core of Stealing of a Nation. While Radio 4 whine about bands moving to New York for the wrong reasons (The Scene!) on album single and opener \"Party Crashers\", the band crashes a party themselves the pilled 'n' thrilled, screamadelic one across the pond that's been shut down for 13 years. The change of direction is not at all accidental even the title Stealing of a Nation aligns the band with New Order (who recorded both \"State of the Nation\" and \"Shame of the Nation\") and all of Manchester's postNew Order antics but come on, does every song after \"Party Crashers\" have to rip Happy Mondays' \"God's Cop\" and Primal Scream's \"Don't Fight It, Feel It\", too? Of course, the similarities between Radio 4 and producer Max Heyes' previous clients would be a less pressing issue if the band had any charisma whatsoever. It's difficult enough for frontman Anthony Roman to convincingly rally the troops against The Man and The Machine on \"(Give Me All of Your) Money\" and when his voice is swaddled in the purple robes of highgloss production, but his lazy threenote melodies couldn't even start a lunchroom food fight. Meanwhile, guitarist Tommy Williams and keyboardist Gerard Garone trade equally malnourished riffs on 9/11bynumbers \"State of Alert\", and Heyes' insistence on the drum machine on \"Transmission\" and \"The Death of American Radio\" keeps live drummer Greg Collins from contributing anything more than a credit in the liners. Two songs that Radio 4 intended as clear homage to their influences only further indict Stealing of a Nation. \"Nation\", which the band openly modeled in sound, political agenda, and track placement (right in the middle) after The Clash's \"Straight to Hell\" on Combat Rock, neatly reiterates all of Stealing of a Nation's shortcomings, from Heyes' outmoded soundboards to Roman's unconvincing, merely observational politics to the entire band's inability to write remotely compelling melodies. And then, right before the aptly titled closer \"Coming Up Empty\", Radio 4 dubstomps with unusual swagger through \"Dismiss the Sound\" with unmistakable similarity to \"Albatross\" by Public Image, Ltd., from whose song (\"Radio 4\") the band takes its name. But of course, Roman hardly skims the depth of Johnny Lydon's conviction, and Radio 4 sells off PiL's atonal confession for glitzy and insubstantial chorus effects. Like the rest of the album, the song's slickly produced fancy face also becomes its muzzle, robbing Radio 4 of any bite it could have had. Stealing of a Nation truly has nothing to offer musically, nor does Radio 4 urge anything of note politically, sticking to the trite \"America Is Fucked!\" hogwash that any seventh grader with a blog and a dialup could piss out in an afternoon. Never has a band been so undeserving of its own name. "}
