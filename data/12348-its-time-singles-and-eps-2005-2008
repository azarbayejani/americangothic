Singles and EPs 2005-2008","text":" Unlike so many bands currently adopting the same aesthetic, caUSE coMOTION! turn their musical ineptitude and shoddy equipment into a virtue. Singer/lead spazz Arno (first names only with these guys, Beat Happeningstyle) awkwardly hacks at a guitar unfit for a sixyearold, guitarist Alex gingerly picks out dinky lead lines that sound piped from a ColecoVision, and Jock whales on a single drum and tinny snare like he was Keith Moon to call their scrappy, endearing racket \"infectious\" would be underselling it. Seeing them live hits about five different irrational pleasure centers at once, and on record their raw energy is just as palpable. The three years' worth of messy, crayonscrawled punk singles collected on It's Time! each one well under two minutes marry the clatter of early Beat Happening and the Modern Lovers to the lovelorn dreaminess of Sarah Records wimps like Another Sunny Day.For these guys, amateurism is a matter of devotion, and they take great pains to reconstruct the innocent illusion of \"hey gang, let's form a band!\" Playing better instruments, or playing their pitiful instruments better, would be traitorous: In this worldview, learning to play properly is, as Lester Bangs memorably put it, a deadening process equivalent to \"the putrefaction of a corpse.\" Accordingly, the guitars on It's Time! sound like an aging cassette copy of Count Five's \"Psychotic Reaction\" taped by holding a Walkman up to the radio; Jock's single cymbal receives a bigger workout than a death metal drummer's doublekick; and Arno sings guilelessly and tunelessly about longing, confusion, and being misunderstood. It would be easy to lob some criticism about the artifice involved, or point out the inherent contradiction of paying such meticulous homage to Calvin Johnson's homemade DIY aesthetic, but these guys' sincerity, live or on record, cannot be doubted.Not to mention that their tunes are great; it's hard even to single out the catchiest. Guitarist Alex cooks up maddeningly simple little earworms for every song: Check the \"breakdown\" of \"Baby Don't Do It\" or the stumbling shuffle of \"This Time Next Year\" for prime examples. \"Don't You Know?\" pogos along joyfully on a burbling bassline and coffeepercolator drums, while Arno offers unadorned yearning worthy of Jonathan Richman: \"Please don't say 'oh no don't go'/ Oh don't you know when it's over, it stays that way?\" In case it wasn't clear from the song titles nearly half of them end in question marks Arno belongs to the grand tradition of lovelorn wusses that includes Richman, Rivers Cuomo, and the Descendents' Milo Aukerman. Thankfully, however, he doesn't seem to carry around these men's internalized rage. Even when he's imploring \"Do you have any feelings at all?\" on \"You Don't Say\", he doesn't sound bitter, just brokenhearted. \"Say what you feel, it's okay, no one will judge you,\" repeated over and over, run the entirety of the lyrics to \"Say What You Feel\", accompanied by a perfect threenote girlgroup guitar riff you don't get much sweeter or more gently encouraging than that. The lyric serves neatly as a statement of theme for these guys, and indeed for the purest, most inclusive impulses of all early punk rock, which caUSE coMOTION! summon effortlessly. "}
