They laundrylist the records released that week in 1972, ranging from a posthumous Jimi Hendrix LP to John Fahey, Tim Buckley, Bonnie Raitt, Nazareth, Wet Willie, and Martin Mull. To which Bobby Charles comments in his gentle, stoned Cajun drawl: \"It's too bad, a lot of good ones just have to get lost. It's unexplainable, but they just do.\" To which Hansen replies: \"Well... a lot of times they get picked up the second or third time around.\" Warm and crackling as a campfire, easeful and understated, all of it suffused with Charles' nuanced blend of humor and empathy, this 1972 eponymous album was one of the \"good ones\" that got lost. Think of this as the second or third time around for the album to finally find its people and there should be plenty of them. Considering that 4/5ths of the Band served as Charles' back up group here (augmented by Dr. John and Neil Young pedal steel guitarist Ben E. Keith), this is simply put one of the most sublime Americana records ever cut. Charles' story started two decades earlier, when he wrote and recorded R&B standards like \"See You Later, Alligator\" and \"Walking to New Orleans\". The story goes that Chess Records signed the then14yearold sight unseen after he sang them \"Alligator\" over the phone. When he arrived in their Chicago offices, though, Leonard Chess flipped out: Not because Charles was underage, but because he was white. After touring through a preintegration South, he wound up in Nashville by the late 1960s. A marijuana rap led him to head further north, where he ultimately fell in with the musical community centered around Woodstock, N.Y., recording at Dylan manager Albert Grossman's Bearsville Studios. From the opening twang and snare snap of \"Street People\", it's clear Charles' songwriting acumen had grown beyond his early R&B roots. Over the slinking beat, he details an itinerant life of what one would label a \"bum.\" But rather than spin some tale of hard luck and woe, Charles makes drifting from town to town and panhandling for spare change sound idyllic. \"Wouldn't trade places with no one I know/ I'm happy with where I'm at,\" he drawls. A cowbell accents the punchline: \"Some people would rather work/ We need people like that.\" Elsewhere, there are organgurgling numbers about new love and community gossip, lilting ballads about watching butterflies, honking barroom numbers about growing old, and gentle, countrytinged numbers about spending all day in bed with your honey. And then there's the ode to Jesus to save him from his followers. All of it gets delivered with a sly grin and at a pace with which you might sip a beer on a back porch, cast a fishing line into a creek, or barbecue a rack of ribs: slow, unhurried, a sunny afternoon ahead of you. Some 25 previously unreleased tracks augment the original 10song album, ranging from the pleasant to revelatory. There are differently mixed singles, three songs released only on a Japanese box set, some halfbaked songs, but also the sound of Charles' shuffling toward a followup album that he never quite got around to finishing. Or, as he put his M.O. on one chorus: \"(I'm) staying stoned and singing homemade songs.\" There's the Band's telltale funk on \"Why Are People Like That?\", Dr. John's piano commingling with Garth Hudson's gospel organ swells on the elegant crest of \"You Came Along\". Fans of Will Oldham's Arise Therefore will swoon for demos of Charles dueting with the Band's Rick Danko over a sputtering drum machine. When this set was originally made available through Rhino Handmade back in August (it's in stores now via distribution partner Light in the Attic), midalbum track \"He's Got All the Whiskey\" was already an album highlight. So it's uncanny hearing both it and \"Street People\" in a postOccupy mindset. About as loud as \"Chappelle's Show\"'s intro, Dixieland horns, Danko's bass, and a snare's pop skitter about as Charles gripes: \"He got all the money.\" It, of course, follows that \"The Man\" also has all the \"whiskey/ power/ women,\" the biggest crime of it being that \"he won't give me none.\" It's a simple protest from Bobby Charles goodnatured at its heart and hopefully it won't get ignored this time around.
