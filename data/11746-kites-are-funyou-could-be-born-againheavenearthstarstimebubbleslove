Comprised of three of four Dedrick siblings (Chris, Bruce and Sandy), they specialized in a similar style of folk as peers Peter, Paul & Mary. However, doubtlessly due to main songwriter Chris' classical music studies, their music was decidedly ornate and their vocal harmonies precise and complex. The group quickly recorded a twosong demo and just as quickly were courted by labels quick to capitalize on the success of other \"harmony groups\" like the Beach Boys and Simon & Garfunkel. The Free Design subsequently found a home with independent easylistening label Project 3, who promised greater creative freedom than the others. Unfortunately, the group failed to land a hit, likely due in part to the label's inexperience promoting pop acts. Now, nearly 40 years later, Light In the Attic Records has reissued the band's first four LPs, revealing a band unfairly slept on. The band's 1967 debut Kites Are Fun placed them squarely in the realm of sunshine pop acts like The Association and Curt Boettcher and Gary Usher's Sagittarius, but with the unmistakably precious Greenwich Village sound. Its songs are uniformly well arranged and performed, sparkling with some of the clearest sound of the era, and are also consistently pleasant and inoffensive, offering an amiable take on the counterculture's message of peace, love and freedom. The Free Design make no bones about their wholesome convictions in the title track: \"We'd like to be a zillion miles away from everyone/ 'Cause Mom and Dad and Uncle Bill don't realize Kites Are Fun.\" The intricate vocal lines, using sophisticated harmonies normally associated with jazz or chamber classical music, carry out its beyondinnocent charms. \"The Proper Ornaments\" adds in \"baba\" vocal counterpoint reminiscent of the Beach Boys and The Mamas & the Papas, in addition to a baroque arrangement featuring harpsichord and trumpets; it's as refined a piece of music as was released in the decade, though did the band no favors in hipper circles. The following year, The Free Design released You Could Be Born Again, adding youngest sister Ellen to the lineup. Having another voice allowed Chris to write more complex vocal arrangements, but otherwise, the album is very similar to the debut. It features several covers of current pop hits, including \"California Dreamin'\", The Beatles' \"Eleanor Rigby\", The Turtles' \"Happy Together\" and Burt Bacharach's \"The Windows of the World\" and despite the brash dualtrumpet solo attack on the Mamas & the Papas tune, these songs contribute to a faceless professionalism that diminishes the album's impact. Chris Dedrick provides the most distinctive music, especially the gorgeous \"Ivy on a Windy Day\". Opening with a ghostly choral section, the song eventually settles into soft pop, featuring an unusual chord sequence that wouldn't sound out of place on recent Stereolab records in fact, Laetitia Sadier has cited the band as one of her alltime favorites. The reissue appends two nonLP bonus tracks: an easylistening holiday ballad \"Christmas Is the Day\" and the oddly titled \"Close Your Mouth (It's Christmas)\".Heaven/Earth was released in 1969, and for the most part continues the soft, psychedelic pop of the first two records. \"You Be You and I'll Be Me\" spices up a typically elaborate vocal arrangement with an uptempo, percussive rock groove and a horn chart similar to concurrent Blood, Sweat & Tears or Chicago. However, the surprisingly cynical \"2002: A Hit Song\" provides the most spark on the record, suggesting that The Free Design weren't satisfied with their niche market. The singers outline a brief formula for a charttopper (directed to the \"teenyboppers\"), only to admit in frustration, \"We did all this last time, and it did not work.\" Elsewhere, the funky jazz take on George Gershwin's \"Summertime\" offers evidence that the band were willing to step out of the mold they'd crafted for themselves. The reissue includes both sides of a solo single by Ellen Dedrick and several tracks featuring the band as backing singers for a 1968 LP by future musicmogul Tommy Mottola. 1970's Stars/Time/Bubbles/Love was The Free Design's best album to date, and also the first one to explore rock and funk with the same gusto as their already wellestablished brand of soft pop. \"Bubbles\" is its bestknown song, and for good reason: The aggressive, oddmetered force of bass and drums, supported by clavinet and modestly searing electric guitar, propel Chris' ace vocal arrangement into similar territory as The Fifth Dimension and The Millennium, but with a crisper, jazzier edge. \"Butterflies Are Free\" is softer, but equally as engaging, due especially to the gloriously regal arrangement of vocals and brass on the fadeout. Best yet is \"That's All, People\", with deceptively dissonant harmonies and an explosive big band performance. The Free Design released two more LPs in the early 1970s (Sing for Very Important People and One by One) that will hopefully be reissued soon. Although the band's sound epitomized \"square\" at the time, its impact is obvious in the work of modern sophistipoppers Stereolab, Cornelius, Manitoba, The High Llamas and Belle & Sebastian. They were overlooked the first time around, but The Free Design make more sense now than ever. "}
