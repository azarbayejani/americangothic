Of course, Laments for Love did have a gnarly locked groove that would repeat \"Bush is a dickhead\" until you picked up the stylus into abaddon indeed. Today Saviours talk more about \"this burning plane of Earth,\" although \"Firewake Angel\"'s \"unearthed beast\" might well be how you'd describe Bush after six more years of acid tabs. Their particular corner of this burning plane remains Oakland, where bassist and Drunk Horse axslinger Cyrus Comiskey shares an apartment with High on Fire's Matt Pike. Into Abaddon, like 2006's Crucifire, borrows some from the Pike catalogue, speeding up the unruly weededout riffs Pike played in Sleep, setting them to HoF's dbeat pummel. But, like fellow hardcore vets Tragedy, Saviours still retain a kind of careening punk DNA in their sound; Batiste, lurching from one sludgy trapdoor to the next doublebass gallop, is too versed in the dynamic hurdles of his old outfits to spend much time sticking with any one part, no matter how much it might slay. It's that California Swing Kids swing, stretched out to slow motion. Since Crucifire, Barber's shaved a few registers off his voice, tarnishing it with what sounds like the most epic tourvan cold of all time. \"Into Abaddon\" shudders with rolling drum unfurlings, boozy shouts, and bearded backing vocals. \"Mystichasm\" starts out like the band's trying to pin the insufficiently faithful to an opposite wall. Chalk some of the heft here up to Melvins/Tool producer \"Evil\" Joe Barresi, who's got to be the guy responsible for the wicked lowend that bashes along during \"Cavern of Mind\"'s wahedout guitar solo. In almost every song comes that moment of payoff where Saviours clear space around Barber's ravaged throat and plummet into a howling, halftime breakdown. Barber shouts \"UNHOLY SEAL\" just as his band drops through it.  Anyone familiar with the teetotaling basementshow grind out of which Saviours emerged should be able to spot how vengefully the pendulum is now swinging back. Saviours retail on Kemado, the same label as the Sword, but their greasy Mot√∂rhead appropriations have the messy punk momentum absent from the Sword's mannered, denimclad reenactments. In Barber and Batiste's pasts are no shortage of straightedge band members and underpowered amplifiers. They're now furiously making up for both.  "}
