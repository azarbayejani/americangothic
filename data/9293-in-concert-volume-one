Deusner","artist":"The Sadies","title":"In Concert Volume One","text":"  Like a surfing cowboy wearing a Nehru jacket, the Sadies' music blends elements of country & western, Americana, surf, and garage rock. But nowhere in their catalog do these elements gel quite so perfectly as on their new live album, In Concert Volume One, which they recorded over two nights at Lee's Palace in their hometown of Toronto. That this is a highlight for the band shouldn't be surprising. In addition to their wideranging musical sources, the Sadies are renowned as an electric live act, and In Concert is a persuasive argument that the stage, not the studio, is the natural place to hang their hats and wax their boards. So of course it's a double album. And of course it's a doozy. The Sadies pretty evenly split the discs between their own songs and covers. The first disc features the band mostly drawing from all their albums and featuring the austere vocals of Dallas Good. From the opening note, the Sadies sound more confident and directed than on their admittedly sturdy studio albums, running through lean, fierce versions of \"Cheat\" and \"Why Be So Curious?\" and tackling the Band's \"Leave Me Alone\" and Bob Wills' western swing classic \"Stay a Little Longer\" with excitable energy. It takes them only 30 seconds to rumble through \"16 Mile Creek\", and barely three minutes for most other tracks. It's a tight set and the only bum number is \"Higher Power\", a traditional song they recorded for their album Pure Diamond Gold. Despite Larry Good's barreling banjo, the gospel callandresponse sounds soggy compared to the crisp concision of the rest of the show. If the Sadies prove an impressive live band, this collection suggests that they might be even more remarkable as a versatile backing band, a pack of mercenaries able to compliment a range of guest vocalists while disappearing behind them. On the second disc of In Concert, they support some of the usual suspects: Jon Langford, Kelly Hogan, Andre Ethier, Neko Case, Gary Louris, Jon Spencer and Matt VertaRay of Heavy Trash, and Rick White of Elevator and the Sadies side project the Unintended. The Sadies give themselves over to Spencer's grandstanding on \"Back Off\" and \"Her Love Made Me\" and even rev up VertaRay's much stronger \"Justine Alright\". With Jon Langford they blast through \"American Pageant\" and \"Strange Birds\", and Gary Louris does a surprisingly solid job of memorializing Syd Barrett on the cover of \"Lucifer Sam\". But the Sadies' best collaborator remains Neko Case: In addition to replicating the lively desperation of her own \"Hold On Hold On\", they stomp through two Roger Miller covers, the spirited \"Home\" and the swinging encore \"Jason Fleming\", nicely complimenting her brassy vocals but never distracting from her formidable stage presence. In Concert ends with a bravado cover of the Mekons' \"Memphis, Egypt (Eagle Bauer's Rock & Roll)\", sung by Langford (obviously) but featuring the Sadies and almost all their guests. It's one of the set's finest moments, not just for the song's headlong momentum or even for its reclaimrock lyrics. Rather, this bravado finale showcases all the musicians catching that gigantic riff like it's the wave of a lifetime and shredding the hell out of it.  "}
