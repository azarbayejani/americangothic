{"label":" Dead Oceans","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/16146/homepage_large.41dc11fc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amanda Petrusich","artist":"Akron/Family","title":"Akron/Family II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT","text":" In the pantheon of oddball origin stories, the legend of Akron/Family's fifth LP should rank high: After a slew of ignored deadlines, a cardboard box containing \"four blown out song fragments on a TDK CDR in a ziplock bag, three pictures, and a typewritten note\" landed on Dead Oceans' doorstep along with a \"sincere but poorly made diorama.\" (The note contained helpful phrases such as \"Do Not Erase / I Was Ak / Flourish.Flourish.Flourish./ Fuck Shit Up.\"). Somehow, that crate of detritus ultimately coalesced into Akron/Family II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT, a record purportedly written in a cabin built into the side of an active volcano in Akan National Park in Hokkaido, Japan and recorded in an abandoned train station in Detroit. Whether all that's true or not, everyone appreciates a good bit of mythmaking, and it's a fitting narrative for a record that plays like a scifi novel: Listen long enough and you'll hear volcanoes, old trains, purple lights, and Detroit summer, all tangled up with snippets of found sound and goofy lyrics about worms. There are plenty of global influences here, from Brazilian fuzz to Japanese noise, but Akron/Family's always been most interested in repurposing ancient American folk music, and they pull from Harry Smith's famed Anthology of American Folk Music as much as anything else. Like compatriots Animal Collective, MV & EE, and the NoNeck Blues Band, Akron/Family manage to make even the most familiar refrains like the singthevowels opening of \"A AAA O A WAY\" sound deeply strange. The band, which splits time between New York City and Portland, Oregon, lost founding member Ryan Vanderhoof in 2007 (he left to enter a Buddhist Dharma center); they soldiered on as a trio. Since Vanderhoof's departure, the band's M.O. has become increasingly tricky to define (they can riff like the Kinks see \"So It Goes\", especially or meander like early Tower Recordings, depending on the track), but they're at their best when they're shooting for some kind of ecstatic high.  The spastic, shimmering \"Another Sky\" is the album's glowing center; it streaks out of your speakers like an aurora borealis. \"The first light of the morning echoes the song in my heart,\" quasifrontman Seth Olinsky sings in his thin, easy voice (it nicely balances the roughness of his distorted guitar). Light is a reoccurring notion here, both lyrically and musically almost all of these songs open up like fireworks, leaving a shower of sparks. Akron/Family II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT is a curious collage (not unlike that box of stuff), but its eclecticism ends up being one of its greatest assets.  Organic and jubilant, it successfully weaves psych, world, rock, and folk traditions into something new and endlessly compelling.
