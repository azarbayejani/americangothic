By extension, the Stratford 4 also deserve an objective evaluation once in a while. It just so happens for the Stratford 4 that \"once in a while\" is right now. To assist me in my evaluation, I will employ the circa 198188 Fairfax County, Virginia elementary school report card. In the 1980s, Fairfax County report cards allowed for great flexibility and detail; abstract performance ratings for *inter alia*, attitude, ability and attentiveness supplemented the standard AF for coursework, ranging from H (high achievement), to U (unsatisfactory), with S (satisfactory) and N (needs improvement) filling in the gaps. It's these abstract ratings that I find most appropriate for music, and which I will utilize here. Ready? right now, I'm the one who matters, because I own your ass. Okay, that was a bit strong, but you get my point. A jewel case and liner notes can go a long way. Band Composition: H. Female bassist, female drummer. And better yet, the ladies are not just a novelty to draw horny teenage fans (although we're not ruling that possibility out if I had some damn liner notes, maybe I could tell you conclusively). One of these guys was also in an earlier incarnation of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, whatever that's worth to you. Sound: S. The Stratford 4 alternates between pop (\"All Mistakes Are Mine\"), noisepop (\"Displacer,\" \"Hydroplane\") and just plain noise (\"Window Open,\" \"All That Damage\"). The label pays mouth homage to the band by comparing their pop tendencies to the Velvet Underground and Yo La Tengo. For once, that's about right; it's all solid and wellexecuted, without sounding too much like either of the above. The noisier tunes include narcotic psychedelia, as on the bluesy \"Window Open,\" and more commonly, charged, ethereal guitars, like those that interject between verses on the lazy, sentimental indielove number, \"Rebecca.\" Songwriting: N. Great albums include one or two songs properly deemed GradeA mix tape material. As far as I can tell,  The Revolt Against Tired Noises  has a few that come close (\"Hydroplane\" is the best candidate), but none that quite reach the CD burner. In terms of pop, the songs could use a secondhelping of catchiness, especially the melodies. The noisier numbers inch a little closer, especially \"Rebecca\" and \"All That Damage,\" but are not as gripping, affected or hypnotic as they probably could be. Fake British Accent: U. Assuming singer Chris Streng truly is from San Francisco, there is no need for this. Overall Performance: S.  The Revolt Against Tired Noises  is a pretty good album, and sounds like it would translate very well to a live show. With modest improvement and a little hard work, next time the Stratford 4 might be looking at an H. Have a fun summer. "}
