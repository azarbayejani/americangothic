The subarctic north imposes with its icy grandeur; near Stockholm a national park sprawls over 300yearold virgin forest. The south is typically temperate. So too Amandine's spacious folkpop, which like its place of origin is probably slightly bigger than California and provides a higher standard of living than good ol' Bushworld by most measures. On This Is Where Our Hearts Collide, Amandine roam across a vast and chilly plain, tumbling guitars and graceful bearing aligning them with the windswept Americana of Sun Kil Moon, Songs:Ohia, or preZ My Morning Jacket. The arrangements are spare yet skywide, occasionally visited by banjos, accordions, glockenspiels, and theremin. \"Stitches\" emerges from the previous track's halting piano to survey the tundra with crunching Neil Young licks and mournful, distant trumpet. Yet singer Olof Gidlöf's trembling whisper and easy sense of pop melody evoke a comfortable, hypothetical Sam BeamBen Gibbard collab. Gentle love song \"Easy Prey\" traces an elegant extended metaphor over a twirling arpeggio, Gidlöf sighing, \"With your paws upon my chest/ I'll be calm.\" Boundless horizons meet the intimate under uneasy harmonies. Meanwhile, even the most cinematic ballads smolder with weary sadness. The album title suggests emo, but the heartbreak is more permanent, without that genre's toocommon petulance. \"How much can you ask for before I start letting you down,\" goes the warm, stately chorus of \"Fine Lines\". After a lazy banjo intro, Gidlöf continues an unbearably lonely conversation  \"And we fell apart/ Like fathers and sons\"  on \"Fathers & Sons\". \"Firefly\" opens with a buzzing acoustic guitar rhythm out of Radiohead's \"Exit Music (for a Film)\" and plays the weepingviolins card nicely, aided by intertwined falsetto vocals and leftbehind drums. \"If it stings, it stings because it's true,\" Gidlöf sings. All in all, it's possibly what you'd hope for from a group of Swedes who originally called themselves Wichita Linemen, but more than you could expect. Don't know much else about Sweden, but This Is Where Our Hearts Collide is really about the complicated geography of hope and sorrow. Not a neutral country, exactly, but a worthy escape. "}
