On the heels of November's Ask Forgiveness EP, these releases risked giving off a \"Dear Fans: Thanks, also fuck off\"vibe, but since precisely no one's child is going Ivy League off of 10,000 copies of Wai Notes it's probably safe to assume we're being asked to pony up again in the name of Art.Wai Notes comes impeccably wrapped in stamped cardstock, its cover featuring a woman…in a woman suit, the backside boasting a glossy of a hambone Oldham sitting with The Letting Go collaborator Dawn McCarthy. What's not clear is why these 10 demos weren't packaged with their parent album instead of the more useful rarities disc Little Lost Blues, now difficult to obtain itself. The fickle nature of the Oldham cult all but assures that had Wai Notes preceded The Letting Go it would've been hailed as a return to sonically quaint beginnings; on at least two occasions Oldham sings the wrong lyric and immediately mutters a correction into the margin. And it is worth wondering why Oldham no longer makes records like \"The Signifying Wolf\", on which a tiny guitar unravels and exposes horny animal chants.But hell: The Letting Go, driven by Nico Muhly's tempest string arrangements, was the most clearly conceived record of Oldham's career. Airing the dirty laundry of sleepydog ballads like \"Then the Letting Go\" or \"I Called You Back\" does them no favors. Hearing Oldham tiptoe his way through \"Wai\" his fingers hang over chords, as if he's trying to remember the changes is thrilling in a voyeuristic sort of way, but Oldham's is a catalog that already contains its share of flubbed notes.Wilding is harder to pin down but seems more useful. Recorded live in \"central coastal California\" (no specific venue or date is named), Wilding is pressed by Oldham distributors PVine (Japan) and Spunk (Australia), and it's a bit difficult to sort out: Hagerty's unexplained \"remix\" work includes the random and indecipherable \"Naked Lion\" and, more intriguingly, a cutup of \"Lost Blues\" and \"God's Small Song\" deft enough to pass as one coherent piece. Ponder also the market that sees \"Little Small Song\"'s \"fuck\" intrusively censored but \"Naked Lion\"'s looped \"Yeah shit's hard\" given a pass.Wilding's tenuous cohesion still fares better than 2005's cobbledtogether Summer in the Southeast. No one does loinsasrock better than Oldham and he accordingly wrestles a set of quiet older tracks to the ground: \"O Let It Be\" and \"Three Questions\" are pugnacious, and Oldham has never presided over a moment as turgid as this band's teetering \"Master & Everyone\". Keyboardist Azita tenderly augments deep cut \"Weaker Soldier\" with barroom piano ambience. McCarthy shows for the Letting Go material, which sees its strings replaced with haughty electric keys and the burly electric guitar of Emmett Kelly.Then there's \"Magnificent Billy\", which is either a goof on \"Lay and Love\" or a live recording spliced with show banter: between harmonies Oldham and McCarthy alternate \"Just sayin' what's on my mind\" and \"Bonny Billy!…Bonny Billy!\" Right. Everyone is loose, everyone is happy in central coastal California, interjecting and harmonizing and remixing. Clear as mud. "}
