At least that's how it seems sometimes. After winning a Scribble Jam championship and releasing a series of incredible touronly CDs, he was given the dubious honor of being recognized as an \"Internet superstar.\" 2002 saw the release of his Personal Journals on Anticon's eponymous imprint, and while its emotional poignancy tapped a new vein in the hiphop canon, valuing vulnerability over machismo fa√ßades, its detractors were brutal in their dismissal of its lyrics and style. Now he's teamed up with longtime producer Joe Beats to develop Hope, and if the album isn't a direct response to anyone who ever dubbed him \"emo,\" it's proof he can play as hard in either arena.Hope shows a new Francis altogether, employing bouncy cadences, explosive deliveries and complex rhyme schemes. The vast majority of the album references older hiphop, including that of OC, Black Sheep, Beastie Boys, Audio Two, De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest, among others. He even drops his own crit with lines like \"faker than Raekwon's stutter\" and \"Das EFX rocked that bandaid ten years before Nelly did!\" His writing focuses on lighter subjects here, from his disdain for rambunctious children (\"Disasters\") to his views on commercial music (\"Mainstream 307\") to his eccentric nature regarding different facets of existence (\"Spaceman\"), which all makes for a solid record that, in terms of both diversity and delivery, puts Personal Journals to shame. The biggest testament to the looser nature of this album compared to his last is the inclusion of a fully developed song by his most popular alter ego. Riding a bassheavy doorknocker with a foreign vocal sample, \"Xaul Zan's Heart\" is one of Sage's funniest performances to date, as he plays the role of a misogynist pseudopimp that claims to be \"deeper than Sage Francis,\" \"the life of the search party,\" and a \"fairy godmotherfucker,\" closing the song with the rousing line, \"I am womanizer, hear me whore.\" If you've doubted Francis could be capable of diversifying, this track should change your mind. Of course, Sage is still fully capable of the emotional style he built his name on. Rapping over a swaying ambient track with lone trumpet salvos and subtle synths, \"The Cure\" closes the album with a tourdeforce, placing him in line as one of the best writers in hiphop today: \"You're not the travelling type?/ Then hide your baggage better,\" he tells a significant other, while the repetition of, \"When a boy writes off the world, it's done with sloppy, misspelled words/ If a girl writes off the world, it's done in cursive,\" stands as a powerful reminder to the inherent beauty of womankind. Paired with a sharp rhyme scheme (\"Now I look for air pockets to pick, walk with a stick/ Start picking locks with it, opening up heartshaped lockets with little arguments/ Tawdry trinkets start to split and contradict/ Those who say one thing but think the opposite\") and a ridiculously tight flow, it stands as one of the year's most delicately and intricately written songs. For a producer with such a low profile, Joe Beats makes an explosive splash in his first fulllength effort. His chemistry with Sage Francis is apparent throughout the album, as their interplay is something many producer/emcee teams could benefit from further exploring. Beats' use of beautifully raw drum programming hits like a more accessible Jel, and his mid90s sampling style hearkens back to Pete Rock and Prince Paul, or the lowend proficiency of a young Ali Shaheed Mohammed. From the floating, atmospheric keyboard of \"Spaceman\" to the triumphant hornled acoustic guitar crisscross \"Tolerance Level\", Joe Beats easily manages to bridge the gap between forward thinking and traditionalism. With Hope, Sage Francis and Joe Beats set out with an ambitious and impressive goal to create the ultimate 1994 record in 2003 and they've succeeded admirably, paying tribute to the past while updating it for the future. A highly valued reminder of the need for traditionalism in modern music, this album stands strong as one of the year's finest. "}
