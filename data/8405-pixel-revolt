{"label":" Barsuk","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/8268/homepage_large.7ed74d66.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"John Vanderslice","title":"Pixel Revolt","text":" Don't call it a concept, but on Pixel Revolt, there are four songs directly pertaining to September 11th and what followed. \"Plymouth Rock\" tells the story about a soldier's first and possibly last sortie in Iraq, with the swooning and swirling music an impartial backdrop to this scene. \"Exodus Damage\" talks about a militiaman seeing the second plane hit, the narrator resigned to a fate beyond his control as a Radioheadsanctioned mellotron chorus and various Middle Eastern drums circle around a repeated mocking call for \"dance dance revolution.\" \"Trance Manual\" has an embedded journalist in Afghanistan seeking solace in the arms of a prostitute, and features the delicate chiming of church bells. \"Radiant With Terror\" tweaks a Robert Lowell poem about Cold War fears (\"Fall 1961\") to address more clear and present dangers, and sets this paranoia to a tune that's a kissing cousin to Smashing Pumpkin's \"Disarm\". And then there are the other songs on the album. Songs about losing a girlfriend's rabbit, a detective tracking another detective in a murder investigation, a groupie infatuated with a pop star, and behaviormodifying pharmaceuticals. Superficially, there seems to be no connection between this crop of songs and the more politically aware ones. The boyfriend losing the rabbit and the wounded soldier seemingly have nothing in common, until the boyfriend of \"Angela\" uses the rabbit's escape as an excuse to talk about getting the hell out of Burbank \"What do we have here anyway?/ The abandoned warehouse scene.../ Synthesized, bullshit art dreams\". The detective in \"Continuation\" is caught in the same feedback loop as the gunshow goer in \"Exodus Damage\". And just as the journalist is looking to escape the noise and chaos of the war, the pop fan's looking for an oasis from the noise and chaos of his life. The verses of \"Peacocks in the Video Rain\" are cluttered with everyday debris and disjointed thoughts, but they give way to a simple fourword chorus, four words that are implied by the speaker in \"Trance Manual\" \"I love you, too.\" Like Vanderslice's last album, Pixel Revolt features a store's worth of cool noise makers, used primarily by the singer and longtime collaborator Scott Solter. Meticulous arrangements abound, with the strings done by cellist Erik Friedlander, but everything is in it's right place. To the credit of Vanderslice and Solter, the orchestral clowncar smorgasborgs to be had in \"Trance Manual\" and \"Exodus Damage\" sound just as unfussy as sparse tracks like \"Dead Pacific Slate\" and \"Farewell Transmission\". Some might wish this gift for fastidious arrangements would carry over to the lyrics, which feature a bevy of lookitup references and descriptions that might stymie attempts at easy listening. It doesn't hurt to do a little research or, like, pay attention to lyrics worth a damn. (According to the liner notes, \"the lyrics of Pixel Revolt have been edited, expanded, and otherwise improved upon by John Darnielle\", so now you know the rest of the story.) Appropriately, the one song that falls flat on this album \"CRC 7173, Affectionately\" is as straightforward as one could hope, both on the word and music tip. It's also boring as hell (think: really bad Maroon 5), and ends the album on a sour note. Better, in my mind, to end with the solemn epiphany of \"Dead Slate Pacific\" \"the only thing standing between/ Me and that long rope over a carpenter's beam/ Was you\" and its gorgeous instrumental coda, \"The Golden Gate\". On an excellent album full of stories about running away and seeking safe haven, it would have been nice to end knowing someone found where they belong and, hopefully, made it through to the other side.
