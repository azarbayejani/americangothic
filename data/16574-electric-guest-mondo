The buzzedabout L.A. band is pretty much a bulletproof combination of who you know and what you know lead singer Asa Taccone's brother Jorma is one of the songwriters in the Lonely Island, and they quickly caught the attention of the increasingly unstoppable Danger Mouse. But more important is that their sound perfectly anticipates a logical extension of the MGMT/Passion Pit/Foster the People trickledown effect, composed like corporate pop, produced like radio R&B, and given a synthandguitar power trio presentation that somehow lets it scan as \"indie rock.\" Add Danger Mouse and the fact that the slightly built, photogenic Taccone even dances a lot like Mark Foster, and how can this fail? Not surprisingly, their debut Mondo does turn out as something like a useful industry tool, but it's not so much a replicable schematic as it is a cautionary tale of what happens when a \"hit record\" forgets to actually include hits. Don't blame Danger Mouse, though his fingerprints are all over this thing, for better or worse.  Unfortunately, it's for worse at the outset, as opener \"Holes\" mismatches a wobbly synth progression with unctuous artificial string cheese, invoking his egregious ability to make things sound simultaneously democheap and overproduced. For the most part though, Mondo coasts on his M.O. to produce animated renderings of soul music something that's facially rootsbased, but decked out with enough Pro Tools tricks to avoid being the stuff of revivalists. \"This Head I Hold\" does recall the raveup R&B of Gnarls Barkley, and \"Awake\" does riff with enough bluesy grit to recall the Black Keys, and the vast majority of the tradindie second half of Mondo does do a passable Broken Bells.  Unfortunately for Electric Guest, this halo effect only highlights Taccone as Mondo's gaping hole. His phrasing and tendency to pinch falsetto instead of belt it out suggests some formative experiences singing into a hairbrush over Justin Timberlake records. But in execution, there's a personality void every bit as glaring that of a bland indie singer raised on Yo La Tengo, and he leaves no lyrical or melodic impression despite consistently being at the forefront. \"Under the Gun\" and \"Troubleman\" sit in a narrative no man's land, either B assignments for Jon Bon Jovi's MFA correspondence course or Lonely Island songs waiting for punchup. \"The Head I Hold\" burrows its way in out of sheer persistence, but it's Taccone's grating hitch of an \"ooh\" that serves as the hook as opposed to a fully hummable melody or a sticky lyric. \"Amber\" takes a similarly incantatory approach, its entire operation based on Taccone's distending the phonics of its title to the most annoying extent imaginable. Lord knows Danger Mouse gives Taccone all the help he can get adding sacramentwine gospel sweetener to the choruses of \"Awake\" and \"Waves\", and running Taccone's voice through just about every pencil mic, phonebox, and Strokeslike filter out there so as to make the reediness sound like a conscious production decision rather than a clear limitation. I was prepared to at least give it the credit of being \"workmanlike\" until the second half presumes Electric Guest's work is already done. Like most filler, it uses genre as a crutch. The doubletime rhythm of \"Waves\" has some kind of soulclap aspirations, but Taccone's vocals are meek and squeaky. If milquetoast indie bands ever get around to covering Frank Ocean's cover of Coldplay, it might turn out something like \"American Daydream\". If the mere title of \"Troubleman\" doesn't inspire enough eyerolling, just know the first lyric is, \"She was young once/ A girl of the bohemian kind,\" and after eightandahalf minutes of scattered acoustic strumming, it's finally over. This is clearly the handiwork of a band that figured merely showing up is 95% of the job. The problem with Mondo can be summed up by how it recognizes \"pop\" as a noun but not a verb there's no reason to believe that Electric Guest won't be playing strippeddown versions of \"This Head I Hold\" or \"American Daydream\" at the KROQ Acoustic Christmas, but neither of them leap out in a way that suggests they'd even come close to headlining either. Or maybe they will, who knows? But in the realm Electric Guest are trying to succeed in, you should know, and the actual songs of Mondo leave too much to uncertainty. No matter how many times you've heard \"Pumped Up Kicks\" or \"Sleepyhead\" or \"Kids\", it's stuck in your head whether or not it got your prior consent. You forget how most of Mondo goes even while it's playing. "}
