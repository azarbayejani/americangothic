It arguably peaked somewhere around 19851986: BDP's dancehallinflected crimestory classic \"9mm Goes Bang\" out of the South Bronx, Schoolly D's killer twofer \"P.S.K. What Does It Mean?\" / \"Gucci Time\" 12\" out of Philly, and IceT's prototypical West Coast gangsta anthem \"6 'N the Mornin'\" were all built on a sound that traded the old school's postdisco funk loop structure for something both rougheredged and more futuristic.Chief amongst the catalysts for this sound was Kurtis Mantronik, a JamaicanSyrianAmerican record store DJ who produced his debut single before he turned 20. His first major release, \"Needle to the Groove\", personifies our current idea of how drum machine hiphop sounds even if, upon its 1985 release, it sounded pretty damn out there compared to its peers. Mantronix: The Album has undergone a strangely accidental evolution to its status as a lost hiphop classic: Beloved by veteran heads yet considered incredibly dated in the sampleartisan Dre/RZA/Pete Rock/Primo 90s, it's since started sounding a lot more like a wellaging and prescient forebear of Southern bounce and hyphy.While the Deluxe Edition of The Album is an exhaustive 2xCD collection of remixes, extended versions, instrumentals, and a cappellas, the seven songs at the original album's core six originals and a slightly redundant but enjoyable \"MegaMix\" are the main draw. More specifically, it's Mantronik's production, which incorporates multiple layers of polyrhythmic boomclap percussion, aliensounding protoacid bass, and dubbedout scratching that sounds like King Tubby trying his hand at turntablism. Tracks like \"Hardcore HipHop\" and \"Needle to the Groove\" boast some of the most intricately assembled syncopated beats heard in any digital production to that point, and the mutated gogo of \"Ladies\" has a lot of carefully threaded gears turning beneath its instanthook bounce, claps and kicks throwing countermeasures against each other until they sound like a rhythmic swordfight. But it's \"Bassline\" that's probably the most famously innovative of these tracks: The titular low end turns electro's android jerkiness into a livebody strut, and the immaculate drum programming contains a busy but carefully refined volley of claps and snare hits that dart and weave in and out of each other spectacularly. It's this complexity and attention to detail that makes the production about as carefully humancrafted as any electronic music of the 80s, even as it focuses all that effort and energy squarely at the art of moving butts.As prescient as some of this stuff sounds, the vocal portion of this duo is more of his time MC Tee is as 1985 as they come, replete with singsong postLL flow, partypeoplecentric lyrics, and an instance of the word \"shit\" getting bleeped out. Those who don't mind how lyricism sounded before Rakim will find charm in Tee's voice, though for one thing, he acts as yet another finetuned component of Mantronik's rhythmic traffic, frequently adding an altered cadence and offbeat emphases in what would otherwise be a straightforward oldschool flow. (Plus it always helps to have a vocoder or a scratch answer back a few times.) Producer and MC complement each other enough that the instrumental tracks included on the extra disc seem incomplete, though as bonuses go having them is nice; throwing in a truckload of 12\", radio, and alternate edits (including the eventhicker club version of \"Bassline\") and a couple of solid live performances of \"Needle to the Groove\" and \"Ladies\" is even better.Mantronik would have a couple more years of hiphop greatness ahead of him: a few T La Rock singles made in the wake of his smash \"It's Yours\", including \"Back to Burn\" and \"This Beat Kicks\", became underrated classics, and JustIce's misleadingly named 1986 LP Back to the Old School boasted one of the alltime great mid80s hardcore breaks the monstrous \"Cold Gettin' Dumb\". On top of that, the second Mantronix LP, Music Madness, was a solid expansion of his signature sound. But by the late 80s he was arguably more revered by hardcore heads as an A&R than a producer, and his signing of EPMD to Sleeping Bag records ironically helped fuel a shift from midschool electrorap to the funkbreak revivalism of rap's Golden Age. His housefriendly 1998 remix of EPMD's classic \"Strictly Business\" is indication enough of where he went from there, further away from traditional hiphop and deeper into dance club territory, but don't take that as a warning. Mantronix: The Album sounds, in retrospect, more like the peak of classic rap innovation than a crossover compromise, and damn if it doesn't sound great played between Turf Talk and Mannie Fresh. "}
