{"label":" Sub Pop","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/12185/homepage_large.5edec339.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Oxford Collapse","title":"Bits","text":" Bits begins with an engine turning over, a car peeling off, and, a moment later, Brooklyn threepiece Oxford Collapse barreling along like an excited pup chasing after it. Throughout that hectic rush, opener \"Electric Arc\" finds its grounding in one of its few lyrics \"I can remember things/ I just don't know what to do.\" Guitarist/vocalist Michael Pace could just as easily be saying \"I can't remember things,\" and either way would work, as the two main ingredients in Oxford Collapse's songwriting are reminiscence and getting fucked up (see the title of their last record, Remember the Night Parties). But as much as Bits continues their exploration of postcollegiate drinking songs, they don't romanticize either aspect in the manner that Vampire Weekend or the Hold Steady do. Think more of the twentysomething working for the weekend, but giving up by Wednesday, enjoying postwork happy hours to the point where Thursday's sure to be a hassle. Or as the steinhoisting hook of \"Young Love Delivers\" goes, \"We're doing fine/ For our steady, slow decline.\"If this stasis has been explored thoroughly throughout the band's career, the concept of growing up has been less so, perhaps necessarily. The greatest pleasures on Remember the Night Parties were borne of amateurism think the the hilariously flubbed drum fill on \"Please Visit Your National Parks\" and \"Lady Lawyers\"'s complete ignorance of pitch while the pokey moments resulted from an experimentalism that felt a bit too forced (the middle of \"Loser City\", \"Return of the Burno\"). Nothing here hits with the immediacy of \"National Parks\", but consider it a blessing in disguise that song towered over its surroundings, whereas Bits is the sort of record where your favorite song could change weekly. For the first time, the band's neither over nor underproduced, and it results in a marked improvement that doesn't owe itself to a sea change of songwriting or sound. I wish there was a more exciting way to describe it than \"they're just better,\" but those who liked Remember the Night Parties and left wanting that vague sense of \"more\" are rewarded.Yes, this is hardworking indie with Sub Pop values, steeped in a continuum of 1980s college rock acts and 90s bands influenced by 80s college rock. Bits is streaked with irreverence, whether for C&W formality (the intuitively simple melodies of \"Featherbeds\" and \"Young Love Delivers\"), instrumental tightness (at times, they can make No Age sound like the Famous Flames) or lyrical artifice. Most likely students of Advanced Malkmus, the most resonant moments still feel injokey: \"My love came back from Sweden/ Brought me some bathroom reading,\" \"He got jacked up playing leapfrog/ And he was never quite the same.\" Even the record's most obvious sonic curveball (\"A Wedding\") is only that because it's based off the sawdust cellos that punctuated the more shadowy moments of There's Nothing Wrong With Love. As is, the string lines mirror Pace's subtly trancelike guitar parts, weaving in highregister licks while an open G or D drones beneath it.Or, more thumbnailstyle, perhaps a response to what doubters asked about Nouns what if you got rid of the static and the talking points? Lead single \"The Birthday Wars\" broils in distortion, initially feeling like it's following the minitrend of having Dave Fridmann redlevel your important followup. But it's not a slamdunk hook that sells the song; it's the way Pace keens \"whoa\" at the end of each line. That's evidence of how the band has become wiser about apportioning big moments rather than simply dumping them on you. Similarly, \"VernonJackson\" and \"I Hate Nobody\" both sound strangely plateau'ed the band gets incrementally louder throughout, suggesting a massive payoff that Oxford Collapse might have awkwardly delivered on in the past. Unfortunately, listeners too often get caught up in using a lack of coolness as a backhanded compliment, and even if there is a return to a DIY aesthetic with OC (along with Times New Viking, Wye Oak, No Age), it's still disarming. Oxford Collapse tend to be big on dedications and inclusiveness see the lovey hook on \"For the Winter Coats\".  I hope it doesn't sell Bits short likening it to indie comfort food, but as \"I Hate Nobody\" and the pocketArcade Fire shoutalong \"Children's Crusade\" mash fist pumps and group hugs into the same motion, it hardly matters that Oxford Collapse seem more content soundtracking your favorite moments than becoming your favorite band.
