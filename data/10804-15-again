{"label":" Astralwerks","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/10604/homepage_large.1de92b3b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Cassius","title":"15 Again","text":" A little personal nostalgia can be a good way for musicians to reconnect with their artistic inspiration just listen to Daft Punk's Discovery, a record largely spurred by the feelings the duo got from hearing pop music as children, or the Who coming to terms with their mod youth on Quadrophenia. It so often happens that these trips down memory lane somehow wind up being remarkably in tune with whatever retropop movements might be happening at the time, so it might not be too obvious that this kind of motivation is what drives 15 Again, the first album in four years from dance music vets Cassius (five if you account for the oneyear gap it took to cross the Atlantic). After all, it's a French housepop album that draws significantly from the funk, electro, postpunk, synthpop and techno movements that stretched across the span of the 80s that's only something you don't hear every day if you avoid anything remotely resembling current dance music. But here's where 15 Again gets tricky: I couldn't find any specific details as to how old Philippe \"Zdar\" Cerboneschi or Hubert \"Boom Bass\" BlancFrancard actually are. This means that figuring out the exact period of the album's impressionable midteen years is a bit elusive, and that's where we get back to that whole spanofthe80s thing; any record that starts with a goodbyeseventies Italodisco/new wave jam (\"Toop Toop\") and crests at the end with a foursong block of Phuture/Derrick May/Orbitalstyle rave fodder is, if maybe unintentionally, just as effective as a roadmap of dance music's decadelong mutation as it is a \"man music was amazing when we were young\" look in the rearview. Maybe more so, since a purer form of nostalgia would do a lot less to disguise or modernize the catalysts that pushed the members of Cassius towards becoming pop musicians. It's easy enough to halfhear the first couple bars of a track on this album and notice the echoes of Paisley Park and the Hacienda, but it's just as easy to streamline this into the present. The acidhousetinged title track isn't too far off from the kind of rave'n'B that's growing to define the late zero years, only with the breathy, subdued intensity of Gladys Gambie in place of Rihanna. Gambie also sings lead on \"Rock Number One\", where its Princely electrosoul lushness helps push her voice into an understated version of Chaka Khan, but the production is so spotlessly moderndigital that it sounds as much like 3121 as 1999. And while \"This Song\" might split a snarling, bassheavy, handclapriddled difference between Blondie's \"Call Me\" and Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\", it also elicits pangs of a somewhat more baffled and recent nostalgia hey, remember schaffel?  Interestingly, the further it gets towards the end of the 80s and the core of techno, the less it tries to connect with contemporary pop; \"15 Again\" aside, the acid house and Detroit techno homages (\"Jack Rock\"; \"Cactus\"; \"Shame Shame Cherie\") are pretty straightforward enough to sound like they came from an album without Pharrell Williams on it. (In this case, that'd be a better album Pharrell's awkward environmentalapocalypse crooning on \"Eye Water\" is a low point, and as a remake of 2002's Au Rêve opening cut \"Hi Water\", a redundant one at that.) But some peoples’ midteens are more confusing and more burdened with identity crises than others, and that could be enough to forgive this album’s thematic inconsistency: Cassius aren’t just capturing their own youth, they’re reveling in the youthful days of an entire sound on a record that a 15yearold could enjoy.
