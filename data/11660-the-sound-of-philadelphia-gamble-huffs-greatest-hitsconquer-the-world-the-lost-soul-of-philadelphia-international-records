Much like Motown in the 1960s declaring itself \"The Sound of Young America\", Philadelphia International aimed to conquer the world with a specific, auteurdriven sound steeped in the roots of one major American metropolis and the auteurs in question were Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, who stood as the primary architects of the 1970s' upwardlymobile orchestral version of soul. Their productions' opulence, smoothness, and chops abetted by MFSB, one of the great studio bands in music history paved the way for disco, sparked inspiration in Elton John and David Bowie, and acted as the soulful but crossoverfriendly counterpart to the decade's wildassed, postSly Stone funk much in the same way Berry Gordy's meticulous empire offset the grittiness of Stax and Atlantic. MFSB's \"T.S.O.P. (The Sound of Philadelphia)\" had only one line, \"people all over the world\" an echo of the underlying sentiment from one of the label's big early smashes, the O'Jays' \"Love Train\", but also a clear statement of who, exactly, they were aiming their music towards.The Sound of Philadelphia: Gamble & Huff's Greatest Hits is a not entirely thorough yet almost unfailingly great crosssection of singles focusing largely on the label's peak years in the earlymid 70s. Just about everything you need to know about the Gamble and Huff approach is covered in the comp's first two songs, both from the O'Jays' 1972 breakthrough LP Back Stabbers the optimistic idyll of globalpeace dance number \"Love Train\", and the more cynical (and pragmatic) duplicity warnings of \"Back Stabbers\". They both feature the songwriting and production team's greatest strengths a simple, economic usage of lyricism that worked in both a rhythmic and melodic sense (listen to the way the chorus to \"Back Stabbers\" unfurls from the slow, sinister glide of \"they smiiiiiile in your face\" to the rapidfire fingerjabs of \"all the time they wannatakeyourplace\"), backed with a fine balance of punchy, outfront grooves and almost delicate orchestral ornamentation. All that, with the vocal interplay of lead singer Eddie Levert and backups Walter Williams and William Powell well, it's nothing short of worldbeating. The rest of the compilation is filled with songs that hit the top five on both the r&b and pop charts Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' elegiac, gorgeous \"If You Don't Know Me By Now\" (a careermaking performance from the young singer Teddy Pendergrass); Billy Paul's sly yet guiltwracked infidelity ballad \"Me and Mrs. Jones\"; the Three Degrees' \"When Will I See You Again\", which made longing sound strangely peppy. It's telling that seven of the compilation's 14 tracks fall in a twoyear span, and once it gets past 19721973 things get even more lush and orchestrated, until it flirts with adult contemporary sounds. But given the singers the velvety rumble of Lou Rawls in \"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\", or the oldschool streetcorner doowop flourishes of the Intruders' \"I'll Always Love My Mama\" there's a sense that this sound of middleclass luxury was hardachieved from the ground floor up. Throw in a couple lateperiod ballads by Pendergrass (\"Close the Door\") and Patti Labelle (\"If Only You Knew\", the only post70s track in the collection) and McFadden & Whitehead's \"Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now\" disco's greatest moment of populist hubris and it's clear that Philadelphia International's peak didn't taper off much. Like many Greatest Hits albums, especially labelcentered ones, The Sound of Philadelphia does have that everpresent Catch22 the only real weakness in the songs included here is an overwhelming (if comforting) familiarity, but it's also easy to wonder why some equally familiar songs were left out; there's plenty other places to hear the O'Jays' \"For the Love of Money\", but why not here, too? At least the gaps don't cut out too much context or history; it's a shame we don't get to hear Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes' rapturous lament \"Bad Luck\" or the euphoria of MFSB's disco blueprint \"Love Is the Message\" (dubbed by some discophiles and Bboys, in a bit of scenetraversing appropriation, as \"Brooklyn's National Anthem\"), but their absence doesn't alter the collection's disposition much. There's one regrettably missing track that could've underlined one of Philadelphia International's strongest characteristics 1977's \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\", an allstar neighborhoodrevival benefit record featuring Rawls, Pendergrass, Paul, the O'Jays, & Dee Dee Sharp, was one of the label's many endeavors set up to give back to their city but the rest of the label's unique character is intact.  Or at least the unique character that the Top 40 listener knew. Conquer the World: The Lost Soul of Philadelphia International Records is a counterpart to Gamble & Huff's Greatest Hits Philadelphia without the international, a locally focused collection of bands and singers who could lay claim to contributing to the sound of Philadelphia while frequently sounding little like their charttopping labelmates from the very same area code. Despite the presence of seven songs cowritten by either Gamble or Huff (five involving both), their imprint isn't as obvious here, and some of the songs they did write aren't so easily identifiable as such. People's Choice also represented on The Sound of Philadelphia by the elastic discofunk of \"Do It Any Way You Wanna\" deliver some bluesy, fullthroated Southernstyle soul belting on the Huffpenned \"The Big Hurt\", Ruth McFadden's \"Ghetto Woman (Parts 1 & 2)\" features a brassy, fuzzguitardrenched arrangement that sounds calculated to oneup every \"Theme from Shaft\"geeked coattail rider on the r&b charts, and David \"Bunny\" Sigler & Dee Dee Sharp's \"Conquer the World Together\" is a great recapturing of the chemistry that Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell sparked in the studio together.  In fact, it's Sigler who makes his presence known in Conquer the World's most memorable and eccentric moments. As one of Gamble and Huff's longest and closest collaborators, Sigler proved himself to be a versatile lyricist and arranger, not to mention a helluva performer. Aside from \"Conquer the World Together\", he also delivers on \"Everybody Needs Good Lovin' (Parts 1 & 2)\", a fiery 1971 single that almost comes across like an answer to Wilson Pickett's 1970 Phillyrecorded, Gamble & Huffpenned hit \"Get Me Back on Time, Engine Number 9\". And Bunny winds up beating Carl Douglas and his trail of kungfualikes to the oneinch punch by a good year or so with 1973's \"Theme for Five Fingers of Death\", an unofficial title song to the Shaw Brothers classic, punctuated by twangy guitar and percussive backhand slaps and a ton of martial arts pontificating (\"I've given you my secret technique for the Iron Fist. Always use it in the cause of justice. Never use it for personal glory\"). It's a far cry from getting on board the Love Train. "}
