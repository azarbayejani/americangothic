{"label":" Kill Rock Stars","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/1902/homepage_large.12b31db1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By William Bowers","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Fields and Streams","text":" I can't find any scoop on what the organizing principle of this mammoth comp is supposed to be, or why it has the naturey name, or what the pic of the leaping deer overlaid with yellow blobs means. Is this just a giddy showcase for showcasing's sake, in the spirit of Kill Rock Stars' classic samplers? Do these two discs and 45 songs honor some occasion or aid some cause to which I am tragically not hip? The bands come from a zillion places, and zillion labels some are even unsigned. The sounds range from daring to dated, the singers from grand to pukeinducing. Uh, there's a woman in almost every band? The only way I could cope with and encapsulate for you the high and lowlights on this mystery of plentifulness is if I seek the clarity provided by that art of succinct mystery: haiku.
