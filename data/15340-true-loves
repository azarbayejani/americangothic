Though they've staked out in different territories in terms of both production and influence, both headliners embody an ideal of what indie rock meant in the 1990s. Pains and Surfer Blood are heavy on the guitars, with songs written and recorded by four or five people in a room, each of whom has an easily identifiable job essentially a scrappier version of the \"alternative rock\" on the radio back in the day. Meanwhile, Hooray For Earth are what people are thinking of right now: songs composed on synthesizers that take cues from dance and psychedelia, fluidity between the roles of the players. But all in all, game recognized game, for on True Loves, Hooray For Earth also display a precocious knack for massive, majorkey hooks that are \"indie rock\" in name only. As you could probably guess from the preceding description, advance singles \"True Loves\" and \"Sails\" placed the New York quartet in the packed house of bands often tagged with \"what we wished Congratulations sounded like.\" It's unfair on both counts, robbing MGMT of some sort of agency in their artistic trajectory and limiting Hooray For Earth in terms of scope. With its candycoated vocals and fluorescent production, True Loves siphons color from all points on the synthpop spectrum. The spiky arpeggios of \"Realize It's Not the Sun\" and \"Sails\" pay homage to the Knife as well as Depeche Mode's arenaready 90s, but each employs them for divergent purposes. And the title track offers upstroked, skarhythm guitars and Noel Heroux's dexterous falsetto run, along with dublike painting around the edges with eerie, desiccated sound effects. Though sounding more like a singles collection than a coherent albumlength vision, True Loves seems to unfold in a way that shows Hooray For Earth steadily accruing melodic confidence. While the six minutes of electrotribal mantras on closer \"Black Trees\" recall earlier Yeasayer, the nervy palmmuted guitars and bold synthhorn charts of \"No Love\" and \"Bring Us Closer Together\" easily top Odd Blood's attempts at Trevor Hornstyled 80s chartbusters. But the sequencing isn't perfect: In between the killer bookends, serviceable midalbum palate cleansers \"Same\" and \"Hotel\" form a 10minute stretch that roams a bit too far off course before the big reveals. The lull in momentum is more pronounced since the lyrics can be simultaneously too plainspoken and standoffish: As extroverted as these songs sound, you really never get a full sense of Hooray For Earth's personality. Still, it's no slight to say they've allowed themselves room for growth after True Loves, and there's little reason to believe their name won't be at the top of the marquee on the next goround. "}
