{"label":" Def Jam","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/14621/homepage_large.d844748a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tim Finney","artist":"Electrik Red","title":"How To Be A Lady, Volume 1","text":" \"I'm not a freak, I'm not a nasty ho... well I'm lying, but I'm classy though,\" Electrik Red member Binkie extemporizes on \"Muah\", the opener to the R&B group's debut album, How to Be a Lady, Volume 1. It's not the first evidence that the album's title is very much tongue in cheek. For Electrik Red, class is a nebulous quality, synonymous with an amorphous girl power cobbled together from the last decade of hiphop and R&B femme fatales (Beyonc√©, Lil' Kim, Kelis, Ciara). Accordingly, Electrik Red see no contradiction between slavedriving dominance (\"W.F.Y.\") and slavish submission (\"Bed Rest\"), modern female independence (\"Friend Lover\") and its easy loss (\"So Good\"), mercantile sexual consumerism (\"P Is for Power\") and incommensurate sexual generosity (\"Devotion\").If that sounds like a criticism, it's not meant to be: Electrik Red understand that we don't know what we want even when we sound like we do; if they seem to conflate love and sex a little too freely, well, life's like that when the going's good. It's not a concept album, but if How to Be a Lady has a central concept, it's that of the fling, the romantic rendezvous that starts off as something fun and ends up much more intense and involved. And the music feels like a fling, too, its easy comforts concealing more mysterious, urgent impulses. Mostly written and produced by R&B singer TheDream and his inhouse production team (C. \"Tricky\" Stewart, L.O.S. Da Mystro), the album features that same penchant for intoxicatingly lush, swirly slow jams and rococo, informationoverload uptempo tracks that characterize TheDream's own work, not to mention lyrics that alternate between perfect, ridiculous, and perfectly ridiculous (\"Tonight's the night, so baby order/ Now I'm biting on your body like an hors doeurve\").Undeniably, Electrik Red are contemporary R&B formula: four harmonizing and occasionally rapping vocalists covering the spectrum from breathy innocence to sly rasp; overripe synthetic productions drunk on 1980s Prince, R Kelly, and Polow Da Don; a near total obliviousness to matters outside of sex and dancing and their attendant concerns. Their confidence is the confidence of an entire genre, detached from the hallmarks of individualism that traditionally attract plaudits, such that it doesn't really matter whether it's Lesley or Naomi who takes time out from \"W.F.Y.\" to compliment you on that thing that you do with your tongue (\"Amazing. Stupendous. Marvelous. Exciting.\") but then criticize you for wearing skinny jeans.How to Be a Lady is filled with gratuitous little surprises: the absurd and brilliant codoperatic backing vocals in the rococo chorus of \"Freaky Freaky\"; the commanding dance instructions (\"Cup, sip, yep... yurrr/ Two step, stop... yurrr\") that interrupt the icy club banger \"Drink in My Cup\"; the sudden shard of inadvertent melancholy that invades the breezy \"Friend Lover\" as Naomi tells her friend with benefits, \"You can't stay past five/ I gotta be at work by nine!\" Such moments make Electrik Red's music feel as real and livedin as dazzling, shiny R&B can hope to, possessing a capacity for rightness that cannot be reduced to lyrical sophistication, performative flair, or production novelty, but is borne of the kind of charisma you can possess when you take success for granted. And because Electrik Red take it for granted, it's tempting to adopt the same stance as listener; but these songs have already outsmarted you. As \"So Good\" puts it, \"I shouldn't have let you hit that/ 'Cause now I can't forget that.\" "}
