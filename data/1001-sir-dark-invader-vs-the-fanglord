Deusner","artist":"Richard Buckner & Jon Langford","title":"Sir Dark Invader vs. the Fanglord","text":" In one corner you have Richard Buckner, aka Sir Dark Invader, the Devotion + Doubt Demolisher, the AltCountry Annihilator. And in the opposing corner is Jon Langford, aka the Fanglord, aka the Mekons Menace, the Waco Brothers Brawler. It's a match made not in heaven, but in Sally Timms's Chicago apartment, where in 2002 Buckner and Langford recorded eight of the nine songs on this oneoff collaboration album, released on Langford's Buried Treasure Records. The title suggests there may have been some friendly competition involved, which seems almost inevitable given their distinct styles. Sir Dark Invader vs. the Fanglord pits Buckner's melting drawl against Langford's grainy vocals; Buckner's abstracted, introspective songwriting against Langford's demonstrative, outwardlooking lyrics; Buckner's ragged beard against Langford's trimmed mustache.  This amiable musical friction enlivens every song: pounding drums and punchy basslines jab at welterweight guitar melodies, and over the melee, Buckner and Langford move easily between lead and backing vocals and trade off instruments and solos almost on a whim. As a result, songs like the opener \"The Rolling of the Eyes\" and \"The Inca Princess\" generate brawling momentum the kind seldom associated with Buckner's solo material while tracks like \"Nothing to Show\" and the closer \"Do You Wanna Go Somewhere?\" sound battered and worn, but not necessarily defeated. The album is a volley of contradictions, a tossedoff collaboration (shelved for almost three years) that never sounds haphazard. The lighthearted aspects of the project songs like \"The Inca Princess\", the comicbook aliases, the photobooth snapshots of both men that decorate the pixilated packaging disguise the gravity of the songs. \"Nothing to show for the things that I've done,\" Langford sings on the ruminative \"Nothing to Show\", \"There were places to go, and I had to choose this one.\" Buckner takes over for the second verse, expressing an equally worldweary remorse. If they're pugilists on other songs, here they sound like hardtimers: singing \"We'll be lucky to leave/ Lucky to leave with our lives\", they sound like they're holding each other up, two drunks stumbling home from another long night at the bar.  This feeling bridges the twominute intermission, \"From Attic to Basement\", and continues on the standout \"Torn Apart\" and the raucous \"Inca Princess\". The former's tense rhythms echo the restlessness of its lyrics, as Buckner and Langfird share a rueful backandforth, singing the title over and over as the song winds down. \"The Inca Princess\" kicks up a barnstorming momentum as Langford describes a bar so tough that \"drinkin' and drivin' was almost mandat'ry.\" By contrast, the conflicted lullaby \"No Tears Tonight\" and the abruptly abandoned \"Do You Wanna Go Somewhere?\" parse the isolation and the inspiration of a life devoted to music. \"I wanna wrap you up in music,\" Langford sings, then admits, \"But we both know that I got nothing/ Spent too much time playing in bands.\" Taken together, these two tracks comprise a twist ending of sorts, revealing that Sir Dark Invader and the Fanglord have been fighting on the same side all along, battling the spectre of loneliness. The mix of celebration and commiseration on the album suggests a draw. "}
