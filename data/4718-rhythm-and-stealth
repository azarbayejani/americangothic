{"label":" Columbia / Higher Ground / Hard Hands","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/4661/homepage_large.7216c8c4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Paul Cooper","artist":"Leftfield","title":"Rhythm and Stealth","text":" Leftfield are surely dance music's most reluctant victims. Paul Daley and Neil Barnes aren't the sort of losers who hang out in church halls waiting for the other members of their selfesteem classmates to arrive. Leftfield don't sup on weak tea and selfpity. Just because they don't sport bifocals patched together with duct tape, it doesn't mean we can't point our fingers at them and mutter, \"You could have been the best we ever thought there could be.\" See, under a more favorable constellation, Leftfield would illuminated the firmament. For a pair who knocked around with A Man Called Adam and the Brand New Heavies, they showed initiative. They turned their backs on their mediocre beginnings, established their own Hard Hands label, and released underground dub house disco tunes (\"Release the Pressure\" and \"Open Up\") that still cause floors to burn. That John Lydon \"graced\" Leftfield's incendiary \"Open Up\" with his sneering, snarling pitbull lines is proof of how important Barnes and Daley were perceived to be. When Leftfield's debut album, Leftism, finally dropped, few could honestly say it was worth the wait. After dubbing David Bowie worthy of consideration (they remixed Bowie's \"Jump They Say\") and having given William Orbit's Guerilla Records a perennial bomb with their Dubfield mix of React 2 Rhythm's \"Intoxication,\" Leftism seemed scrawny in comparison. Had \"Open Up\" and \"Release the Pressure\" not been included in its track listing, it seems unlikely that anyone would be talking about Leftfield nowadays. However, fate (or at least Sony's marketing department) had implemented a longterm strategy to establish Leftfield as the faces of techno. Barnes and Daley would be the Lennon and McCartney of the new rock and roll. But the plan failed for two reasons: (1) Underworld, and; (2) Barnes and Daley didn't pull out an album every year. It took them four years to follow up on their debut, and in that time, Underworld and others had run off with all the major prizes.Rhythm and Stealth is the quintessential \"difficult sophomore\" album. Leftfield definitely want us to recall Leftism, but they also point a defining finger into the future. Unfortunately for them (and us), artists such as Arovane, Freeform, Richard Harvey, Richie Hawtin, and Boards of Canada, to prattle off just a few, have eclipsed the duo. But the Leftfield moniker still has some currency and draw; Afrika Bambaataa gets grizzly on the electrobass of \"Afrika Shox\" (used, predictably, in a UK television ad); Roots Manuva, the man who will save British rap, rasps and rhymes deadly on \"Dusted.\" But these two memorable tracks are weighed down by ambient drool like \"El Cid\" and the watery gruel Leftfield ladle out under the title of \"Chant of a Poor Man.\" And why bother with the spitball album version of \"Phat Planet\" when you can have the armorpiercing remix by Dave Clarke?Rhythm and Stealth is a case of too little too late. We're clamoring for an album that these guys can't deliver. In our overblown hopes for the salvation of rock, we chose the wrong candidates to deliver the debauchery, the rioting, and the risk that made listening to rock radio such a dirty illicit thrill. The starkly saddening thought is that there may not be anyone out there capable of making us wet ourselves with excitement. We may all be victims of overwhelming disappointment. "}
