Their DayGlo party had been going on for hours and the night was still youngish, their pupils weren't quite the appropriate size, and everything sounded like a really awesome idea. Since then, Urdur \"Earth\" Hákonadóttir, the singer whose robust wail was all over the last couple of GusGus albums, has left the band, they've hooked up with the Cologne minimal techno label Kompakt, and Iceland has gone into a financial tailspin that makes the U.S. economy look positively hearty by comparison. GusGus's seventh album isn't quite a hangover, and there's still a party going on but the party is somewhere far away.Sometimes that's literal: the bass thump that underscores these six songs sounds like it's echoing across an expanse of frozen desert. 24/7 is unmistakably a dance record, but it's about the most ascetic, burnedout, pissedoff electronic dance record anyone's made since Depeche Mode's \"Fly on the Windscreen\". (GusGus borrows a lot of mid80s Depeche Mode's synth tones here, actually.) Its lyrical themes are exile, bitterness, overwork, and the emptiness of sex, and almost all of its beats are muted and clipped, as if the group's longtime core of Biggi Veira and President Bongo are reserving their machine's full strength in case they need it later. The album's title comes from \"On the Job\", which follows two verses of workethic boasting with a deliberately insipid singsong comeon (\"I wanna make you happy 'cause I like you a lot...\") in its context, it sounds like a weary prostitute's pitch.Dance music's usual strategy for dealing with hard economic times is pointed irony, and the claim that dancing is some kind of refuge from the bad stuff: think of Donna Summer's \"She Works Hard for the Money\" or Chic's \"Good Times\". GusGus, on the other hand, are just sarcastic and indignant. \"If you can't tolerate my kind you can kiss my fucking ass,\" Daniel Ágúst Haraldsson spits on \"Hateful\"; when he croons \"I feel like dancing\" on the opening track, it's only so he can follow it up with the punch line \"...on the thinnest ice.\" (Then the disco backing singers show up to repeat \"feel like dancin'\" a million times, their voices reduced to hollow ricochets between the speakers.) The only hint of hedonism comes on Jimi Tenor's brief guest appearance, \"Take Me Baby\", and even his sexedup muttering is run through a filter that makes it sound mushmouthed and creepy.24/7 is full of huge, open spaces with just a few instruments streaking across them the sort of passages that trance producers and DJs tend to use for the sake of pacing and contrast. Here, though, they're the whole story. The album's sole instrumental, \"Bremen Cowboy\", is all breakdown and buildup; it keeps clearing the ground for the big beat and the big hook to come in, but they never do. And its closing 11minute epic, \"Add This Song\", cannibalizes itself into nonexistence. The part Haraldsson sings is a desperate pitch for itself (to be added like an item on a DJ's playlist? like a vague acquaintance on Facebook?), and the rest of the song is fidgeting, flickering synths snipping at each other like they're running out of power. Dancing won't actually save your life when everything crashes, GusGus suggests. It might not even give you pleasure. But what else are you going to do? "}
