Sylvester","artist":"Manitoba","title":"Hendrix with Ko EP","text":" Perhaps it's because it was the first of the album's songs I heard, but \"Hendrix with Ko\" was for me the standout track of Manitoba's Up in Flames. Besides its layer upon layer of warm, gushing sound, it also held claim to the album's most grandiose beat, featured the delicate croon of Koushik Ghosh (who puts the \"Ko\" in this song's title), and boasted a fittingly high number of bahbahsbah's and handclaps. But \"Hendrix with Ko\" had something deeper to it: though its surface was purely beautiful, its intricate structures and nuances encapsulated Dan Snaith's effort with the album itself particularly in light of his earlier IDM work. This song, more than any other on Up in Flames, preserved Manitoba's mild penchant for the fourtothefloor electronic pulse that surfaced on Start Breaking My Heart (in such tracks as \"Mammals Vs. Reptiles\" and \"Tits and Ass: The Great Canadian Weekend\"), without sacrificing his giant new psychpop sound. \"Hendrix with Ko\" seemed to be the truest to Snaith's role as IDM pastor: though it maintained a highly analog feel like the others on Up in Flames, its proclivity to beat seemed more informed by his previous electronic ethos. If \"the beat is the thing\" in \"Hendrix with Ko\", then it makes some kind of sense that Snaith includes with this EP two very beatoriented, if very unUp in Flames, Bsides. Unlike in the Jacknuggeted EP, whose bonus cuts seemed to share the same psychedelic tenor of its title track, it's hard to believe that \"Cherrybomb\" and \"Silver Splinters\" were even culled from the same studio sessions. The two tracks, as if stuck in the noman'sland of the Snaith catalog, seem to function more or less as a missing link between Manitoba's two dissimilar releases: each presents common ground in Snaith's beathappiness and his oftdramatic vertical composition. \"Cherrybomb\" immediately cuts to a simple driving pulse, painted in the subtle pinks and blues of the Boards of Canada sound palette. An alarm clock rings on occasion, and the bell and organ sounds that we would hear throughout Up in Flames provide a deeper texture. \"Silver Splinters\", meanwhile, sports a big beat reminiscent of Gus Gus' Polydistortion, wavering in atmospheric intensity, replete with flute, handclaps, and even a Prefusestyle vocal scratchup. A trumpet pushes the song into its next section when it flips its octave a la jazz standard \"Gingerbread Man\", all while a simple IDM lullaby persists amidst the madness. The Hendrix with Ko EP also includes, curiously, the \"Jacknuggeted\" video. Why this didn't have its place on that song's EP can probably be chalked up to a matter of timing (i.e. it may not have been completed when that single was released). It's a treat nonetheless, serving up a trippy frolic in the woods that perfectly complements the song. Revealing Manitoba Bsides and Quicktime movies hardly appeal to more than an already convinced contingent of Snaith worshippers, but if you count yourself among them (and you ought to), this is well worth picking up.
