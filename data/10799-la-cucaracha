Over the past 17 years, Ween have become the opposite of what today's indie rock fans seem to demand: They're a band prone to subverting genre familiarity, mocking selfseriousness, and singing songs about fun things like sex and drugs. Their followers have only increased with each release, coming to the band through their Twin/Tone debut God Ween Satan: The Oneness, \"Push th' Little Daisies\" on Beavis & Butthead, their receipt of the noted \"Cute Band Alert\" in Sassy Magazine, the Spike Jonzedirected Buzz Clipâ„¢ for \"Freedom of '76\", Phish covering \"Roses are Free\", their appearances on Crank Yankers and South Park, their notoriously badass live sets, \"Ocean Man\" in the Honda ad, that time they did \"Exactly Where I'm At\" on Letterman, the stillhilarious Pizza Hut jingle debacle, and dozens of points in between. When put into perspective, Ween's career to date encompasses maybe every possible way for a band to gain notice that's emerged in the last 20 years. And to think that now all they'd need is a 96k mp3 on a Myspace page. Bah. Ween might have built their following in a preMySpace age, but \"Friends\", from their ninth LP La Cucaracha, certainly seems like an ode to the simple, repetitive joy of clicking toward companionship. They don't stop with social networking: La Cucaracha is Ween's first album since they canceled a leg of their fall 2004 tour due to \"health concerns,\" a turn of events resulting in the word \"rehab\" being bandied around. The band is rightfully protective of its privacy, but the overriding sentiment of the new album seems to be a New Agey approach to getting in touch with one's \"inner\" self, and reconnecting with society at large. Of course, this is Ween we're talking about, so there are songs like \"Shamemaker\", the result of a counseling session about confronting your enemies, and \"Learnin' to Love\", dayatatime lifemanagement in the geeky hillbilly style that didn't quite gel on 1996's 12 Golden Country Greats. \"Spirit Walker\" is WeenonaPure Moodscompilation, with vocoder creating a pastel fog of spectral irony. It's a hilarious sendup, and one of the more successful tracks on the record. The pianobased \"Lullaby\" is among their sweetest songs, but its preternatural calmness and focus on \"sleeping like a baby\" feels like a childhood regression more than anything else. There are a couple of moments on La Cucaracha that can stand up with some of the band's best work; it's too bad they're not more frequent. The album opens after the tossedoff \"Fiesta\" with \"Blue Balloon\", whose hazy, tweaked backdrop of drum machines, chiming guitars, and nasal synths sounds like a relapse into the Dristan cocktail decadence of their first three albums. \"Woman and Man\" is the best example of the duo's new fondness for breaking nature down to its core components: Starting as a primitivist Adam and Eve tale (complete with bongo and flute), the song erupts into a soaring excuse for interlocking guitar solos. Ween's ode to the dawn of the sexes is followed by a heartily tongueincheek example of how far they've evolved. \"Your Party\" brilliantly parodies \"yacht rock\"'s smarmy, WASPy decadence, its narrator speaking for \"the wife\" when thanking last night's host for \"candy and spices, and tricolored pastas.\" And yes, Ween scored the ultraappropriate David Sanborn to lay down the syrupy sax line.  Because of its direct debt to recognizable forms, Ween's musical output has succeeded and failed largely based on the quality of the original material. The band's creative and commercial plateau from Chocolate & Cheese through The Mollusk and White Pepper showed that, when they chose wisely, they could interpret and trick out seemingly any musical form (even the dud 12 Golden Country Greats wasn't lacking for effort). But on La Cucaracha, possibly out of a debt to realism, the duo has mostly chosen material founded on notions of placidity (or, in the case of \"Friends\", erased much of the original color), purposefully disallowing their own music its previous vitality.
