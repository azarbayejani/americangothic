They seem to imply that hiphop and dance music are naturally unintelligent styles, and a special provision has to be made to distinguish the select few exceptions that break the mold of stupidity. And that's not even getting into the vaguely racist connotations the phrase brings with it: you don't hear people talking about \"intelligent indie rock\" as a genre separate from plain ol' indie rock. I just wanted to wipe the slate clean before applying the phrase to Mike Ladd, possibly the brainiest of the latest wave of Ivy League rap. There's a widely circulating story that Ladd went to Harvard. He didn't he was just born in Cambridge, Massachusetts but it's revealing that the story is so widely accepted. as gospel. He sounds like he went there. Not that Ladd's rhymes possess some kind of mindtwisting complexity, but everything he has his hand in radiates thoughtfulness and craft. Ladd discovered hiphop, punk, and poetry at roughly the same time as a kid, so he's equally comfortable discussing, or rapping about, Parliament, J. Mascis and Langston Hughes. He began his career as a spoken word artist in New York, and his words still push the envelope conceptually, but somewhere along the line, he learned how to create amazingly textured and funky musical backdrops to accompany his words. And actually, they're more than just backdrops on Vernacular Homocide. On this sevensong EP, containing half previously released bsides and half new tracks, Ladd's instrumental sketches threaten to upstage his verbal throwdowns. \"Poseidon's Reigns,\" for instance, has Ladd welding a raggedass drum machine to soaring, Fripplike guitar sear like something from Bowie's Berlin trilogy. Then there's \"Music for Tanks,\" sounding like the soundtrack to a Tarkovsky scifi flick set in the Caribbean. Both songs are clear highlights you take with you long after the words have faded from memory. Of the tracks which offer a taste of Ladd's lyrical skills, the best of the batch is the opening track, \"Foxwoods,\" a smoothly flowing antidote to the \"noflowfo'hoes\" brand of hiphop. \"Payback's a bitch,\" Ladd sings, \"even in small increments.\" Elsewhere, \"The Last Word\" is a spacedout soul shoutout where Ladd raves (seemingly sarcastically), \"Nobody makes money like Mike Ladd makes money,\" with operatic backup singers spurring him on. \"Northampton\" is a Mad Libstyle, spedup rant that sounds like a fiveyearold singing James Brown, and it sits in sharp contrast to the final track: a sober, unaccompanied poem about Ladd's mother, or more specifically, about her age. \"If I tell my mother's age, I'll never be forgiven,\" Ladd speaks slowly and deliberately. \"St. Peter will look at me with those horrible, cascading eyes like a woman from the ice storm.\"Vernacular Homocide is a quick and powerful dose of what makes Mike Ladd someone to keep an eye one: great lyrics that never try to be witty (they simply are) and rarely reveal themselves immediately, and an amazing stylistic breadth, from semicomedic rap to what you could call singer/songwriter hiphop. His two fulllengths are also great, but can be a bit overwhelming. This disc might be a better place for the uninitiated to sample Ladd's lyrical prowess and sound manipulation wizardry. "}
