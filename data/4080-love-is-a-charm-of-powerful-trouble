King's Bar & Grill in Times Square. In strides Elders Clapton and Richards, swinging some barbecue'n stogie incense around while incanting:The bluuuuuuuuuues is a lowdown shakin' chill. All [droning]: \"Yesss, preach 'emmm now.\"[All are seated.] Elder Clapton: Our first order of business is to congratulate our most recent inductee for his brilliant effort of forwarding the blues tradition by idiomatic and new means. A round of applause for Brother White, whose invention, \"the biscuit,\" has pushed forward exciting new sexual innuendos. Gentlemen, there hasn't been anything this newsworthy since the emergence of \"the jellyroll\" [snorts].[Round of applause and laughter goes up. Someone shouts: \"Yeah. Play the Blues!\"] Elder Richards: Now to the order of unfortunate business regarding the recent sacrilege of our Savior by two recent initiates, Brothers YZ and J.R.R. Token, who, outside of these walls, go by the name of The Immortal Lee County Killers. We have a few questions we'd like to pose to the two of you. Brother Shepherd: First off, what's with this \"Robert Johnson\" song that begins your latest album? It appears to be just a smattering of our Messiah's lines held together by detuned, lightgauge strings and some barely sussedout slide on top. I don't hear any twelvebar blues here. Brother YZ: We're from the South, so even though we're just playing sloppy punk with a slide, we get to call it \"the blues.\" By mewling out loud like I got a kidney stone and I'm fixin' to die, I am channeling the spirit of Johnson. I've even read Steven LaVere's transcriptions of Robert Johnson's songs, so I know what he says. Brother Thorogood: But shit, Brother YZ, you sound like Brother Spencer with that Crawlin' King Snake crammed down your craw on \"Shitcanned Again\" and almost every other dang thing here, be it an Otis Redding cover or an old gospel tune. That ain't exactly becoming. Brother Token: Yeah, well, I got more blues in what I coughed up this morning than the last fifty years of you fucks combined. When's the last time any of you could do something as sonically destitute as the void of \"Weak Brain, Narrow Mind\" and make it sound as evil as the living dead clawing their way out of the Mississippi mud? It might as well be Willie Dixon's skeleton rattling the hemorrhoids of yer lilywhite back doors. Brother Cooder: Well, since they wouldn't know Esu from Ruben Studdard, they sure can't boogie on R.L. Burnside's \"Goin' Down South\", slathering it instead with some redeye gravy of punk clatter. Brother Cray: And when they turn up, they're about as tasty as Kentucky Fried Goat. You gotta let that goat cook up real slow, boys. But even though your plumbdumb ineptitude and suburban caterwauling should mussy up the slower, fauxrhetorical titles like \"Truth Through Sound\", it's surprisingly nonodious and the best thing you do. Grand Wizard Richards: Agreed. You sure ain't the Gibson Brothers. You boys are much better at crawling than at galloping. Sullyin' up your own pot of beans is one thing, but to be plain messin' with the blues just won't cut it in these affluent circles. "}
