That's not to say that the Massachusetts couple guitarplaying, dogowning, unisonsinging hippies who, at least in song, seem as happy as any couple ever could be hasn't invoked Young before: Rather, their consistently tightening blend of folk, blues, rock, and improvisation has long owed debts to Young. The country sweetness of their last record for Ecstatic Peace! last year's Green Blues loosened the strings on something like Young's frontporch music, resulting in a delirious, nearperfect travelogue that was a little like the Crazy Horse of Ragged Glory recording Harvest Moon the next day on no sleep and strong weed. But Gettin' Gone is their Neil Young record: That is, every move they make from the brittle, Old Black electric guitar fuzz that opens and the omnipresent Shakey falsetto of Valentine to the quiet, surreal introspection that shapes its best moments is a winking nod to Young's sizable, rangy catalogue. Also, their dog, who is credited in the liner notes with bells, is named Zuma. In theory, then, Gettin' Gone could be perfect. Valentine and Elder are both strong, unorthodox guitarists capable with electric and acoustic arrangements, and their music's often been defined by that conscious looseness that Young listeners know so well. They've got friends here, J Mascis, Sunburned Hand of the Man's John Moloney and Ron Schneiderman, and an excellent pedal steer guitar player named Doc Dunn capable of lending a hand to that aesthetic. But Gettin' Gone lacks much vision or discipline, and over its 13 tracks and 65 minutes variegated snapshots from Young's career drift or drive in. It's an exhausting listen, a tribute to a worthy idol that often forsakes the talent of its makers in favor of proving it can cross Young's \"great divide.\" Opener \"Susquehanna (Sole Art Trample)\" staples the theme of Young's nature paean \"Country Home\" to Zuma's electric grit, but \"Day and Night\" breathes emotional unrest through acoustic bodies, much like \"Heart of Gold\". On \"Home Comfort\", Valentine moans through what Young would call \"a geographicalemotional love song.\" The acoustic guitar's low string buzzes in that late Young manner, and Valentine, on the brink of losing it on the road, laments, \"I always wanna look inside your eyes.\" Its unhinged opposite \"Colaed Out\", which drags Samara Lubelski and guitarist Willie Lane into the mess proves that MV & EE know that Young wrote \"Mr. Soul\" and collaborated with Sonic Youth.  But that doesn't make it memorable or even that good. Gettin' Gone seems so busied borrowing concepts and guitar sounds and vocal styles that it foregoes songwriting. And, if you're at all familiar with Young's catalogue, the moods MV & EE create (something they have done well hitherto) feel entirely secondhand. But Gettin' Gone does offer one glimpse of a mature, refined band capable of taking the Young (with some of the Band) paradigm and making it fit anew: \"The Burden\", which falls from the rocky cliffs of electric opener \"Susquehanna\" like a down feather, nods along a sweet, pensive progression, Elder and Dunn casting spectral lap and pedal steel rays beneath Valentine's voice. It's a rumination on the younger days, when they've been \"Down that road before/ Set some bars on before.\" \"But I still love you, even when it pours,\" Valentine offers as reassurance. It's an exquisite, fragile track that shoots up in flames when Valentine bends an Ethan Miller solo from his guitar. As for the next three tracks, good luck.  "}
