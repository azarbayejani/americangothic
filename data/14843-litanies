{"label":" Woodsist","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/15922/homepage_large.b6e1e82b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Royal Baths","title":"Litanies","text":" Many bands in the current San Francisco scene (the Fresh & Onlys, Sonny & the Sunsets, the Sandwitches) seem fixated with the jangly, flowerpowered melodies of the 1960s. Bay Area trio Royal Baths have an affinity for that decade, too only a different, darker part of it. Their debut fulllength, Litanies, draws from the noisier, more freakedout side of early garage rock. It also takes cues from Neil Young's lightningstruck guitar sermons and the Velvet Underground's creeping paranoia. The band's singers, Jeremy Cox and Jigmae Baer, favor a dualvoiced delivery that sounds like the VU's multinarrative sonic puzzle \"The Murder Mystery\".But for all the backwardlooking signifiers, there are some strangely coincidental presentday similarities, too: Cox and Baer's pitched voices and cracked delivery recall Woods' Jeremy Earl, whose Woodsist label is issuing Litanies. And the album's psychdamaged sound brings to mind yet another Woodsist band the skronkloving Moon Duo. Unlike that group, however, Royal Baths let their melodies shine through the muck, instead of burying them in swampy riffage. Before it folds into a deadened dirge, \"Nikki Don't\" is sprightly, with lightly delivered \"ba ba ba\"s and a touch of bells. Those \"ba ba ba\"s emerge again in one of Litanies' highlights, \"I Detest\", and they cut through that song's doomy chords with sharpness. Litanies' melodies don't struggle with the darker moments; instead, they work within and alongside them.Still much of Litanies sounds blackened both by the distancing effects of the production quality and by the sheer maelstrom of Cox and Baer's guitar fuzz. Their lyrics often contribute to this shadowed atmosphere: \"Sitting in My Room\" starts off as a promise (\"In the morning/ The morning will be there/ And we're not there yet/ But we'll get there\") that turns into a plea, \"Here I am/ I am high/ And I'm too high to/ Go to bed.\" Even the innocuously titled \"Pleasant Feeling\" seems to be about the inward effects of heroin use, with the postinjection entreaty to \"Close the doors/ The light's too bright.\" The darkness suits these folks better anyway.
