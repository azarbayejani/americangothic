{"label":" Woodsist","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16523/homepage_large.45d584cd.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Zach Kelly","artist":"Nodzzz","title":"Innings","text":" When they released their 2008 debut, San Francisco trio Nodzzz were just one of many jangly, lofi guitar acts making waves. As Pitchfork's Joe Colly noted at the time, there was a chance they'd \"face similar (and probably misguided) backlashdriven criticism\" that would eventually befall similar coolcredchasing bands. But Nodzzz, quite oppositely, couldn't have been any less cool childlike, cleareyed, and at times offputtingly cheery, their geeky earnestness set them apart, and no amount of tape crust could hide it. Suffice it to say, if you liked Nodzzz, there's no possible way you won't like Innings, a followup that often proves almost indistinguishable from its predecessor. Still adhering to the same Idon'twannagrowup mentality and sprightly, brief songs, the band's motto remains the same, paraphrased pointedly on \"True to Life\": \"If you must make a picture, it should be true to life.\" After all, the record is called Innings because cosongwriters Anthony Atlas and Sean Paul Presley spent their formative years playing baseball together. Opener \"Always Make Your Bed\" uses a simple chore to frame the idea of retreating home when the world beats you down. \"(Low) Energy\" seems to be about needing a cup of coffee. So yes, Nodzzz keep it simple and short (14 tracks at 23 minutes), and don't seem too interested in switching things up, which is fine: Their aloofness is a big part of the draw. What has changed is the address, as Nodzzz are now a part of the Woodsist roster. After playing with Woods and Real Estate last year, the linkup seemed inevitable. Besides, if there's one band that Nodzzz share a true kinship with, it's Woods. The production has also been cleaned up a little, leaving room for some excellent little guitar tricks that feel properly spotlit, not showoffy (dudes don't do \"showoffy\"). Nodzzz songs are categorically repetitive to the point of homogeneity, so these little moments the weird tunings on \"Time (What's It Going To Do?)\", the riffedout \"Troubled Times\" all display welcome finesse. Which isn't to say their wholeÂ affable, Muppetlike bop can't get on your nerves. But for every silly dud (\"Ye Olde Indian Towne\"), there's something like \"Heyday Past Heyday Due\", a rare minorkey track about the realization that life's party might be winding down. Innings might not be your cup of tea, but there's little denying its charm as Atlas and Presley suggest, \"If it don't got soul or spirit, no one will come near it.\" Which is clearly not something they need to worry about.
