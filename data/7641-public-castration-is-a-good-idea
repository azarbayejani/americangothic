I review one album for Pitchfork and suddenly I'm the resident expert on all things Swans. I don't dislike them, mind you, but it's not like they're my favoritest band in the world. It wouldn't be so bad if Michael Gira wasn't so damned prolific; we're going on two years since Swans actually broke up and they're still releasing albums no new material, mind you, just live recordings and rereleases of old albums. Public Castration is a Good Idea falls under both categories: a live album from 1986, being rereleased on Thirsty Ear. Four and a half minutes of slow, relentless bashing opens Public Castration, which is a good way to prepare you for what lies ahead: sparse, gothic instrumentation, blunt trauma percussion, and Gira's tortured moans. It's terribly bleak and repetitive, and easy to dismiss if you're not in the right mood. On the other hand, if you are in the right mood which would be utter disgust with yourself and everyone else in the world then lines like, \"I'm your stupid child/ I'm your stupid helpless child/ I'm your stupid naked child,\" become viciously effective. Lord knows what the Columbine killers would have done if they had listened to Swans. (Mmm... probably the same thing, come to think of it.)Public Castration is a Good Idea shows Swans in their most basic form, before Gira began tinkering and expanding their sound in the ensuing years. I personally prefer their early to mid '90s work, as this feels a bit too skeletal, but that's just me. Besides, there's no denying the intrinsic entertainment value of having a copy of Public Castration is a Good Idea around the house. The title alone is enough to freak out your parents and roommates; imagine what'll happen if you actually play it for them. "}
