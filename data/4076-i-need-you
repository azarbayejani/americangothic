{"label":" Badman","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/4033/homepage_large.25b46ec8.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amanda Petrusich","artist":"Ill Lit","title":"I Need You","text":" Ever since the softfocus singer/songwriter boom of the late 70s, our critical and conversational lexicons have stretched to include a bucketful of lame euphemisms for \"nice\" check the everubiquitous \"soothing,\" the halfassed \"sweet,\" or the justbarelyacompliment \"effortless.\" Much like scoffing at the Pernice Brothers' supersyrupy pop, it's awfully easy to unconsciously deride the BrooklynbywayofL.A. folk collective Ill Lit for being stupidly comforting, particularly given their tendency to reassure in geeky, predictable ways with gentle acoustic guitars, quivering strings, and soft, honeyed warbles. In \"The Passing Lights\", vocalist/songwriter Daniel Ahearn hungrily indicts a lost lover as \"too cute to be trusted,\" and it's impossible not to wonder if Ahearn's felt the brunt of that sentiment himself, instantly dismissed for his band's sometimes overwhelming palatability. Being called earnest may no longer seem like very much of a compliment, but Ill Lit are still a defiantly compelling band, with generous, lilting melodies, evocative lyrics, and low, salty guitars, all sunsets and cacti, highways and road soda. Like country/folk/electronic brethren the Fruit Bats and Holopaw, Ill Lit attempt to temper their twang with bits of synth and stray 808 beats, building toward a vaguely more accurate version of Americana, with technology and human hands quietly colliding and pushing toward an agreeable medium. Although I Need You is significantly less synthetic than its predecessor, 2002's blipheavy WACMusic, the communion of steel strings and hardware feels more serendipitous this time, with rickety Moog lines petering in and out, drum machines fading into actual kits, and songwriting superseding gimmickry. Opener \"MidCity\" introduces Ahearn's lonesome croon, billowing out in generally striking (if unpredictable) ways, over a loose base of drums, spare beats, electric guitar and keyboards, ending in the perfectly perplexing assertion, \"I'm almost out of space here/ Cannot tell the girls from the wait staff.\" \"Spring Chicken\" is a popperfect bit of altcountry, beset by a frail, ethereal synth whisper, like a ghost shooting through the farm, blowing up stalks of hay before finally crashing facefirst into a wall. \"Broken Open Fence\" starts in a fleeting haze of feedback, drifting into acoustic guitar and doubled, broken vocals, wisps of drone kicking up and then politely receding.I Need You is an unmistakably selfserious record, painstakingly composed and gracefully executed; on paper, Ill Lit's deliberate compositions may seem capable of eliciting groans from even the most forgiving listeners, who still can't help but wiggle away from the band's imposing sincerity. But clench your fists and try for a second: If you can just swallow your kneejerk smirk, there are things here to grin about. "}
