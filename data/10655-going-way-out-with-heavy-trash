It's a question that has baffled critics for ages, or at least since whenever in the 1990s the collective decision was made to define the decade's overarching tone as \"ironic.\" The man's got his share of selfaware affectations; how can anyone who sings like he does in this day and age not be persistently conscious of a debt not just to Elvis, but to a whole lifetime's worth of comedyElvis hucksters? Whether those affectations are in the service of minstrelsytwiceremoved and a disconnected Southern fetishism depends on whom you ask: Robert Christgau stomped a mudhole in Spencer circa 1994 for using his \"culturalchronological advantages\" to make 60s and 70s bloozerawk into what purists would consider a farcical grotesquerie, but Jon isn't so much a signifier or a standin as he is a largely unserious personality who willingly let the blues do more damage to him than he could feasibly do to it. I suppose asking him wouldn't hurt, in which case you could go by his interviews and note his frequent admittances that the blues and rockabilly and preBeatles rock in general is just, well, something he likes and thinks is cool. A fair enough explanation. Hearing nothing motivationally other than \"I like it, might as well play it\" in Heavy Trash will at least help you along towards enjoying the record a lot more, even as it like anything that seems at least somewhat deliberately anachronistic might leave you asking what its place is in the here and now. It's the same question a lot of people ask after seeing a Tarantino film: does he think all those popculture asides are cool on their own terms, or did they have to get old and disused first? In the latter case, there's typically some sort of kitsch factor embedded in the final product, which is one of the things that Going Way Out With Heavy Trash doesn't seem to run on. A kitsch merchant might stop right around \"Charlie Feathers sang all hiccupy\" or \"I want a modified Gretsch exactly like the one Eddie Cochran played,\" but Spencer and cohort Matt VertaRay subtly place themselves over your typical rockabilly Xerox acts by drawing out the more eccentric, individual quirks that the original 50s artists didn't bury under a nostalgia that hadn't happened yet. And how legitimate are these quirks? Well, three of the songs have titles that end with the word \"baby\" (and they all start pretty goofily, too: \"Kissy Baby\", \"She Baby\", and \"Crazy Pritty Baby\"); there's a raveup number called \"They Were Kings\" that exists to give gratitude to rock revivalists of years past like the Gories and the Cheater Slicks (\"Misunderstood geniuses of arock'n'roll... wearin' sideburns\"); and Jon screams \"Everybody say yes please/ Everybody say no thank you/ I wanna suck my brain out my eyeball\" in the first twenty seconds of \"I Want Oblivion\" like some combination of Johnnies Rotten and Burnette. At least to a point, it's punkstyle irreverent without being entirely blasphemous, and Heavy Trash have a certain winking levity to 'em; if they didn't, what the hell would they be doing getting Tony Millionaire to do their album art?  But Going Way Out isn't a Pomadeslicked exercise in giggling like an idiot at that kooky hillbilly music, not when they're playing like they do. Spencer's voice might be have some artifice to it, but it's an affectionate one, and it does some flatout crazy shit: leaping and hitching and growling and cackling, turning huge gulps of air into a sort of percussion, even going threequarters Man in Black on \"That Ain't Right\" (just far enough to avoid crossing over into Cheech and Chong's \"Johnny Stash\" parody turf). VertaRay's guitar completes the doublefrontman equation with a style that pushes Cochran, Link Wray, and Luther Perkins a couple decades closer to punk in a way Joe Strummer did in his later years, while his notebending hacksaw riffs on \"I Want Oblivion\" and dilatedpupil screeches on the scuzzy, Beefhearty beatnik hobolament blues dirge \"You Can't Win\" stand out just as much as the more traditional twangs and snarls that power the likes of \"She Baby\" and \"Kissy Baby\".  The choice to recruit three different groups to record with including Canadian altcountry band the Sadies (who give \"Outside Chance\" a 1967 Stones feel), a Danish group made up of members of surfrock pranksters Tremolo Beer Gut, garage weirdos Powersolo (magnificently eerie on \"Crying Tramp\"), and New York session hands Simon Chardiet and Phil Hernandez (a rocksolid rhythm section on \"Pure Gold\" and \"Way Out\") keeps things diverse. Going Way Out With Heavy Trash is a lot of things wild, aged, loose, dangerous, ridiculous, respectful but it's not a joke. Even if it is kinda funny.  "}
