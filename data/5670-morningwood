{"label":" Capitol","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/5594/homepage_large.9546410c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Adam Moerder","artist":"Morningwood","title":"Morningwood","text":" Haters seeking a new target for bilious, firebellied screeds are going to love Morningwood: They're yet another NYC retrorock retread, their bassist used to drum for the Wallflowers, and, yes, of all the possible bandnames in the whole entire world, they chose \"Morningwood.\" If taking swings at them seems easy, it ought to. In the aftermath of late70s garagerock hangovers, they sound exactly as you'd expect hints of new wave crossing paths with uninspired powerpop and jackleg dancerock. And yet, despite their readymade niche, their hype's been tepid in a postholiday indie rock market blueballed by a disappointing Strokes album. Morningwood pride themselves as a \"fun\" band by infusing their music with energy and sexuality. The reality is, cutting a decent record takes more than a kooky stageshow and an insatiable urge to embarrass yourself. It also takes more than handclaps, callandresponse vocals, and dumb cheerleader cadences which, incidentally, just about sums up Morningwood's current single \"Nth Degree\", a kind of theme song the band is pushing as a means of introducing themselves to an apathetic public. Where better throwbacks such as Brooklynbased Blood on the Wall overcome their heavily earmarked influences, Morningwood don't even try to put a unique spin on their pilfering: Their tracklist reads like an AudioScrobbler profile, systematically tallying new wave and glam ingredients in ways only machines and computerbrains can. Like many styleoversubstance rockers before them, Morningwood sink or swim largely on the strength of its frontperson, in this case Chantel Claret, an ingenue undeservedly netting comparisons to Karen O and Siouxsie Sioux. Though a touch of early Pretenders or Runaways may occasionally poke through for necessary grit, Claret snags more persona and influence from pop princesses past and present: \"Nth Degree\" is a poor woman's Gwen Stefani rapping on Franz Ferdinand demos, replacing the nowlegendary \"BANANAS\" chant with the vastly more mindless \"MO/ MOR/ MORNING/ WOOD.\" Similarly, \"New York Girls\" spoils the album's best bassline with a shoutout straight from Bring It On: \"NNNNew York girls, come on, you know you're hot/ AAAAttitude, and that's what makes you rock!!\" That attitude carries over to Claret's lyrics: \"Take Off Your Clothes\" painfully xeroxes \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", subbing teen angst for locker room hormones as she gasps, \"Your happy trail, it's in my happy trail/ And your treasure trial, let's see what goes down!\" until exSpacehog guitarist Richard Steel ejaculates an imitation Joey Santiago riff for the chorus. Here and elsewhere, producer Gil Norton immaculately regenerates his past work for Pixies and Echo & the Bunnymen, though even occasionally recycling those great old sonics can't rescue these songs. As if the songwriting didn't show its wires enough, \"Nth Degree\" invites you to \"rock n' roll,\" \"disco,\" and \"turn up the radio,\" but does so with tongueincheek instead of fists in the air. So not even Morningwood take themselves too seriously, but instead of offering playful, engaging pop music, we get new wave retreads and a couple of rock journeymen and the whole thing comes off like an overgrown episode of MTV's \"Making the Band\".
