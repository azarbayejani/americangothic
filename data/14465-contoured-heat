True to all the musical strands they've been winding, the band skirts no indulgence on its third and apparently final album, aiming for raw and visceral thrills as often as it breaks for lengthy instrumental passages and extended guitar solos. There's both a studiousness and an audible joy in these longer, more complex songs that makes you wonder what the members of Mass Shivers have been hiding in their record collections all this time, and why they've been holding it back and what they might have accomplished if they'd pushed themselves a little further.Mass Shivers pared down to guitar, drums, and bass for this album, though the guitar overdubs are judicious, and rarely does the band stop from stuffing a track with ideas between the three of them. Maybe it's because the music itself has grown more layered and demands more finesse that singer and guitarist Brett Sova attempts a more earnest, less excitable singing voice here. On opener \"More Bumper Than a Body Shop\", his breathy, detached turn makes an effective contrast with the band's bluster. But while the band finds the chops and vision to stretch out, the vocals often sound halfhearted or timid in comparison elsewhere it's as if there's a growth spurt here for the band, but some awkwardness still left to get over on otherwise convincingly bruising and psychedelic tracks like \"Languid Liquid\" or \"Anonynominous\".But despite complex song structures that glide gracefully in the hands of the band and consistently great performances from behind the drum kit, the record falls into a homogenous rut in part from the uniformity of guitar sounds, no matter how busy they are. Oddly, some of the instrumental interludes bear the most vivid moments: \"Bilateral Dysfunction\" gets plenty of mileage from just a few notes of clean guitar as counterpoint to a searing lead a contrast the rest of the album could have benefited from.The band has pushed themselves in a few different directions over the years, especially on last years' single for \"Torrid Sex in East Berlin\" (included here), a sinewy groove paired with the Bside \"Tickled on Poppers\", some of the heaviest and most manic music they've ever laid down. But rather than an opportunity to stretch further, Contoured Heat searches for nuance and possibly transcendence in the sounds they've been exploring thus far. Were it not their final record, one could look at it as a promising transitional moment for the band; instead, Contoured Heat is another example of potential not fully realized. "}
