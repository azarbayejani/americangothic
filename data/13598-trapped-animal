{"label":" Narnack","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/14613/homepage_large.267eb5c7.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"The Slits","title":"Trapped Animal","text":" \"The new album is really just another third recorded album. It's just a continuation of the Slits.\" That's Ari Up, in a Pitchfork news interview, giving folks a hint on what to expect, or perhaps not expect, from Trapped Animal. Up also told us the Slits were adding dancehall to their burgeoning bag of tricks which is to say, some longtime fans who weathered the sea change between Cut's punky reggae party and the murky dubbedout Return of the Giant Slits might not be following Jamaican music and the Slits into the digital age.But make no mistake, Trapped Animal is, for better or worse, a Slits album Mark E. Smith's quip about the Fall being the Fall even if it's just Smith and your granny on the bongos seems to apply here with Ari Up (assuming your granny exchanges her bongos for a melodica). The involvement of original bassist Tessa Pollitt helps make this record's claim to the group's name a little easier to swallow, but it's Ari Up who embodies the group's indomitable je ne sais quoi. And no matter how far these tunes may go astray from what folks recognize as \"Slits tradition,\" Ari does her best to bring these songs back into the fold.Conveniently, the album provides fencesitting listeners with a likeitorlumpit test right at the start. \"Ask Ma\" has Up and friends putting mothers on blast for doing a poor job raising their sons, and for making the Aris of the world have to put up with and clean up after these sorts of men, because even though moms have it tough (since men are keeping them down), \"who's to blame when we get messedup men?\" If you know of any cryptofeminists desperate for their own \"I Am Woman\", point them in this direction. For your sake, I just hope they're not sticklers for quality rhymes the couplet that pairs up \"pick up the pieces\" with \"life's feces\" might be tough for even the most fervent acolyte to stomach. That the music behind such awkward and foggy notions is more than capable only makes these words tougher to bear.This sort of musical/lyrical qualitative disjoint is all over Trapped Animal, with the latter half of the equation usually the guilty party. It's not so much that the album tries to tackle significant issues (like psychological trauma, or the Rastafarian view of Western culture), but that it's torn between actually tackling them headon or simply playing a twohand touch. A plodding gonowhere tune like \"Issues\" suffers because of this indecision, and the less said about the didactic \"history lesson\" offered in the rootsy \"Babylon\", the better. More tunes with an honest sense of perspective, like \"Peer Pressure\", would've been welcome. It also helps that \"Peer Pressure\" features some of the playfulness that brings to mind fond memories of the group's good old days Up acts as her own onewoman jungle, acrobatically trilling and cooing as the rest of the group chants \"peer pressure!\" over and over like a playground taunt.Tracks like \"Peer Pressure\" and \"Reject\" manage the difficult trick of being musically Cutting without being warmedover rehashes of past glories. Sadly, these are the exception more than the rule. The tunes on this record either take an admirable sentiment (like the call to follow your dreams and not the money in \"Pay Rent\") and mushmouth it into a strident polemic, or they just start eating their own foot the minute Ari opens her mouth. An unfortunate example of the latter is \"Reggae Gypsy\", which sounds as advertised, but makes that sound in the most obvious (read: worst) possible way. Of course, the album also includes \"Can't Relate\", a buoyant dubby tune that actually does right by the notion of gypsyflavored reggae. It's buried on the far end of the album's back half with another highlight, \"Cry\", an unapologetic rocksteady ballad.Given the confused beast that Trapped Animal turned out to be, it seems like the title track's focused on the wrong prisoner, that it's actually the band that's trapped, with the Slits' history and legacy acting as the gilded cage. Returning from nearly two decades of inactivity (barring one spotty EP and a handful of live shows) with a wideranging album that further expanded the definition of what the Slits were, while still maintaining fidelity to the infectious and creative fuckall spirit that fueled the group during its heyday in other words, a true continuation would've been a welcome, and widely appreciated, statement. Instead, Trapped Animal is nothing more than an oddsandsods record being passed off as \"business as usual\" by a band that doesn't seem to know what that business is anymore. "}
