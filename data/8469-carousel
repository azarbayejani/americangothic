It's usually not even appropriate June of 44's punchy sound was far from the fluid motions of naval life. Rachel's epic The Sea and the Bells must have marked a turning point, because since then, I admit to having heard a diffusion of its effects in Louisvillerelated projects like the Shipping News. But then there are bands like Volta Do Mar, whose knifesharp transmissions are more appropriate for a turn on the highway than the sea. Maybe Steppenwolf's \"Born to Be Wild\" and Rush's \"Red Barchetta\" forever closed that road to the scene. Victory at Sea argue otherwise on Carousel. The vibe on the trio's second fulllength shifts without warning from warmth to biting cold, and on the most emotionally gripping songs, lyrical hints of roadtrip imagery are tied to the breakup of a relationship. It's dark rock in the vein of the Afghan Whigs; I'm thinking particularly of the guest vocals of Scrawl's Marcy Mays on \"My Curse.\" Victory at Sea frontwoman Mona Elliott croons with a similar ache on the opener, \"Third Place.\" Her guitar meanders softly with shuffling percussion in the beginning as she sings, \"From one place to another, not one word to each other.\" Drummer Fin Moore and bassist Mel Lederman weave rolling rhythms together, accelerating into a fiery chorus as Elliott admits that she can't repress memory forever. Elliott's voice also reminds me of a sweeter Thalia Zedek, short of a few thousand packs of cigarettes. Turns out to be an appropriate connection Lederman played piano on Zedek's Been Here and Gone, and Zedek returns the favor in the company of a chorus of women for the conclusion of \"The Open Road.\" Moore proves his prodigious skill on this song, cycling through a series of rolls and crashes like an eightarmed Vedic god, his propulsion only enhanced by the brooding plod of the bass. \"The sun hit the windshield like a rock from the sky,\" Elliott remembers, her only lyric in the song. Then, the inevitable pause, patience, and the soaring chorus and climax that never fails to send a chill up my spine. Whereas the previous songs begin at one destination and end entirely at another, \"The Blizzard of '78\" is Victory at Sea's most \"pop\" song. Elliott's guitar chimes almost cheerily as she describes her street, buried in snow: \"The sun, it reflected from the ice to the windows and antennas from the cars shot through the new, higher ground; it was the last time I remember us together.\" Two verses, two choruses, and then a punchy melody at the ending that will leave you humming for hours but unsure whether you're happy or just damned miserable. Too bad every song can't quite match that lyricism. \"The Driver\" builds well, with a bluesy riff and shimmering cymbals. Moore kicks in, transforming the piece to a stomping rocker, but Elliott loses steam: \"You can drive much faster than me/ I am sometimes much older.\" But the rest of the songs lead the listener through more convoluted paths. \"Angel\" opens with a muted trumpet, and amidst the slow, tense rhythm, Elliott sings of \"wings homemade, crocheted out of hearts\" of the other jealous angels. The song cuts short before more can be revealed, but likewise, on the closer, \"Mermaid,\" she warns that \"they need water to breathe\" but the water has spilled out. You don't need to flesh out these curious figures to enjoy the turbulent drums and scraping feedback on this final track. \"Remember,\" two tracks before, might have been a more appropriate closer, though, with Lederman's electric piano echoing like a bittersweet Disintegration ballad. I worry that my words haven't done justice to this excellent album. Just imagine a cold winter in the band's hometown of Boston, and all the icy intensity and seasonal weariness that might entail. In case it wasn't obvious, this is one for the road. "}
