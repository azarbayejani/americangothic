There were probably 50 people in attendance. Thirty seconds into their first song, lead singer Nick Johnston a poutyhandsome blond kid with wispy bangs and the lithe, compact frame of a skater ran into the audience. He leapt onto the bar. He jumped back onstage and ran through every lead singer pose in rock history in three minutes. The energy was equal parts dumbfounding and disarming, and it sent a resounding message: Cut Off Your Hands are rock stars.Or rather, they will be within the year, if they have anything to say about it. After a brief, uneventful stint as a Dischordstyle hardcore punk band in their hometown of Auckland, New Zealand, they moved to London, hooked up with Libertines producer and exSuede guitarist Bernard Butler, and abandoned their hardcore roots. On You and I, their fulllength debut, they aim for a synthesis of starryeyed Britpop with postpunk's brittle rhythms and girlgroup harmonies. On lead track \"Happy As Can Be\" it meshes incredibly well: Over a downfromValhalla drum roll straight out of \"Then He Kissed Me\" and rumbling guitars, Johnston yelps a descending melody in his baby Robert Smith tenor that recalls \"Be My Baby\" when it doesn't echo \"Please Please Me\" while his compatriots bellow \"whoaohohs\" into the great beyond. From there, Cut Off Your Hands get more winsome (\"Oh Girl\", \"Turn Cold\", \"Still Fond\"), more wry (\"It Doesn't Matter\"), and more confrontational (\"Expectations\"), but, though the journey is boppy and ingratiating, they never rebottle the lightning of \"Happy As Can Be\". It's certainly not for lack of trying: Between quoting an encyclopedia'sworth of UK guitar pop influences (Buzzcocks! The Smiths! The Jam! Collect 'em all!) they also somehow manage to lift the melody of Weezer's \"Holiday\" wholesale for \"Heartbreak\".In their slightly glib mastery of popsong forms, and their apparent belief that great pop music can be forged through sheer force of will, Cut Off Your Hands sometimes recall Bloc Party. The difference, thankfully, is that Nick Johnston seems far more appraochable and grounded. One shudders to think what Bloc Party singer Kele Okereke might do with a song title like \"In the Name of Jesus Christ\"; Johnston, in a moment of pure Ray Davies, mostly just uses it to wryly point out that his mom's best friend's husband, the church accountant, \"stole from everyone we knew.\" He flashes a similar impishness on the selfdeprecating \"It Doesn't Matter\", a sunny ode to his afternoon hangover that boasts a chorus nearly matching firstalbum Killers for swagger. Johnston might want to keep that shiteating grin around for the inevitable indie stardom that surely awaits him; it's a good look. "}
