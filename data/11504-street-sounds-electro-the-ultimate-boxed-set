That's basically what he did when he set up Street Sounds, the subsidiary to his dance label Streetwave, and released the first Street Sounds Electro compilation in 1983: here were eight tracks out of the United States that would've cost a couple of dozen quid for a UK buyer to import, all collected together for a price under five pounds. As a business decision, it was pretty shrewd, but as a scenemaker it was flatout seismic: Thanks to the budget pricing and each volume's two sides of tight, continuous mixing from the likes of Herbie Laidley and the Mastermind sound system, the 22volume Street Sounds Electro series later Street Sounds Hip Hop Electro and finally just Street Sounds Hip Hop was a major factor in defining what UK Bboys caught on to in the hiphop world between 1983 and 1988.Street Sounds Electro: The Ultimate Boxed Set includes all 22 volumes of this influential series collected in mp3 form on two CDRs, preserving the DJ mixes as they initially appeared on the original vinyl. In many ways, it's a fortunate time capsule that hits on a lot of the nowiconic electro and rap classics of the midlate 1980s and what sort of context they came from. Yet it also offers a deeper, messier variation on the evolution of hiphop, one that covers most of the major bases between the old school and the sample era Grandmaster Flash, RunD.M.C., the Roxanne wars, the dawn of golden age icons like BDP and Eric B. & Rakim and EPMD then complicates it all by throwing in a lot of strange stuff that history completely forgot, for reasons both unfair and justified. Just to give you a quick rundown of what was included in initial 11 volumes: Three cuts from West Coast electro master Egyptian Lover, including a 10:21 remix of 1985's allkindsofnasty \"Girls\", five tracks from the BBoys of \"Two, Three, Break\" fame, Cybotron's 1984 genrename progenitor \"Techno City\", and the infamous Herbie Hancock \"Megamix\" put together by Grandmixer D.St. Then, of course, there are the anthems: Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel's \"White Lines\", Freestyle's \"Don't Stop the Rock\", Rockmaster Scott and the Dynamic Three's \"The Roof Is on Fire\", West Street Mob's \"Break Dance  Electric Boogie\", Mantronix's \"Needle to the Groove\", Hashim's \"AlNaafiysh (The Soul)\", and Arthur Baker's \"Breakers Revenge\", just for starters. With the exception of the largely overlooked Afrika Bambaataa, whose only appearance in the entire series is a twominute fragment of \"Bambaataa's Theme (Assault on Precinct 13)\" in Volume 13's clusterbomb of a mix, this is one of the more complete collections of electro and danceprovoking rap out there.  While the significant presence of classic earlymid 80s rap integrated itself into the tenor of each Street Sounds edition or sometimes clashed against it, like the slow, wobbly dubbedout strutbounce of Rammellzee vs. KRob's \"Beat Bop\" did amongst the otherwise uptempo popandlock fodder of 1983's Volume 2 it started to gradually dominate the series as a whole, swapping out the vocodersandKraftwerk vibe of classic electro for the harder, sparser sounds of hip hop's first hardcore phase. The second disc, covering Volumes 1222, bears this out over time. The aforementioned Volume 13 megamix (originally released in 1986) reduces 21 tracks to a fragment of their original lengths typically between 90 seconds and three and a half minutes and streams them together in a largely seamless twoside blend of rap, r&b, and even synthpop: one stretch features the early (and ridiculous) Sir MixaLot single \"Square Dance Rap\", electro favorite Captain Rock's \"Return of Capt. Rock\", and a remix of the Information Society single \"Running\", before later going on to drop hiphop classics like \"PeeWee's Dance\" and \"Eric B. Is President\".  By 1987, the word \"Electro\" started disappearing from the compilation's now \"Hip Hop\"focused titles, the 808s slowed down drastically and samplebased cuts by the Ultramagnetic MCs (\"Traveling at the Speed of Thought\"; \"Funky\") and J.V.C. F.O.R.C.E. (\"Strong Island\"; \"Doing Damage\") started making their way into the mix. By '88, the last year of the Street Sounds Electro series, the closest it got to uptempo electrorap was Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock's \"It Takes Two\" by which time it was on its way to bypassing the whole \"electro\" thing entirely and getting identified as \"hiphouse.\" It's an illuminating history, an evolution of sound in a sort of beyondcanonical macrocosm.  And by \"beyondcanonical macrocosm\", I mean there's a lot of extraneous crap. Some of it's fascinating, like Levi 167's \"Something Fresh to Swing To\", which shows up on 1988's Volume 20, builds up this monster drum machine rhythm and then sneaks in this occasional recurring sequence of Casio notes that sounds like the kind of melody the RZA would build a Bobby Digital track around 10 years later. And there's a good number of obscure midlate 80s getdrunkandyell party anthems, like Bay Area crew A.T.C.'s \"This Beat is Def\" (featuring production from a young Paris) and the Almighty ElCee's hardhitting motormouth showcase \"We Have Risen\". But with a collection like this that was compiled as the scene actually happened and developed, there's no 20/20 hindsight to keep the mediocrities out, and there's plenty of them ranging from the Packman's grating Volume 1 opener \"I'm the Packman (Eat Everything I Can)\" to the Diaz Brothers' mostlyuseless Dirty Harryquoting \"It Takes Two\" megamix/knockoff \"Here We Go Again\" on Volume 22. In between there's Newcleus' godawful corny \"Huxtable House Party\" (which I'd like to think is what turned Bill Cosby against rap in the first place), CIA's bizarre Beastie Boys ripoff \"My Posse\" (written by Ice Cube and produced by Dr. Dre! In 1988!), Exhibit A against the idea of swing rap in The Jury's \"The Cotton Club\", the gooey, cloying saxophones all over KeyMatic's \"Breakin' in Space\", and a whole lot of stuff that sounds a bit like Arthur Baker only with fewer ideas. This is one of those collections where you take the bad with the good, and there's more than enough of both.  Given how limited a pressing this collection is, your chances of being able to find this for yourself are fairly slim, and between the cost ($80+ American) and the headache of trying to find it anywhere, it might not necessarily be worth the effort, especially with many of the more desirable rarities included in mixed, cut, reedited, and otherwise incomplete form. But when it works, it's definitely worth hearing. There's a third disc on this thing, by the way a DVD that includes a bunch of great music videos not just from electro and hip hop artists like Bambaataa and the Jonzun Crew and Man Parrish, but also fellow travelers Art of Noise, pop analogues New Order and progenitors Kraftwerk. It's a fine collection, and it might be the best part of the whole box, for one important reason: someone actually had the good sense to wait 25 years and see what was worth including after the fact.
