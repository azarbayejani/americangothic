{"label":" Blanco y Negro","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/5544/homepage_large.fcd7a3f2.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stephen M. Deusner","artist":"Cerys Matthews","title":"Cockahoop","text":" Either the songs on former Catatonia frontwoman Cerys Matthews' first solo effort, Cockahoop, were recorded in tracklist order, or this album is a triumph of sequencing. It begins tentatively with \"Chardonnay\", an unrecorded ode to white wine by Nashville songwriter Roger Cook; gradually becomes more confident over the first half; hits its stride just before the instrumental interlude; peaks over three songs; and ends on a hopeful note with an arrangement of the traditional \"All My Trials\". Perhaps this progression wouldn't be so noteworthy or even as noticeable if it were assembled by any other artist. But Cockahoop is Matthews' first recorded work since Catatonia's lackluster final album, Paper Scissors Stone, which followed her stint in rehab and preceded the band's dissolution in 2001. After some time off, Matthews decamped to Nashville to work with producer and lap steel player Bucky Baxter, who helped corral an impressive roster of local country music veterans like pedal steel player Lloyd Green, former Notorious Cherry Bomb Richard Bennett, and bassist Dave Pomeroy, as well as former Wilco drummer Ken Coomer and Old Crow Medicine Show banjoist Ketcham Secor. The result is certainly influenced by Nashville country, but like some sort of exchange student program, it also incorporates British elements, including bazouki and bass flute. Lending to the international vibe, Matthews sings \"La Bague\" in French and the traditional hymn \"Arglwydd Dyma Fi\" in her native Welsh.Cockahoop dynamically reflects Matthews' reimmersion into music. The first half (before the intermission) sounds like she's dipping her toe in the water, easing into the sessions not timidly, but warily, as if disappointment looms. \"Chardonnay\" is a brave choice to kick off a postrehab album, and \"Caught in the Middle\" and \"Louisiana\" are lowkey excursions on which Matthews sounds like she's holding back vocally. Her delivery is whispery and subdued compared to her powerhouse vocals on Catatonia songs like \"Road Rage\" and \"Apple Core.\" She sounds vulnerable here battered a bit by life, but still wideeyed and hopeful. By the second half, starting with \"Arglwydd Dyma Fi\", her vocals have grown bolder and much more confident she sings \"If You're Lookin' for Love\" like a giddy comeon, even cracking up on the second verse as Baxter adds banjolele, bass harp, dobro, and saxophone. The rafterraising \"The Good in GoodBye\" features a fuller sound and a brassy performance that owes more to Nashville legends like Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn than to anything Catatonia recorded. The only dud comes with the Handsome Family cover \"Weightless Again\". Singing Rennie Sparks' lines, Matthews pretends to know the answer to \"Why people O.D. on pills/ And jump from the Golden Gate Bridge.\" It is, of course, \"to feel weightless again.\" But Cockahoop sounds best when Matthews doesn't pretend to have the answers, as on the closer \"All My Trials,\" where she calmly accepts that \"all my trials, lord, will soon be over.\" "}
