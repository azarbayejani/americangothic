In nurturing the careers of Will Oldham, Jim O'Rourke, and Bill Callahan, the label helped lay the foundation in the 1990s for what has come to be known as the New Weird America, yet it has upheld an equally fervent desire from Royal Trux to the Fucking Champs to Monotonix to rock in the U.S.A. Likewise, Chasny's three albums for Drag City since his 2005 signing have displayed a similar balance of these twin affinities, infusing his meditative acoustic excursions with a magmathick electric guitar squall imported from his sideline gig with San Fran acidrockers Comets on Fire.What's more, after a steady stream of releases on various microindies, trading up to Drag City affords Chasny the opportunity to illuminate the more neglected corners of his dense discography. But the 2xCD/triplevinyl set RTZ is no straightforward career retrospective. Rather than present a linear overview of Chasny's preDrag City progression, its sidelong movements are seemingly sequenced according to their degree of obscurity: four pieces (average length: 18 minutes) pulled variously from split12\" releases, subscriptiononly CDs, and Chasny's personal tape stash, followed by a reissue of 1999's Nightly Trembling album, whose original release (as legend has it) was limited to 33 copies.RTZ (aka Return to Zero) is named for the reset button found on Tascam fourtrack recorders, the device that documented these recordings and, in light of the more singer/songwriterly nature of Chasny's recent albums, the collection is a timely, if at times exhaustive, introduction to the Six Organs origin myth. Chasny, of course, was not the only psychedelically minded artist in the late 1990s enamored with cheap homerecording technology, but where the likes of Guided by Voices and the Elephant 6 collective often used fourtracks as a means to recapture a certain AMradio innocence, Chasny's early Six Organs recordings emphasize the medium's corrosive, claustrophobic qualities.The opening fivepart suite, \"Resurrection\" (taken from a 2000 split EP with Charalambides) establishes the various modes a perpetual drift between lunacy and ludicity and fascination with Eastern mysticism that play out on the rest of RTZ (and throughout the entire Six Organs discography, for that matter). An intense, introductory flurry of acoustic plucks approximating the sound of a sitar being ripped apart with a screwdriver yields to the melancholic folk hymnal \"Bury Dreams\", which mutates into a passage of furiously strummed repetition and ghostly drones dubbed \"Resurrection Song\"; \"The Gardener (For Ryan Hildebrand)\" then reestablishes the opening theme but interlaces it with squeaky highpitched frequencies, which dissolve into the mournful, slowpicked melody of \"Her Breath, A Prayer\". As scattershot as all that may read, the piece is unified by the tactility of Chasny's acoustic guitar tones, which never fail to remind you that you're listening to human flesh scraping across steel wires coiled to a piece of wood.RTZ's other movements aren't quite so overwhelming and abrupt in their multisectional maneuvers: \"Warm Earth, Which I've Been Told\" (from a 2003 split CD with Vibracathedral Orchestra and Magic Carpithans) is an accelerated psychrock raga that fades into a deservedly soothing churchorgan hum for a good seven minutes. But the real prize here the is the 2002 Three Lobed Recordings subscriptionCD track \"You Can Always See the Sun\", which forges a blessed union between Chasny's excitable acoustic fingerpicking, electricguitar feedback shards and mantric vocal harmonies, resulting in a slowly swelling set piece that eventually erupts into a surge of Boredomsstyle psychnoise splendor.Comparatively, RTZ's lone previously unreleased work, \"Punish the Chasm With Wings\" an alternating succession of ambient drones and guitar wigouts is far less involving, and serves more as a palatecleanser for the threeact thriller Nightly Trembling (which sports the progasfuck subtitle of \"Redefinition of Being Featuring Creation Aspects Earth, Air, Water\"). The piece's recurring, chanted melody relates closely to the one heard previously in \"Bury Dreams\" from the \"Ressurection\" suite, but here it accrues all the dread of a deathcult procession, with Chasny fashioning a guttural, almost campy, vocal rarely heard from him since. The middle section's chilling, scorchedearth desolation is answered by an equally disturbing third act where Chasny's strangulated vocals and squealing guitar make it sound like he's being burned alive. In one of Nightly Trembling's few discernible lyrics, Chasny is heard to ask, \"Do you know me?\" It's a testament to RTZ's enduringly enigmatic material that, over the course of two hours and six album sides, you're never really sure if you know the answer to that question.
