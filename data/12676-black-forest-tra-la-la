Despite massive turnover amidst its ranks and less than a year removed from Pale Young Gentlemen, what distinguishes Black Forest is the patience of confident survivors, not just of their first tour, but the easy comparisons to more maudlin and forthright old worldinfluenced acts like Beirut.   And it's tough record to initially get a hold of with all of its novel textures like their selftitled, Black Forest begins with a stuttering acoustic riff suggesting hiphop as much as folk, but \"Coal/Ivory\" morphs into something more expansive and majestic, replete with the keenest coal lyric this side of \"Oxford Comma\".  Nearly every track is built off a new string instrument, from the stumbling, thumbed arpeggios that give \"I Wasn't Worried\" a subtle charm to the washedout harp of \"We Will Meet\" to the pizzicato, agreeably bumbling chorus of \"Wedding Guest\". Throughout, Michael Reisenauer's maundering vocals holds the disparate arrangements together like putty, though his lyrics are just shy of scrutability for the most part, overcast invocations of women and wine. The light touch might still be a turnoff to some, since they're occasionally boxed in by their commitment to a sort of pop music that more archaic than Arcadeish. \"The Crook of My Good Arm\" is the most obvious \"rock\" moment, with a vigorous tempo and a cello riff simulating the bass a trick also used by A.C. Newman. More surprising is how the violin jabs of \"Our History\" recall \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and its martial stridency: Reisenauer's cry \"I was like a child/ You can't touch me!\" is more of a wellearned moment of release than a cheap joke. Which is not to call these guys prudes it's a testament to their mastery of subtle suggestion that a line like \"Bodies twist and hips crash/ Kissing thighs in between\" can blend in without triggering a gag reflex.
