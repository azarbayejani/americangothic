{"label":" One Little Indian","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/8856/homepage_large.518e2b76.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stephen M. Deusner","artist":"Twilight Singers","title":"Powder Burns","text":" Powder Burns doesn't reinvent the Twilight Singers' sound, but it's clear that Greg Dulli is searching for new and darker back alleys to walk down. The album resurrects the guitar drama of 2003's Blackberry Belle, and Dulli, as selfassured as ever, continues to draw on specific elements of 1990s altrock the extreme dynamic between verse and chorus, the belief that a soaring chorus is half the message. On these new songs you can hear Dulli pushing himself doggedly to make the music sound larger and more dramatic on \"Underneath the Waves\" and the title track, to hit harder and heavier on \"I'm Ready\" and \"Forty Dollars\", to convey more and mean more on \"Bonnie Brae\" and \"Candy Cane Crawl\", and in general to raise the stakes both musically and thematically to a vertiginous level. Consider \"Forty Dollars\", which could have been at home on his frivolous 2005 solo album Amber Headlights. At one time Dulli might have let a line like, \"Love don't mean a thing, but two a.m. and a telephone ring\" be his final thought, the whole point of the song. But here he caps that thought with a Beatles reference that twists a hippydippy lyric into something seedier and certainly nothing Paul McCartney ever intended. \"Forty Dollars\" perverts \"She Loves You\", \"All You Need Is Love\", and even Cole Porter's \"Love for Sale\" into a sinister menagerie, but Dulli manages to make what amounts to a gigolo comeon sound consequential and human. Granted, Dulli has reasons to push himself on this record; he tries to rise to an enormous occasion. Recording of this album was interrupted by Hurricane Katrina, which spared his studio but slammed his adopted hometown. Equipment had to be run off generators, and four songs were written and recorded during the curfew period immediately after the storm. This fact has been reported many times in the past months and will likely be touted even more in the near future, but that catastrophe has obviously touched and emboldened Dulli, who invites fellow New Orleans transplants Ani DiFranco and Joseph Arthur to join him on some recordings.  More importantly, Katrina and her aftermath have affected his music by altering listeners' perceptions it is, after all, an attractive and persuasive story. It's tempting to hear Powder Burns as a paean to the Big Easy, and the \"you\" Dulli sings in every song could be New Orleans itself, a woman soiled by a terrible storm and an even more dehumanizing aftermath (he's said as much of \"I Wish I Was\" in interviews). Of course, only some songs were written in the storm's aftermath, and it's not difficult to figure out which those are. \"Under the Waves\" and \"I Wish I Was\" sound bigger and ballsier than anything Dulli's recorded in a while, his voice raised dramatically literally screaming above the din.  I don't want to overstate the Katrina effect, if only because very few rock albums could ever live up to such an event of such magnitude. A few of these songs, after all, are several years old and could just as easily have been influenced by the death of Dulli's friend Ted Demme (whose passing inspired Blackberry Belle). Plus, this is no inspirational ode to a city under siege or \"In the Sun\" for that matter. \"Forty Dollars\" and \"My Time (Has Come)\" fit squarely into Dulli's psychosexual canon, and no track here demands any knowledge of its context to convey its point. Just the same, it's difficult to deny the record's heady senses of danger and immense consequence two elements that have been at the core of everything Dulli's done but here sound newly human, gleaned from experience instead of from a record collection or old movies. \"I'm ready to love somebody,\" he sings on \"I'm Ready\", and damned if he doesn't sound like he might really mean it this time.
