In the popular imagination, that might be the case for Peter Bjorn and John three affable Swedish popsters doomed to be forever remembered for one damnably catchy whistle. But such a reading would be to forget that \"Young Folks\", with all its whistling and bongos and Victoria Bergsman verses, came surrounded by an album of other outstanding pop songs. \"Young Folks\" was the tip, but Writer's Block was an iceberg a much bigger, more difficult obstacle for followups to navigate around. Their next proper album, Living Thing (which came following a solo album from singer/guitarist Peter Morén and the instrumental effort Seaside Rock), attempted to skirt such expectations by dramatically shifting the band's sound and mood from the cheerful nostalgia and romantic struggles of Writer's Block to a darker, more embittered outlook; from spring thawing guitars and drums to a more intentionally spare and sharply frozen sound. Gimme Some has been spun as a return to the band's sunnier, more winning sound, but it too often fails to reproduce Writer's Block's unexpected spark. The band seems to acknowledge as much on lead single \"Second Chance\". Over claps and cowbell, Peter Morén coos in his slightly mushy, softly accented voice, \"You can't can't count on the second try/ The second try is such a comedown.\" It may be an apt sentiment, but the song feels intent on proving the point  via its own limpness. By far the most galling thing here, though, is is the cruiseship congaline leading \"Dig a Little Deeper\", with its singsong \"ohoh!\"s and the dull semantic argument of its chorus: \"All art has been contemporary.\" Elsewhere, the album is merely listless. Opener \"Tomorrow Has to Wait\" is a sort of PB&Jbynumbers lope better hidden in the back half of an album. \"Eyes\" has a pleasant, clappy shuffle, and a catchy, Spanishinflected guitar line, trilling and pinched, that dissolves into a fuzzy solo for the song's final minute. These guys are capable musicians and studio heads, and mechanically speaking, these are fine pop songs well crafted, ably produced, everything in its right place but they don't particularly move you. The album's better bits pop up on its second half, after some listeners' interest will have waned. \"Breaker Breaker\" briefly reinvigorates things with upbeat, ramshackle drums, a churning rhythm guitar, and a quick, rising melody on the chorus. \"(Don't Let Them) Cool Off\" begins as garagerock pastiche but opens up into more delicate guitar picking without losing its momentum. \"Down Like Me\" is a fine, downbeat ballad, Morén's voice up in the mix so that you can just hear every gulp and breath before he launches into his selfpitying refrain. And Gimme Some's best song, far and away, is \"Lies\", a highreaching and highscoring number that more than anything here recalls what made PB&J so endearing in the first place. It's just nothing to whistle home about.
