Boston sextet Hallelujah the Hills took the scant text of Lethem's \"Monster Eyes\" (\"Can you feel my eyes abhor you?/ Better run, better run\") and turned it into a somewhat creepy lofi dirge, debuting the completed song at Coolidge Corner Theatre in Brookline, Mass. The collaboration was a fitting first foray into the public eye for HtH, whose debut album Collective Psychosis Begone reveals a group clearly inclined toward the bookish end of the musical spectrum. A verseending lyric from the breathlessly delivered \"fight song\" that doubles as the band's name underscores its academic accent: \"made inventions, broke conventions/ Raised a glass to new pretensions/ metametametaand the novel is dead. Literary existentialism aside, \"HtH\" (the song)'s exuberant horns and strings combine with its referencedesk references to position HtH (the band) in the Venn diagram overlap between the two most currently prominent strains of Angloethnic indie rock. The band's ensemble structure (cello, trumpet, and melodica) and learned lyricism echoes the stagepacking sounds of Arcade Fire, Danielson, Bright Eyes, and Decemberists, while its shambolic, maximalist barroom aura recalls Robert Pollard, another songwriter infrequently at a loss for words. Anyone even slightly familiar with Pollard will recognize his influence on Ryan Walsh's songwriting. The lyric \"let's all plug in to the telepathic disco,\" which feels traced from Pollard's handbook of powerpop processionals, marks a minor crescendo in albumopener \"Sleeper Agent\"; triggering strings to swell, a gang of voices to appear, and temporarily expanding the song into a barroom singalong, perhaps for a pub full of creative writing majors just finished with finals. It gives way to what is easily the album's best song; the irresistable \"Wave Backward to Massachusetts\". Feeling like an excerpt from Alien Lanes or Under the Bushes, Under the Stars, \"Wave\" exhibits Walsh's similar (if not quite as ingratiating) knack for crafting fistpumping anthems from absurdist word clusters. Don't think he's unaware of this, either: on its way toward yet another ravedup, stringladen ending, slowburner \"The House Is All Lit Up\" offers that \"nonsequiturs built this nation.\"  While never again reaching the giddy level of \"Wave\", Collective does tackle a wide variety of subject matter. \"Effie's On the Other Side\" is the most melodic morguerobbing tale you'll hear all year, and the Golden Age ode \"It's All Been Downhill Since the Talkies Started to Sing\" sets a filmstudies fever dream atop fuzzedout guitar. The extended freakout coda sticks around for about two minutes too long; like Pollard and so many college seminar papers, Collective could use an editor in places (the song titles, perhaps, and the overused horns), and at times comes across as a collection of citations without a balance of original vision. As a first draft of Hallelujah the Hills' future potential, however, it's definitely worth a bit of polish.  "}
