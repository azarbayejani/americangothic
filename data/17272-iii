That works in their favor as they face a new and strange set of challenges on their third album: Their brand of dark electro has proven so influential in recent years that it's put them in danger of sounding normal in 2012. Their first two records were explosive, unpredictable, and found them living on borrowed time, trying to outlast the bloghouse fad that spawned their earliest singles and outstrip a run of bad publicity caused by early copyright disputes and cancelled gigs. \"The world is a dystopia where victims don't get justice and corruption prevails,\" Alice Glass recently vented. \"I'm one step away from being a vigilante to protect people and bring justice to the people I love.\" Indeed, her lyrics on the fiercely aggressive (III) take on a newfound importance, often reading like the broken promises of an overworked guardian angel.  Though the duo claims to have overhauled their recording process for (III), trading in all of their gear and disallowing the use of computers in the studio, the album couldn't be mistaken for the work of anyone else. It retains Ethan Kath's trademark staggered synths and Glass' acute wail still pierces through thick reverb. The music now conveys a sense of unease somewhere between waiting for the drugs to kick in and wanting to leave the club as soon as possible. As promised, it is unyieldingly \"bleak.\" Even the catchy songs are filtered through a forbidding darkness. \"Pale Flesh\" exhumes witch house for just long enough to beat it at its own game, \"Sad Eyes\" is pure rave throwback, and the callandresponse hooks that materialize as scrambled vocal transmissions (\"Kerosene\") and longing synth countermelodies (\"Affection\") come off like powerpop played by catatonic automatons. While not as immediately striking as either Crystal Castles (I or II), the streamlined sound allows more maneuverability and subtle variety in the actual songwriting. Crystal Castles songs could once be split into two camps, the \"pretty\" ones and the \"aggressive\" ones; (III) is the duo's most focused record, and the fact that it avoids assaults like \"Doe Deer\" or \"Alice Practice\" demonstrates an alluring confidence. Even the alltexture tracks (\"Telepath\", \"Insulin\") are more driven by rhythm than abrasion; they contribute to the overall flow rather than hijacking it.  Insularity is nothing new for Crystal Castles, as both of their selftitled records existed in a sort of personal airlock. Shortly after the release of Crystal Castles (II), they recast its cover of Platinum Blonde's \"Not in Love\" with Robert Smith on lead vocals, resulting in their most successful single to date, but it had the unintended effect of making the emotional illegibility of their own version more apparent. At the end of the tightly coiled \"Kerosene\", Glass reveals a desire to connect, breathing a promise of equal menace and love: \"I'll protect you from all the things I've seen.\" Glass' lyrics are often addressed to children facing horrors they can't quite process or future atrocities they can't imagine references to blood, wounds, antiseptics, and soil are frequent, as well as a warning to \"sell your bones for ivory.\" So how is this popular, exactly? Fair question. Pop music is often considered to be synonymous with escapism, but it can also be cathartic, and many records this year have shared (III)'s apocalyptic bent. Albums by Swans and Godspeed You! Black Emperor view 2012 in the Mayan sense, predicting a form of divine retribution that will be cataclysmic but also possibly awesome. And while the typical goth jokes came easy when \"Affection\" dropped on Halloween, look at it in the context of being just another day: the New York Marathon planned to go on despite the destruction of Hurricane Sandy, the cover of the latest Sports Illustrated featured a story surveying the \"resilience\" of the Penn State football team a year after the Jerry Sandusky scandal erupted, and we were in the homestretch of an American presidential election that actually fostered the discussion of what constitutes \"legitimate rape.\" Whether you listen to Crystal Castles or not, this is a time of confrontation, conflict, and stress, and the success of (III) is how it brings you close enough to the evil that men do to be shocked, repulsed, and affected by it.
