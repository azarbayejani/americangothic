Sure, these days plenty of lofi acts from Wavves to Dum Dum Girls to Cloud Nothings have left the scuzzy sonics behind, as Pitchfork contributor Martin Douglas recently noted over at Passion of the Weiss. And it definitely works when, say, Smith Westerns embrace swooning Britpop balladry, because those Chicago glambrats' songs already had a certain teendream sweetness to them. But their former tourmates Davila 666 are a different case. You wouldn't hire a bigbudget remixer to scrub the grit out of \"Wild Thing\" or \"Louie Louie\", would you? Like its Nuggetscrushing forebears, this Puerto Rican sixpiece earns a place on your next houseparty playlist with sheer anarchic energy, not to mention a formidable gift for languagetranscending hooks. On Davila 666's underrated 2008 selftitled debut album plus a handful of vinylonly releases for HoZac, Douchemaster, and Rob's House they established themselves as gleefully filthy purveyors of indecipherably catchy garagepop. Thankfully, Tan Bajo doubles down on the group's strengths, delving deeper into screeching sonic chaos while adding an even more memorable batch of songs to shout along with, whether or not you understand the words. That means Davila 666's sophomore album is still rowdy enough for an impromptu weekend binge with a few friends, but it also offers enough carefully crafted tunes and feedbackstreaked textures to fill your headphones. Stylistic tropes from classic 1960s girl groups complement raucous guitar licks on harmonydrenched \"Yo Seria Otro\", with its callandresponse verses and touches of strings, as well as on waltztime \"¡Diablo!\", with its brutally earnest spokenword section. Meanwhile, the VelvetsJAMC scree explored on the earlier \"Ella Dice\" only expands on the hypnotically pounding \"Si Me Vez...\" or the instantearworm advance mp3 \"Esa Nena Nunca Regreso\". When the band breaks into a full Ramones sprint on \"Mala\" or \"Patitas\", anyone with a playgroundlevel knowledge of Spanish can still catch the gist: mierda, caliente, cerveza, cucaracha. That said, at plenty of times Davila 666 continue to delight in their inscrutability, as on the distantly crooned opener or the chocolatejingle hidden track inside jokes, maybe? In any event, such dumb fun is a necessary part of what the trainwhistling, irrepressibly heyheying \"Los Cruces\" reminds us, in a rare Englishlanguage moment, is only \"rock'n'roll.\" "}
