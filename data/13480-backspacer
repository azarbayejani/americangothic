{"label":" Universal / Monkeywrench","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/14507/homepage_large.5161d1c3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Love","artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Backspacer","text":" If you're between the ages of, say, 25 and 35, chances are you either significantly overrate or underrate Pearl Jam. Either you carry a certain nostalgist's sentiment for one of your early rock touchstones (I fall into this camp), or you view them as the root of all that was overwrought and evil about midtolate90s guitar music. Sure, everyone knows PJ sold eleven trillion albums between 1991 and '94, but still I imagine it's difficult for relative young'uns to reconcile how strong an opinion so many people in a specific demographic have about a group that hasn't been commercially or critically relevant for over a decade.Backspacer, the group's ninth studio album, seems to suggest in its tossedoff 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster. Virtually the whole record settles into the same formula the band's been dutifully churning out since the dawn of the millennium lively but almost utterly hookless riffdriven hard rock. Lather, rinse, repeat. And when I say \"riffdriven\" I really mean \"almost entirely riffdependent,\" because musically the riffs themselves are typically the only things worth your attention.PJ's longdormant punk and hardcore proclivities (ugh, \"Lukin\") have been rising to the surface with greater regularity in recent years, and I'll admit in short bursts this bulldozing approach can be somewhat satisfying. The opening four songs kickstart and then keep up a certain pleasing level of propulsiveness, with the goofily fastandloose \"Gonna See My Friend\" (hey, is that an actual bassline I hear?) and Thin Lizzyish double entendres of \"Johnny Guitar\" being particularly listenable. Sooner or later, however, you remember these guys wouldn't know a melody if it bit them in the ass. What's worse, this chugging blitzkrieg negates the power of the band's greatest weapon, Eddie Vedder's voice, which can display its craggy richness and masculine grace only when the band isn't trying to break landspeed records. (I know some folks hate Ed's singing, but it mostly seems like they're reacting to the fact that his voice launched a thousand Nickelbacks, which is like hating \"The Simpsons\" because of \"Family Guy\" or \"American Dad\".)The gentle \"Just Breathe\" might seem like the perfect opportunity for Vedder to finally dust off those resonant pipes, but instead he sings the tune with a distractingly countryish catch in his voice, plus the tune is numbingly syrupy and the lyrics, after a promisingly pointed start (\"I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love\") devolve into tedium. The same hitormiss sensitivity marks \"The End\" Vedder inexplicably finds it necessary to remind us he's \"just a human being\" on one song and \"just another human being\" on the other but at least \"The End\" manages to land on the right side of affecting thanks to its painfully honest depiction of romantic dissolution (\"This is not me/ You see/ Believe/ I'm better than this/ Don't leave\"). Still, we have to rely on \"Amongst the Waves\" to deliver anything remotely resembling the soaring anthemics that used to be a PJ trademark (what I wouldn't give for a \"Light Years\" even). The back half of the album sure isn't inclined to help, largely abandoning even the modest steamrolling enjoyment of the record's initial jolt in favor of thoroughly forgettable midtempo dreck, save for \"Supersonic\", which nonetheless sounds like a band trying to be the Ramones minus the fun.It's an extremely odd thing to say about a band that for three or four years was the biggest rock megalith on the planet, but nowadays Pearl Jam are the very definition of anonymously workmanlike, seemingly plugging along with their heads down from one colorlessly unimaginative album to the next. Once upon a time this was a group that was on top of the world and yet still took all kinds of bizarre chances, recording shit like lengthy tape experiments and songs about bugs often ridiculously selfindulgent, sure, yet always surprising. Now, paradoxically, with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book. "}
