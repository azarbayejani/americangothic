Sometimes it's fast, sometimes it's slow, but it's basically unchanged after 33 years. Its sound is recognizable within seconds. The drums are driving and utilitarian. Guitars run 1950s boogie woogie, 1970s dinosaur rock, threechord punk, and protoheavy metal through cranked stacks. Leading the charge are Lemmy's trademark Rickenbacker bass distorted like a guitar, with everything turned all the way up and his equally gruff vocals. Lemmy's microphone stand is impossibly high, so that he looks like he's singing to the sky. Motörhead's song is an electric missile with a threeminute trajectory.  The song's enduring power is due as much to its message as its sound. Motörhead's themes are drinking, fighting, fucking, and antireligion. (Each album typically features a surprisingly eloquent indictment of Christianity.) Lemmy won't win awards for his lyrics, but they're perfect for his songs. They're blunt, memorable, and the essence of rock'n'roll. Take \"Built for Speed\", from 1986's Orgasmatron: \"I was born with the hammer down/ I was built for speed.\" Or \"America\", from 1982's Iron Fist: \"America, fast cars/ America, the girls, the bars/ America, don't make no fuss/ America, get on the bus.\"  These lines matteroffactly sum up the band's life as road dogs. Motörhead built its name with its classic lineup of Lemmy, guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, and drummer \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor. From 1977 to 1982, this trio made five records that yielded most of Motörhead's hits: \"Ace of Spades\", \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\", \"Overkill\", \"The Chase Is Better Than the Catch\". Since then, Motörhead have essentially reprised these early successes, with slight variations in production values and occasional sonic experiments. (The two major aberrations are 1983's relatively ornate Another Perfect Day, featuring Thin Lizzy's Brian Robertson on guitar, and the unfortunate cock rock of 1992's March ör Die.)  Since Motörhead's output has basically been an excuse for touring, it's best measured against the band's hits. In other words, could new songs fit next to old ones in a live set? By this standard, Motörizer is a success. Like most other Motörhead records, it has a few stonecold classics, some interesting detours, and many iterations of its one song. \"Runaround Man\" is prime Motörhead, exuding braggadocio and a wall of distortion. Having played with Lemmy for over 15 years, guitarist Phil Campbell and drummer Mikkey Dee have undeniable chemistry. \"English Rose\" finds Lemmy oversexed as always (he's said to have bedded thousands of women), with his catchiest chorus since 1991's \"No Voices in the Sky\". \"Buried Alive\" is a barreling barnburner, the kind that's influenced a list of bands as long as this review. (A few examples: Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Darkthrone, Entombed, High on Fire, Doomriders, Disfear, the entire subgenre of crust punk.)  A few surprises pop up on Motörizer. Lemmy waxes pointedly political on \"When the Eagle Screams\": \"Still the young men come with zest and zeal/ I'll tell you why they want to fight and die/ Because the people over them are full of shit and lies.\" \"The Thousand Names of God\" slathers slide guitar atop atypically lockstep metal. \"One Short Life\" is a slow, heavy blues. But otherwise, Motörhead do what they do best: be Motörhead. Motörizer avoids the bland hard rock that larded up some of the band's recent records. Instead, its 11 tracks efficiently clock in at under 39 minutes. Lemmy turns 63 this year, but he still sounds half his age. "}
