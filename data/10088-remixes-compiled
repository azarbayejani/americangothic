{"label":" Hefty","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/9901/homepage_large.dacac620.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Telefon Tel Aviv","title":"Remixes Compiled","text":"  New Orleansborn, Chicagoresiding duo Telefon Tel Aviv introduced their limpid postrock blend of digital blips and organic murmurs on 2001's Fahrenheit Fair Enough. In 2004, second album Map of What Is Effortless took them beyond instrumentals, but their songs didn't always live up to their soundscapes. That shouldn't be a problem on Remixes Compiled, which collects seven years of the duo's work remixing other people's songs and serves as a decent introduction to Telefon Tel Aviv's singular brand of glitchy, melodic chillout music. This is a remixer's remix compilation. Telefon Tel Aviv's remixes are all extensions of a common aesthetic, a fact that's particularly remarkable if you grew up with the idea of these comps as schizophrenic cashins full of your favorite rock group's DJtweaked Bsides. Quickpan beats, twinkling acoustic guitars, and warm synths put the Telefon Tel Aviv stamp on songs by artists as disparate as Nine Inch Nails (a percussive, previously unreleased mix of The Fragile's \"Even Deeper\") and, one track later, Bebel Gilberto (transporting Gilberto's loneliness contemplation \"All Around\" into the lonelier void of outer space). A remake of Oliver Nelson's \"Stolen Moments\" gives the jazzblues classic's melody to a Loyola University Chamber Orchestra subtly beset by computerized dentist drills, memorably combining old and new. A sensitive, Rhodeswashed version of Apparat's lappop anthem \"Komponent\" also carries the Telefon Tel Aviv signature. Still, Remixes Compiled shows only glints of the heightened intensity that occasionally peeked out from the duo's typically more reserved tones on their last album. An exception is the compilation's concluding remix of \"Knock Me Down\" by Hefty label head John Hughes' Slicker project. Here, the electrofunk original's fatherly mantra \"You are my only girl,\" vocalist Khadijah Anwar soothingly proclaims juts out from quiet beginnings into a thorny tangle of distortion and dying synths. A previously unreleased take on American Analog Set's \"The Green Green Grass\" also has a big, noisy chorus and a bit of the vitality of Map of What Is Effortless's quirky \"My Week Beats Your Year\".  Most times, Remixes Compiled is content merely to maintain the duo's restrained cool, whether amid ringing synths and distant horns in a mix of Hughes' \"Got Me Lost/ Driving in LA\", or humanbreath percussion and latenight electric piano on a version of AmmonContact's \"BBQ Plate\". Much as on the albums, the songs don't always live up to the sounds (Nitrada's breathily sung \"Fading Away\" is just one not particularly memorable example). But one hopes this clear view of where Telefon Tel Aviv have been will give the duo inspiration for how to refine their approach still further on albums and remixes yet to come.  "}
