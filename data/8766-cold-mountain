Credit superstar producer TBone Burnett's archivist instincts, or the lunatic collision of an Appalachian folk song and George Clooney's shameless mug either way, O Brother is singlehandedly responsible for tugging the soundtrack out of its premature grave and granting American folk its first truly popular revival.For the Cold Mountain soundtrack, Burnett has burrowed back into his yellowing sack of nuggets and emerged with a fistful of gritty, mid19thcentury classics and longlost Americana. The resulting record combines original orchestral scores, contemporary shapenote singing, covered obscurities, and freshly written songs, all held in place by the commercial superspike of Jack White (and aided by the bignamesongwriter credits of Elvis Costello and Sting).White has always been vaguely preoccupied with his everimportant (if occasionally unclear) tenets of authenticity, and his work on Cold Mountain is an oddly telling mirror to The White Stripes' throwback bluesrock parade. In addition to being recruited for musical toil, White was also cast to portray a traveling Civil Warera troubadour in the film and his contributions to the soundtrack are guised in the exact same kind of otherworldly, hatandbackpack costuming that his bit part openly demanded. No matter whether you credit White's sonic roleplaying to his wider musical agenda (see the Stripes' incessant Delta reappropriation) or just to plain old method acting, Cold Mountain is still a pretty convincing turn: Gone are the wild, fluttering yelps of his Stripes work, replaced by scrappy, talkingblues squeaks and gruff whispers, and his trademark guitar noodling has been mercifully superceded by scraped, tinny strings and perfect bluegrass picking.Performing a handful of traditional cuts and one original, White is ably backed up a dreamteam of dusty country players, including Dirk Powell on banjo, Mike Compton and Norman Blake on mandolin, and Stuart Duncan on fiddle. White opens the record with \"Wayfaring Stranger\", a tortured traveling ballad (previously taken on by Johnny Cash, Sam Bush, Alison Krauss, and Emmylou Harris); while White's homewardbound moans are sometimes disappointingly resigned, the trembling acoustics of his bandmates are more than sufficiently agonized, and \"Wayfaring Stranger\" is as inviting as it is defeated. White's lone original, the sweet and acoustic \"Never Far Away\" also benefits from the kind of soft, dynamic backing that Meg White just can't seem to provide for him (and sees more of Norman Blake's mandolin, with cello by Nancy Blake).White's involvement may be causing the most commotion, but it's the Sacred Harp Singers of Liberty Church that deserve all the tonguewagging attention. Using traditional shapenote harmonies (a trend efficiently documented by Smithsonian brainchild Alan Lomax, and oddly resurrected last year by Portland indiepop quartet The Joggers), the Liberty Church Singers warble in perfect, a cappella fourpart harmony, their collective bellows bouncing up and down between each of the four shapenotes. Meanwhile, the Stingpenned \"You Will Be My Ain True Love\" is impressively voiced by bluegrass matriarch Alison Krauss, although her able pipes do little to transcend the overarranged sappiness of the song itself, which features Sting on backing harmonies and a few too many weeping strings.Krauss' pairing with Elvis Costello, on the Costellowritten \"The Scarlet Tide\", is far less overstated: A pretty (if ultimately benign) piano melody and some subtle cello rub quietly, backing up Krauss' breathy coos. Composer Gabriel Yared also contributes four sweeping, orchestral breezes that pile up on top of each other at the bottom of the record; while appropriate for the film, they're unnecessary and cumbersome on the soundtrack, upsetting the dirty, proletariat posturing of the album's other cuts.While the chances of the Cold Mountain soundtrack matching the success of O Brother are pretty scrawny, it's still an oddly compelling collection, with a small handful of traditional cuts finally getting the wide release they deserve. Far more interesting than a Jack White vanity outlet, the record is an engaging if inconsistent dip into grubby, preradio pop. "}
