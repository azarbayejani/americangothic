{"label":" Warp","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/14733/homepage_large.72ee6d3f.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Bibio","title":"The Apple and the Tooth","text":" After switching up his game on the startlingly good Ambivalence Avenue, Bibio became his own tough act to follow. As if lingering in the moment, he now issues The Apple and the Tooth, which collects remixes of his breakthrough album with four new tracks. They lack the immediate impact of Avenue's highs, because they pull back from wrenched beats into the more familiar territories of folk and psychedelia. They're good tracks, they just grow on you more slowly. They'd have been even better if he'd finished them.The title track is killer, although it sounds more Stones Throw than Warp bounding flute loops, ratcheting percussion, and whizzing guitars shimmy like a bum wheel. It seems like it's building toward something great, but then just ends after a couple of minutes, middevelopment. \"Rotten Rudd\" does the same thing. At least \"Bones & Skulls\", sparkling but thick with incense, feels more like a song than a draft. But then on \"Steal the Lamp\" (lava, one presumes), we're back to the twominute bailout, after glowing scales traced around pittering drums prime us for a drenching psychedelic anthem.The compelling yet skimpy new material feels mostly like an occasion for the remixes, some of which are actually quite worthwhile. Bibio's own retooling of \"Palm of Your Wave\" is arguably more essential than his new productions. The vocal is the same, but there's a new guitar part that snakes like ivy. It's meaningfully transformed, yet still angelically songful. The other successful remixes follow suit. Wax Stag smooths out the jumpy \"Sugarette\" into a dreamy newwave ballad, its vocal accents cunningly wrought into a dainty musicbox lead. Eskmo turns \"Dwrcan\" into a lurching, primordial thing, amplifying a faint oozy quality already latent in it. And Leatherette puts \"Lovers' Carvings\" on ice, using pitchshifted vocal snippets to abstractly sketch its melody.Others squander the rich source material, usually by interpreting \"remix\" as \"molest.\" Clark epitomizes this approach, dousing fragments of \"S'vive\" in his magic powder and reorganizing them into a scattering, tempowarped pulse. He produces some fascinating effects, but it seems more like an expo for his skills than a tribute to Bibio. If Clark goes too far, the Gentlemen Losers don't go far enough they simply strip \"Haikuesque\" almost nude, though it remains very pretty. Detuned squelches have gotten tired by the time Keaver & Brause's \"Fire Ant\" comes around the baggy evocation of horns is kind of neat, but it's more like an extended vamp than a composition.At the nadir, Lone makes \"All the Flowers\" sound abysmal with unattractive detuning and throttling. Why take on a minutelong interstitial, anyway, when no one's touched \"Jealous of Roses\"? The omission of Avenue's most daring, soulful track, and the recruitment of some remixers who represent the murky style Bibio only recently grew out of, make The Apple and the Tooth feel faintly regressive, although you can't read too much into a stopgap like this. The frugality of the new material forestalls the answer as to how Bibio will be able to top Avenue, but it's good enough to keep us asking the question. "}
