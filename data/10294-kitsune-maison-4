Still, it came as a surprise to see this relatively sleepy song chosen to start the newest compilation by Parisbased label Kitsuné, which along with neighbor Ed Banger has played a huge role the past couple of years in expanding the intersection between indie rock and dance music. The best selections on the previous three Kitsuné Maison comps tended to be more muscular: Hot Chip, Klaxons, Simian Mobile Disco...hell, even underrated Swedish synthpopper Jenny Wilson. Darkel's fey, midtempo tune about forever friendship wouldn't be my first pick to get a party started. So maybe it's a declaration of intent. Air can hardly be considered \"dance\", but they were one group both rock fans and electronicmusic obsessives could agree on in the mid to late90s. They got pretty big, scoring Sofia Coppola films and landing whichever TV commercial placements Moby didn't, without sacrificing much critical esteem. Sure, the mid80s PBS vibe of the synths on \"Be My Friend\" does jibe with the analogue nostalgia of some other Kitsuné Maison inclusions. But what the track lacks in dancefloorfriendly beats it may make up for in symbolism. Like: Axes, keyboards, it don't matter. And: This stuff is getting pretty big; Klaxons are on MTV.Kitsuné Maison 4 is another solid collection of previously 12\"only releases that stretch across the indiedance axis. Some of the best cuts will already be familiar to most readers who keep track of this stuff, which it's still tempting to call silly names like \"nu rave\" or \"blog house\". The intoxicated blips and fractured loops of Thieves Like Us' \"Drugs in My Body\" accompany a frail indiedude vocal, appropriate for going out or coming down. Feist's \"My Moon My Man\", remixed here by Boyz Noize but originally from this year's excellent The Reminder, proves pleasantly wellsuited to dry dance beats, robot guest vox, and a jerky bass groove. Adam Sky's remix of \"La Musique\", by Australian dancepoppers Riot in Belgium, adds sleazy electronics to a Frenchlanguage club stomper. Fellow Aussies (and Kitsuné faves) Van She have remixed this track and also Dragonette's \"I Get Around\". The latter appears here in a Midnight Juggernauts mix, with sparkling, filtered synths around Martina Sorbara's digitally tweaked vocals about doing the wrong thing and feeling pretty right.  There are pleasant surprises, too. Rambunctious Toronto duo Crystal Castles take a bewitched, bewitching turn on \"Knights\", which keeps their trademark 8bit squiggles but buries a dolorous vocal in nocturnal distortion. Grimeinformed UK band Hadouken! chat up a girl who's \"fit but fucking boring\" on \"Tuning In (H! ReRub)\", which sounds like the Streets for places with ridiculous cover charges and no jukebox. \"Yes, I've got a nice place/ And I don't mind, we can walk at your pace,\" frontman James Smith spits. The singsong vox and strippeddown groove of Whitey's electrofolk \"Stay on the Outside\" is just a monster Led Zeppelin mashup away from a White Stripes song.  OK, is the Kitsuné aesthetic ready for its media closeup? Yeah, in all likelihood, though perhaps thanks more to Simian Mobile Disco, Klaxons, and Ed Banger's Justice than Kitsuné Maison 4, which still lacks any tracks as instantly godly as those artists' best works. Nevertheless, the latest compilation shows what diverse results this approach may yield, from the guitardriven dancepunk of London band Punks Jump Up's \"Dance to Our Disco\" (closer to Shy Child on the RaptureRadio 4 spectrum) to the rocking, Justicelike electro of Los Angelenos Guns N Bombs on \"Crossover Appeal\". Kelly, watch the charts.  "}
