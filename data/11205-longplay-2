And yet, the first track on Longplay 2 (\"Alarmist\") takes about three minutes to completely fade in from silence. I guess that's just how they roll none of Pacific UV's members will be mistaken for Bradford Cox, at least since the time they faked people into thinking they added two Swedes to their lineup and had a minor controversy about what the actual title of their debut. Longplay 2 comes in a nofrills package that keeps facts and talking points at a minimum, in accordance with the functionality of its title. This could be seen as a risk for a band whose amorphous lineup and droneheavy mien threatens to brand them as more academic than personally approachable. Fortunately for the PortlandbywayofAthens group, it's able to stand on its own regardless of who's propping it up. Due to its rotating cast of vocalists (including guitarist Clay Jordan and Carolyn Berk of Lovers), Longplay 2 feels more like the work of a collective than a \"band\" and more of a collection than an \"album\"; maybe something like a postrock version of Studio's Yearbook 1. \"Alarmist\" and \"Orson\" function as the centerpieces (eight and ten minutes each, respectively), tapping into well thoughtout twinkles like Sigur Ros' () on fewer Ambiens and more Vitamin Water. Which arguably makes things a little lacking in the white magic department, but if that record was your sort of thing to begin with, Longplay 2 will certainly prove every bit as comforting even if they sometimes choose to move icebergs with tugboats. The movements in \"Alarmist\" are slight, but necessary for the illusion of space flotation, while \"Arson\" unhurriedly shimmers towards a choir of chattering electronics. Among others, Pacific UV point to Mazzy Star and Spacemen 3 as influences, which might be the coordinates for Brightblack Morning Light; certainly, \"If So\" and \"Tremolo\" aren't giving off the same moonchild whiff, but they'd still sound fantastic in lunar rovers. In response to a criticism that Pacific UV's melodies were \"derivative,\" former member Lucas Jensen posted on a defunct blog (to paraphrase) \"Well, we only use two chords.\" He's got a point; this sort of thing isn't meant to be nitpicked so much as consumed whole, and a tolerance for a high ratio of delay pedals vs. innovation is reasonable fee for the rewards reaped. \"Waiting\" takes the verse riff of Def Leppard's \"Hysteria\", of all things, and stretches it to infinity over washes of cymbal and a repeated incantation of \"I'm waiting for you to come home.\" It might not sound like much on paper, but your significant other could be running 15 minutes late from work, and \"Waiting\" could make that time feel like an eternity of longing. Longplay 2 glides with such ease that the only real fencesitter is \"Need\", a BRMCevoking battle of fuzz soloing and detached vocals that's either a welcome kick in the pants or a mismatch with the rest of the material. It can't really be both, but in context of such a welcoming security blanket for the winter's thaw, it's merely a loose thread. "}
