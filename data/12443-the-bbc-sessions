{"label":" Matador","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/12955/homepage_large.21aa6455.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Scott Plagenhoef","artist":"Belle And Sebastian","title":"The BBC Sessions","text":" Among the great ironies in Belle & Sebastian's 13year career is that this group, once known for stumbling through its live performances, has become a tight theater band. From the start, they resisted putting on common shows, eschewing pubs or clubs for libraries and churches venues that made their performances atypical and unbound to live clich√©s. Because they performed infrequently in wildly different settings, however, it took time for B&S to hone their live show. The tentative steps charmed some: Writer/musician Franklin Bruno, in an enthusiastic email that was eventually excerpted in the zine Puncture, praised B&S in part for not \"overpreparing\" for their first U.S. show. In a review of the same gig, The New York Times admitted to loving the songs but called the band \"lazy, unambitious bumblers full of private jokes they're too sleepy to share.\"Despite the slapdash nature of some early shows, the group sounded polished on its early radio sessions. It's fitting: Band leader Stuart Murdoch has decried the need to overamplify music at rock shows, and Belle & Sebastian's earlier, baroque lines are better suited to the intimacy of bedroom listening. As a kid weaned in part on John Peel's UK radio show, Murdoch seemed to understand that portion of his audience as well, dedicating one song on an early radio performance to a smalltown girl \"because life isn't easy for a 16yearold in the middle of nowhere.\"It took a while, but Belle & Sebastian eventually performed on Peel's show three times: They cut previously unreleased songs at a session in 2001, added a fivesong set at Peel Acres in 2002, and played a set heavy on holiday music later that same year. The first of these is included on The BBC Sessions in its entirety, alongside 10 of the 13 tracks the group performed for Mark Radcliffe and Steve Lamacq in 1996 and 1997. (A limitededition version of the album adds a 12track live disc recorded in Belfast in 2001, capturing the group in its transitional middle period. Bolstered by additional string players and finding their feet as entertainers, they even frequently performed covers, with \"The Boys Are Back in Town\", \"I'm Waiting for the Man\", and \"Here Comes the Sun\" making appearances on this disc.)The first half of Sessions features faithful renditions of early songs like \"The State I Am In\", \"The Stars of Track and Field\", and \"Judy and the Dream of Horses\". Since the group recorded their first two albums, Tigermilk and If You're Feeling Sinister, in a total of 10 days, it's no surprise that they could replicate the studio tracks but do little more. Even 1997 recordings of \"Slow Graffiti\" and \"Sleep the Clock Around\" each performed more than a year prior to their studio release appear largely as listeners now know and love them.Without guest vocalist Monica Queen, the band is forced to make adjustments to \"Lazy Line Painter Jane\". Guitarist Stevie Jackson replaces her vocals and the arrangement is dialed back, with the song sashaying rather than soaring until an aggressive coda that singlehandedly saves it. Jackson also offers two originals the drab \"Seymour Stein\" and an early version of countrypolitan charmer \"The Wrong Girl\" (here as \"Wrong Love\").This is an incomplete look at these sessions, leaving out a trio of songs recorded in December 1996 which included \"Seeing Other People\", a lovely version of \"This Is Just a Modern Rock Song\", and \"We Rule the School\". The disc also cuts off \"I Could Be Dreaming\" before it gets to its rousing coda. The missing \"Seeing Other People\" is the \"slow version\" the group often played at its earliest shows including that divisive one in New York which featured Murdoch, Jackson, and Isobel Campbell trading verses. Campbell's vocals sound breathless on the radio show, as she displays little vocal control, gasping for air between words and syllables. Despite that, it's still a worthy artifact.More sadly missed is an exquisite reading of \"We Rule the School\", which swaps around some of the lyrics and has a tangible ache to it, even greater than the studio version's. \"I Could Be Dreaming\" drops out Murdoch's closing adlib, wherein he laments tongueincheek that the group signed a record deal rather than continuing to orchestrate their career on their own. Like \"Seeing Other People\", it's perhaps awkward for the group to hear these early gestures, but they're sweet and missed here nonetheless.The final four tracks are also the last songs the group recorded with Campbell, and her vocal ability had grown incredibly over the time. With an already spectral quality to her nowmatured voice, her presence would seem almost ghostly were the first of the four a tribute to the wonderful GoBewteens not already haunted by the subsequent death of that group's cosongwriter Grant McLennan. One of the closest things in the B&S catalog to a Stuart Murdoch solo song, GoBees tribute \"Shoot the Sexual Athlete\" finds him speaking in first person without talking through a character, something he does only when making meta comments on the nature of the group or stardom.On both \"The Magic of a Kind Word\" and \"Nothing in the Silence\", Campbell shares vocals with her bandmates but looms large. The former points the way to the happyclappy sound of Dear Catastrophe Waitress, while the dreamy, drony latter hints at some of the many directions Campbell would take her music once she left Belle & Sebastian. Best of all is \"(My Girl's Got) Miraculous Technique\" which most harks back to the songs B&S recorded in 199697. \"If I could be a song/ I would be something that would snake into your room/ And be with you the whole night long,\" Murdoch and co. sing here, making it a fitting finale for both a radio session and a disc full of them.It's also a fitting epitaph for the group in 2001, just before it was prepared to jump fully into the Technicolor, Trevor Hornled world of Waitress and ditch the coziness and privacy of spinning gorgeous melodies for loners, dreamers, and students. That makes it all the more a shame this collection couldn't find room for \"We Rule the School\" the song dedicated to that 16yearold girl and a few other moments beloved by fans. Childhood and adolescence aren't always pretty there are missteps, embarrassing photos, inept sexual fumblings, and poor choices. It's a slight disappointment that a group so in tune to the awkwardness of youth would paper over some of those moments and leave this set incomplete. "}
