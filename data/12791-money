{"label":" Tomlab","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/13771/homepage_large.21dcb2da.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andrew Gaerig","artist":"Skeletons","title":"Money","text":" Since their Ghostly International debut, Git, Skeletons' outfunk has been getting increasingly muscled, sacrificing seasick idiosyncrasies for unshaved thickness. Money tips the scales further in that direction, presenting the band as aggressive lurkers pumping out distended sexjams. Skeletons' last album, Lucas, came closer to greatness than you might expect of a band devoting a career to glitchbeatgospel. Lucas' longlegged crawls through free jazz and group chants provided a charmingly decrepit counterpart to other fitful, urban creators like the Dirty Projectors.Money is the band's first album for Tomlab and their fifth overall, depending on your definition of album (like fellow New Yorkers Excepter, Skeletons have mastered the art of using the internet as both obscurant and portal to their art). Lead Skeleton Matthew Mehlan seems to have trimmed his small army of contributors to three regulars Jonathan Leland, Tony Lowe, and Jason McMahon all of whom contributed to Lucas as well. And Money continues an ongoing march toward stability, the Skeletons' lineup seemingly solidified and its name Skeletons has come appended with \"and the GirlFaced Boys\" onÂ \"Git\" and \"and the Kings of All Cities\" on Lucas left unchanged. (Should you want to reconvince yourself of the band's wide borders, know that the already illlooking young girl on the album's cover is accompanied in the liners with fullpanel drawings of cupped breasts and vaginal penetration.)Mehlan's always been a little sexbrained see Lucas' \"Fake Tits\" so funk is a natural, heh, bedfellow, but Money seeks that genre's fitful skronk more than its rubbery rhythms. \"The THINGS\" opens with rumbling, moaning brass and sharp, tinny guitars. \"Fill My Pockets Full\" builds a small cacophony out of blasts of citynoise car horns, street chatter and two notes on a nervous piano. \"Dripper\" makes skittish, jazzy runs on an acoustic guitar.Money is a fitting title for the album, and it's worth wondering if Mehlan's been feeling the predictable strains of the consistently creative. His prayers and petitions are eminently practical: \"Fill my pockets full/ My fridge with food to eat,\" he sings. Later, during \"STEPPER (aka Work)\", Mehlan sings, \"I'm gonna get paid enough to survive so I quit complaining for once in my life,\" slurring the \"paid\" as his band carves out a small strut.So Money's most alluring, comehither track \"STEPPER\" is a song about sticking with shit situations, but much of the album feels exclusive and angry in both sound and thought. Mehlan used to be charmingly offbeat, his cityhippie poses weird and welcoming. \"Why would I want to know these things/ The children of rich men know these things,\" Mehlan spits during \"The THINGS\", but that pales in comparison to the prickle Skeletons display during \"Eleven (IT'll RAIN)\", which abandons its popwhimsy opening moments for caterwauling screams before returning to a Latinleaning, hornled coda. \"Unrelentinglessness\" caws slowly, contrary to its title, with Mehlan's nasal whinny sounding like a detriment over the track's untuned nonsense.\"BOOOM! (Money)\" (at least Mehlan has a healthy sense of humor about the green) hurries through wearying, chippy verses before launching seven minutes of quesey jamming in which Skeletons actually sound like they're beating nodable rhythms back with their instruments. Money is full of tracks like this, songs in which Mehlan abandons poetry or eloquence, slumping his shoulders during cluttered, unspoken passages. \"BOOOM!\" is the sour gristle at the center, a brawny, stuffy album that sees Mehlan turn his wideeyed creativity toward big adult messes. Money is no less creative or searching than Skeletons' previous works, but it trades too many of their fantastical charms for scurrying reality. "}
