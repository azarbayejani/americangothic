So, since the notoriously combative Jim and William Reid put aside their family feuding which had initially deepsixed their band back in 1998 to stage a return at Coachella in April 2007, they've done everything short of a new album to keep the Jesus and Mary Chain a relevant, ongoing concern. They contributed their songs and voices to sibling Linda's Sister Vanilla band; they debuted a lone new track, \"All Things Must Pass\" on Letterman only to shunt it off to an episode of \"Heroes\"; and now, they're resorting to a timehonored stalling tactic: releasing a box set, The Power of Negative Thinking, that gathers 81 nonalbum Asides, plus their entire discography of Bsides, demos, and covers.Of course, it could be that the main reason the Reids are holding out on a new JAMC album is that everyone's been doing the work for them their influence continues to permeate the recorded output of NMEapproved buzz bands (the Raveonettes, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club), indie rock iconoclasts (see: the Magnetic Fields' Distortion, Liars' spoton 2007 homage \"Freak Out\"), and up and comers (Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts, A Place to Bury Strangers). It's a most fitting fate for a band that never made a secret out of their own hero worship, but it says a great deal about how adept JAMC were at melding and welding their own obvious influences together that they've become an instantly recognizable reference point in their own right. The Jesus and Mary Chain were a postpunk band in the truest sense of the term, feeding a litany of classic 60s signposts the Beach Boys, Phil Spector, Bob Dylan, the Velvet Underground through punk's rudimentary skill set and noiseterror insolence. They weren't the first band to bastardize the Beach Boys' sunny surf pop, but where the Ramones simply cranked up and sped up the guitar riffs, the Mary Chain took power chords out of the equation altogether, promoting distortion from mere special effect to feature attraction. However, perhaps The Power of Negative Thinking's greatest revelation is that this seemingly primordial sound actually didn't come about naturally: The first track we hear is a 1983 demo, \"Up Too High\", wherein the Reids display an affinity for New Order's immediate postJoy Division output (circa \"Ceremony\"). So when the band's first official single, \"Upside Down\" follows with a radically reoriented aesthetic candycoated melody plus skullsplitting feedback, set to original drummer Bobby Gillespie's tomtom clubbing that would come to define the band's early sound, its appearance here approximates the same outtanowhere effect that the song first had in 1984. But as pure a statement as \"Upside Down\" was, the flipside finds a band still sorting out its influences: as the first entry in what would become a deep catalogue of Bside covers, the gothgarage grind through Syd Barrett's \"Vegetable Man\" marks one of the few times the JAMC pulled from a source that wasn't aligned with the continuum of American cool; perhaps not coincidentally, the track also marks the rare instance where Jim Reid would break out of his deadpan demeanour and truly lose his shit on record.By the time of 1985's debut Psychocandy, the JAMC had struck a singular balance between melody and menace, and the outtakes from the era (taking up the rest of Negative Thinking's first disc) mostly confirm what we already knew: That \"Just Like Honey\", \"Taste of Cindy\", \"Cut Dead\", \"You Trip Me Up\", and so on (all presented here in alternate acoustic arrangements) are no less disarming as pop songs when stripped of Psychocandy's intentionally provocative production. But from a Bside standpoint, the most interesting period for the Jesus and Mary Chain came during the transition from Psychocandy's sinister squall to the more cleanly presented pop tones of 1987's Darklands, wherein the departure of the Primal Screambound Gillespie heralded the Reids' first flirtation with drum machines and sequencers (not all that radical a shift given the early material's reliance on metronomic repetition). In contrast to MTVready singles like \"April Skies\" and \"Happy When It Rains\", the Bsides from this period lean heavily on the Reids' fascination with primitive American rock'n'roll, in the form of both direct covers (a Suicideinspired take on Bo Diddley's \"Who Do You Love\", two punkedup rips through the Beach Boys' \"Surfin' USA\") and, more entertainingly, twisted tribute tracks (\"Kill Surf City\", \"Bo Diddley Is Jesus\") all of which suggest that the Reids treat their idols the same way a gradeschooler treats their first crush: concealing their love with adversarial aggression.PostDarklands, the Mary Chain's albums hewed ever closer to prevailing UK indie trends, from the mechanized synthpop of 1989's Automatic to the protoBritpop guitar rock of 1992's Honey's Dead, before settling into the relaxed countrified groove of 1994's Stoned and Dethroned. Likewise, the accompanying Bsides were less of an outlet for the Reids' extreme impulses (a corrosive cover of Prince's \"Alphabet Street\" notwithstanding) and more a spillover from the albums proper; as such, Negative Thinking's third and fourth discs can either be viewed as a testament to the brothers' consistency or their stubborn refusal to venture outside standard blues scales. The popular singles from this era aren't represented here in any form, but then you don't really miss them because each boasts a reasonable facsimilie: in lieu of \"Head On\" there's the motorik pop of \"Subway\"; instead of \"Reverence\", dig the sinister cover of the 13th Floor Elevators' \"Reverberation (Doubt)\"; while \"Why'd You Want Me\" (from the soundtrack to Encino Man!) plays like a dry run for 1994's Hope Sandoval duet \"Sometimes Always\".With 1998's Munki, the band went out with arguably their most eclectic and gleefully impetuous set since Psychocandy, but castaway tracks like \"Easylife, Easylove\" and \"40,000k\" remained beholden to the Stonesy stonerrock that defined much of their post1990 output. Then again, the Reids sound so comfortable in that mode, and the melodies so easyflowin', it's hard to begrudge them. With these closing selections, Negative Thinking further underscores the irony that the brothers fell out at a time when their music was more traditionally \"together\" than it had ever been.Bsides and rarities collections are by nature geared toward diehard fans, but given that a fair share of this material has already surfaced on previous compilations Barbed Wire Kisses, The Sound of Speed and Hate Rock 'n' Roll, and given the Mary Chain's carefully controlled aesthetic, there are few surprises here for close followers of the band. But then Negative Thinking is not necessarily meant for them: With its handsome hardcover packaging, clearplastic paperstock photo galleries, candid linernote interviews (conducted in early 2007), and ridiculously detailed Pete Framedrawn family tree poster, the set provides a handy opportunity for newbies to play catchup on the band's history and for anyone who first came into contact with the Mary Chain via the closing credits to Lost in Translation, only to be scared off by Psychocandy's torrential noise, the acoustic renditions of that album's best songs thus serve as convenient points of access to the Reids' hopelessly romantic/romantically hopeless worldview.
