{"label":" Emperor Jones","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/4047/homepage_large.fec5ec51.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Dahlen","artist":"The In Out","title":"Il Dito and Other Gestures","text":" On the back cover of the In Out's latest album, these three guys look genuinely bored as they pose in a beatup, postcollege apartment; their record sounds classically lofi, with vocals that could have been taped from a payphone. Even their name is contemptuously, lazily vulgar. That air of cool detachment drives everything that's great about this record: it rocks but doesx92t show off, and it's so direly fashionunconscious that no matter how many jittery rhythms and caustic lyrics they deploy, they're never trendy about their postpunk leanings. Il Dito and Other Gestures (\"il dito\" is Italian for \"the finger\") is the In Out's fourth fulllength; it follows a stretch where the band shrank to a trio, switched labels, played only intermittent local gigs oh, and toured Europe with Sebadoh. But in spite of all the transitions, the new lineup already sounds taut and engrossing. Singer and guitarist Todd Nudelman doesx92t have an immediately striking voice: slightly nasal and not at all powerful, his cool delivery covers a confident, masculine charisma. It may be a cheap shot to compare them to The Fall, but you can hear a likeness in Nudelmax92s implied sneer and indifferently articulate lyrics, criticizing hedonism or commanding us to \\x93auscultate\\x94 him. But he also flashes a sense of humor when he roleplays through \\x93In Pursuit of You\\x94, an almost cheeseball Afghanistan spy drama: \\x93I tried you on the phone/ The lines had all been cut/ By me I forgot!/ It was me!\\x94 shouted while the band feverishly plows ahead. As a guitarist he plays it just as cool, ripping off the occasional solo but mainly locking in with the rhythm section. Bassist Andy Abrahamson and new drummer Eric Boomhower are brutally fast together, from the drilling repetition of \\x93Trapped Body (Auscultate Me)\\x94 to the patter they keep up right under convoluted lyrics like \\x93hedonism haunts our quality time.\\x94 But then they slow down the pace: Abrahamsox92s basslines own several tracks, aiding the casual swagger of \\x93Sense and Withdrawal\\x94 and the mesmerizing, neardroning pace of \\x93The Turning\\x94. He makes guest singer Ilona Virostek sound that much huskier, and he's the foil for Nudelmax92s cool reserve. It can take a few listens to appreciate how wideranging the songs are, skittering through one, then playing glowing keyboards on an old blues cover. Everything hangs together; unlike their hipper contemporaries, the In Out spend more time nailing the material than getting in your face. The band will probably do nothing to promote the album they probably wox92t tour your home town or college campus but this is one of the tightest, freshest, truly Underground releases so far this year.
