They aren't loud and don't need to be their third and best album, Set Yourself on Fire, is a great example of sonic efficiency. Its songs are packed like a Geo Tracker for a crosscountry road trip, yet nothing gets crushed or stuffed or buried. It might be the best orchestral pop album of the past year, only it doesn't sound orchestral, at least not according to the outsize stringandreverb model favored by bands like Oasis or Spiritualized. If you find me a recent album that towers higher with fodder so virtuosically managed and manipulated, I'll give you 20 dollars and jump in a foreboding body of water from a height. It took me two months to plow through Heart, Stars' 2003 sophomore effort. Two songs, \"What the Snowman Learned About Love\" and \"Elevator Love Letter\", sailed so high above the rest, I demurred at the possibility of imperfection. The album relied on standout riffs and jags of cathexis; it was, in essence, a collection of rifftastic oneliners, and oneliners sometimes fall face first. Set Yourself on Fire is more fullbodied; nothing is so singular it isn't worth fleshing out or adding to, which bolsters the weaker songs without watering down the cream. The album opens with a disquieting epigram: \"When there's nothing left to burn, you must set yourself on fire.\" A procession of lugubrious strings gives \"Your ExLover Is Dead\" the hugely premonitory feel of Heart opener \"What the Snowman Learned About Love\" without its flimsy grandiloquence. Amy Millan may whisper the refrain, \"live through this and you won't look back,\" but the song is no chore; in fact, it's an apt segue into the astonishing title track. \"Set Yourself on Fire\" takes Millan's mandate and soars with it. A lores synth arpeggio carries the song alongside a propulsive drumbeat and cascading strings. The song performs a nimble time change in its bridge before staking a final salvo \"20 years asleep before we sleep... forever\" over an icy coda. You might hear it on a Peter Pan bus, north of New Haven all industrial barrens, sunny cold midDecember afternoon after leaving your girlfriend, and you might cry. The subsequent two tracks defibrillate the heartbroken. \"Ageless Beauty\" will sell Arts & Crafts' first ringtone, just watch. Its simple changes are dusted with zippy auxiliary lines playing peekaboo. \"Reunion\"'s chorus is so bathetic it's entrancing: \"All I want is one more chance,\" sings Torquil Campbell, \"to be young and wild and free.\" Rather than a second refrain, they give us a spry guitar lick that could make its chorus and secede if it wished. Set Yourself on Fire is about breaking up and breaking down, and as such the album feels wontedly cathartic, like the moments right after you hit your emotional nadir and start getting your shit together. Stars handle the mood delicately with few slipups; my only complaint is that they never handle much of anything else. Save \"The Big Fight\" which is tame, slow and loungedout there's no controversy, only halfsmiles and the soggy aftermath. But even the dearest numbers have faint, nagging undercurrents. The band make no effort to avoid the inevitable charges of oversentimentality; in fact, they indulge the calls: \"The cold is a vindictive bride,\" reads their website bio, \"she'll trap you between her thighs and turn your heart to ice if you're not careful.\" Despite overblown romanticism run rampant, Stars somehow remain understated. It's the \"Soft Revolution\", as the terrific penultimate track declaims. Hop aboard.Â  "}
