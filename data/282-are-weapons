Weapons","text":" It is the power of cash that compels you. The mindless, sloganeering choruses of their drum machine ditties approximate a junior varsity Andrew WK cover band, and their headbanger junkie image real or not is laughed offstage during an opening slot for the fucking Pet Shop Boys. A.R.E. Weapons fire blanks and laugh when people flinch, but it's a risky proposition planning a bank job with replicas. Well, I'm no rentacop: this pistol's loaded with the cold truth, and A.R.E. Weapons aren't getting a dime.\"Dude!/ That's cool!/ Life was meant to be awesome!\" Yeah, if you're born rich enough to pretend you're poor. Like most poseurs, this trio of Nolita fashionistas fails to understand that most poor people try to look their best. Contrary to the dalliances of the rich who've lately been slumming it like it's 1979 there's nothing fun or \"cool\" in wondering when you'll eat next. If there's any justice, every truckercapped hairmetal ironist in New York will find out, and soon. A.R.E. Weapons wouldn't exist if it weren't for DJ/manager (and now \"official\" band member) Paul Sevigny's PDA full of contacts. After releasing a pair of cutely stupid EPs the year before, the band was being called \"a guilty pleasure\" by NYC chicbarometer Vice Magazine by February 2002. That month, they faced a demanding audience for the first time, opening for the Pet Shop Boys during NME's Carling festival. In the pantheon of concerts I wish I could timetravel back to see, this bumps up next to Public Image Limited's '81 riot at the Ritz. Nothing so dramatic happened, but watching an audience that remembers the genius multimedia thrash of Pop Will Eat Itself yawn while unconvincing, talentless dickheads try to intimidate them with lines like, \"Fuck you pay me,\" that's my idea of heaven. It can't hurt that Sevigny's sister's been pushing the Christiane F. look in the UK trades complete with open sores but it's not Chloe's fault that it took her 30 yearold brother this long to figure out that it's easier to make it in music than movies. Kicking around New York for fucking ever, Paul's finally put together a scam that's paying off: holding down three keys on an old Casio. His sister slipped thenboyfriend Jarvis Cocker a copy of their tape last year, and voila: they were on Rough Trade. A.R.E. You Fucking Kidding Me? Of course the hobnobbing and scenester privilege could be forgiven if A.R.E. Weapons had a shred of talent or originality, but at best, this record is Suicide resurrected as a novelty act; at worst it could pass for an extreme deodorant commercial with swearing. \"Strange Dust\" is a sluggish hiphop rip with rhymes so uninspired, Mark Wahlberg would disown them (although... compare A.R.E.'s \"guess I shouldna shouldna smoked that\" with Marky Mark's \"Washed up dreams, shattered pride, all because Annie took a hit on the wild side\"); their selfhype anthem \"A.R.E.\" is a Sega Genesis blasting Ministry's \"Jesus Built My Hotrod\", and the closer \"Hey World\" drawls Desaparecidos lyrics (\"she's 14 and livin' in a world of shit!!\") that can safely lay claim to being the album's nightmarish best, if only because a few suburban kids might actually relate to its cardboardcutout rebellion.\"People talk shit/ People talk trash/ When people talk about me/ I just have to laugh.\" Naturally. Soulless pretenders always find solace in that old famewhore copout \"there's no such thing as bad press.\" That might be true, but there's definitely bad music, and you can't laugh an album this impotent and ignorantly indulgent off your face. Aside from the tolerably punchy \"Bad News\", A.R.E. Weapons only made me lament the unrecognized prescience of This Is the Day... This Is the Hour... This Is This! Fuck A.R.E. Weapons, pay PWEI. "}
