{"label":" Pangaea","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/1808/homepage_large.ee3d4e2c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"Capillary Action","title":"Fragments","text":" I think at this point we've established that reasonable guitar solos are okay again, and that all of punk's moping about displays of virtuosity was just depriving us of one of the best parts of the song. After all, the fear of rocking out is a pretty silly phobia. It would be an exaggeration to say that Capillary Action's debut Fragments is all about guitar solos (there are piano and keyboard solos, too), but virtuosity and rocking out are both very much in the cards. Before discussing any of that, though, I'd like to address the drunken samba \"A Hundred Pages of Cannot Be Named\" that sits in the middle of the album, next to a jazz piano thing called \"Scattered Remnants\". These two tracks form the quiet but still jittery core of a record that generally feeds on adrenaline, and they're a necessary respite amidst tracks like the spasmodic and pretty aptly titled \"MidCoital Seizure\", which sounds a little like three Need New Body songs fighting. Instrumental rock can be a dead zone or a playground, and guitarist/core member Jonathan Pfeffer is determined to make Fragments the latter, dragging noise from his Fender one minute and layering intricate little thickets of arpeggiated rhythm the next. The second and penultimate tracks on the album, \"Ticking Ghosts, pt. 2\" and \"Architecture Would Fail\", flirt with that dirty hyphenate progmetal; the first taking it straight on with pummeling guitar/drum stutters and harmonized leads, while \"Architecture\" cuts passages of fretboard fireworks with jarring interjections of brutal noiserock and foreheadcrushing kickdrum. The best track is opener \"Ticking Ghosts, pt. 1\", which splits the difference between Pfeffer's spacier and harderrocking tendencies, riding a swaying 6/8 groove through passages that alternately chime and squall.Fragments is a nifty guitar record that plays well with different moods and feels, making for a cohesive whole that flows from track to track in an almost suitelike fashion. It's an assured debut, and Pfeffer is a clearly talented musician who bears watching to see where he'll take his craft. "}
