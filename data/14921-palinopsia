{"label":" Hippos in Tanks","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16012/homepage_large.35a43d05.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"d'Eon","title":"Palinopsia","text":" Montreal producer/singer/composer D'eon started making synthesizer music when he was four years old, continuing through years of formal music training before dropping his studies entirely as a teenager. He developed acute forms of anxiety and agoraphobia, which he worked out, then went to the Himalayas to study Tibetan music, living in a monastery and not speaking for months. Since then, he's integrated himself within the burgeoning underground experimental scene; Daniel Lopatin, aka synthdrone alchemist Oneohtrix Point Never, even brought him and his music to ofthemoment label Hippos in Tanks.D'eon's personal history and line of study are relatively fascinating; I wish that personal experience would've informed the music on his debut LP, Palinopsia, just a bit more. There's some ephemeral flourishes of Eastern music figures here and there, but the record feels more like a collection of wellexecuted genre exercises than anything else. \"Wellexecuted\" is the key adjective, though; untangle the hypnotic knot of synths underneath \"2040\" and you'll find the backing track for a lost 1980s electropop cut. \"What We Want to Be\" is a straightforward slice of euphoric piano house, while \"Keep the Faith\" falls in line with the latest fashion of embracing mainstream R&B signifiers. However, the most noteworthy contemporaries in that line of sound (How to Dress Well, Autre Ne Veut) have applied their own skewed vision to that particular genre; here, D'eon basically plays it straight. He does a good job across the board here, but you might be left a little wanting for something more chewy to sink your teeth into.The other main issue with Palinopsia is D'eon's voice: Not specifically how he sings, which ranges from a meditative croon to a histrionic whine without much room for accessibility in between, but what he's saying. There's a vaguely sociopolitical vibe to D'eon's music, and its somewhat messagemuddled application doesn't always ad  d up. The electronic epilepsy of \"Kill a Man With a Joystick in Your Hand\" does well to convey heatstroked modern combat in foreign lands, but it's not easy to scan his intent when he sings, \"Everybody want to fuck with the Taliban/ All the way from Kabul to Pakistan\". Conversations in college common rooms are unintentionally evoked in \"Keep the Faith\" (\"Why don't you stay with me a little while/ And talk about the things we do to survive\"), while the record's ideological nadir, \"Recession Proof ($40 Paycheque)\" goes from complaining about (you guessed it) a $40 paycheck to, uh, this: \"The ocean is a sewer/ The city is a whore/ Money in the toilet/ Oil on the shore.\" The imagery is serviceable but clich√©d; like the most welltread parts of Palinopsia, it could use a fresh twist.
