Like Athens' Pylon before them, allgrrl Atlanta quartet the Coathangers are making sure the revolution will not be such a drag. On a rough 'n' rowdy selftitled 2007 debut via local label Rob's House Records, they swapped \"Suck My Left One\" for \"Nestle in My Boobies\", \"Oh Bondage, Up Yours!\" for \"Shut the Fuck Up\", hating Margaret Thatcher for sympathizing with \"Tonya Harding\". Word is their ramshackle live shows alongside the likes of Deerhunter, Black Lips, Jay Reatard, and, next month, Calvin Johnson have included loogies and My Little Pony.Â  Cue the premature backlash. The Coathangers keep the backalley postpunk party going strong on a scratchy, shrieky, foulmouthed sophomore album, Scramble, their first for Seattlebased Suicide Squeeze. The callandresponse vocals split between guitarist Julia Kugel, drummer Stephanie Luke, keyboard player Candice Jones, and Meredith Franco on bass are shrill. The politics aren't, even though technically everything from their beyond Fucked Up name to their overall fuckyou we'renottheDonnas stance is kind of political. Nope, the Coathangers aren't ones to let good intentions stand in for a good time. As with fellow Georgians the B52s, their best songs play like shouldbe novelty hits. The Coathanger with the chirpy Snow White voice sings lead on a couple of the catchiest, including upstairsneighbor rant \"Stop Stomp Stompin'\" and unrequitedloveatfirstsight song \"143\", both of which have enough quotidian sloganeering and goofybuttrue detail for UK shouters Art Brut. Pretty sure it's the same band member who threatens to break our \"fucking face\" on caterwauling garagerocker \"Gettin' Mad and Pumpin' Iron\", too. But the Coathangers can also drop the tempo slow dancing with a dude who \"ain't no sissy\" on \"Dreamboat\", or missing a boy from outer space on keyboarddriven \"Sonic You\". There's even one for the olds: \"Arthritis Sux\". There's even one for tUneYarDs: sloppy soundeffect collage \"Bobby Knows Best\". Put together enough novelty hits, and you have a pretty solid album. If offkilter percussion can't quite overcome the whispery false ending on \"Pussywillow\", or \"Time Passing\" gets a little lost up its own indecipherable scifi squall, there's always the scuzzy pink frost of \"Toomerhead\" (he ain't an asshole, he's just sick), or the getoffmyback hoarseness of \"Bury Me\". Particularly given the neanderthal sexual politics of much of the current indie music scene looking at you, Brooklyn Vegan comments section it's good politics when a girl group can declare, as a deepervoiced Coathanger does on \"Cheap Cheap\", \"You can just go fuck yourself.\" It's good entertainment when they can make us pretend they're not talking to us and that's probably smarter politics, too. As the Long Blondes once sang, you could have both. "}
