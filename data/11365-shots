{"label":" Jagjaguwar","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/11138/homepage_large.e192f25b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andrew Gaerig","artist":"Ladyhawk","title":"Shots","text":"  \"I Don't Always Know What You're Saying\", the first track on Ladyhawk's sophomore album, Shots, opens with a potbanging guitar riff and a cascading, swooping noise whose origins effected guitar? synth? are indeterminate. Fitting with its title, the song offers what are possibly the only moments of uncertainty, sonically or emotionally, on the entire album. Shots, befitting Ladyhawk's reputation, is nofrills guitar rock that takes clear stances on relationships (confusing!) and guitars (good!). Still, it's hard to put the Vancouver quartet in a box: Ladyhawk look the part of brawny Americana rock revivalists, but at no point does Shots fulfill even the most liberal stylistic requirements of folk or blues or country. There's too much jaunt and bounce for proper hard rock; powerpop might work if the whole thing weren't so…turgid. Grunge and, make no mistake, not \"neogrunge\" nor \"postgrunge\" nor \"ironicgrunge\" probably best encapsulates the band's overarching sortofness. Talking about what Ladyhawk are is a lot less interesting that discussing what holds them back: namely, their proclivity for Paul Bunyanbig, capitalR rock moments, with solos and crashing cymbals and howled vocals, or, more specifically, their need to tether those moments to their slowest and clumsiest songcraft. Shots opens with a trio of poprockers of such propulsion and grit that bestcasescenario thoughts start popping up: holy hell Ladyhawk might be Sugar! At their best, Ladyhawk share Sugar's penchant for crafting hooks around vanilla sentiment; that \"Fear\"'s chorus is inescapable hardly lends any extra weight to frontman Duffy Driediger's refrain, \"I just wanna feel something other than fear/ I don't wanna go back but I can't stay here.\" The unfortunately brief \"S.T.H.D.\" might've been a sneak preview of the new Wolf Parade album but Driediger never lets the melody jerk out of his jaw, so it stays the best two minutes of 1980s punk Ladyhawk have ever put to tape. This familiarity, weirdly enough, breeds excitement: we know Ladyhawk are not new, but they might yet be a welcome brand of old. After the surprising opening salvo, however, Shots clumsily bogs down in its desire to be big and rocking, even though any time Ladyhawk can be bothered to push the tempo the latter moments of \"(I'll Be Your) Ashtray\", the once again too short \"You Ran\" they gnash and spit gloriously. As for the rest of it: no thanks on the yawny \"Corpse Paint\" and the woebegone lyricism of \"Faces of Death\" (\"There's no such thing as endless love/ Only a joke told in very poor taste/ That somehow keeps cracking me up\"). Driediger has an unfortunate knack for these blocky, teenage phrases; the big poetic moment of \"Ashtray\" goes as follows: \"I'll be your ashtray/ If you need me/ ‘Cause I only wanna feel you burnin'.\" Then there's closer \"Ghost Blues\", functionally no different from any other Ladyhawk song save for the fact that it is 10 minutes long and features a handful of guitar solos. Ladyhawk's not the first band to backload an album with an epic or two, but \"Ghost Blues\"' random appointment as such leads to the uncomfortable notion that by me having written this review and you having read it, we have both thought harder about Ladyhawk's art than Ladyhawk.  Perhaps Shots needs to be interpreted not as violent outbursts but rather as uncertain scatter: attempts. Ladyhawk aim squarely for the middle– at least the middle of muscular guitar rock– but they find plenty of potholes to make the ride seem bumpy. Shots is like any stretch of pocked road, though: the smoothest stretches are the shortest.  "}
