The list of veterans with twodecade careers who aren't reiterating old formulas is even shorter. The Revenue Retrievin' series doesn't just cement E40's legacy, it extends it. With four fulllength LPs released in just under 12 months, the records are less a set of distinct statements than a data dump. It's several hundred megabytes of diverse and wideranging music whose sense of purpose is proportionate to its overwhelming size. The two most recent additions to E40's creative renaissance, Overtime Shift and Graveyard Shift, are only vaguely conceptual. Instead, the idea seems to be for E40 to create a panoramic view of street rap from as many narrative angles as possible. The entire project suggests a profound level of confidence from E40. Although there are tracks that seem like potential minor hits or have unique pop sensibilities, the trendchasing days of 40's career appear to be over. Even TPain feature \"Serious\" seems more like a sincere attempt to highlight the singer's strengths, rather than a toolate bone thrown to a chartrap audience. These are exceptionally balanced records, moving swiftly through a huge variety of production tics and songwriting styles. The meat comes courtesy of producer 40's son DroopE, who has transformed the sound of hyphy's brief geographicallylinked moment into E40's personal house production style. But just when it seems like posthyphy minimal bangers start to dominate, the acoustic bassdriven \"43\" switches gears into noirish atmosphere. Or \"My Money Straight\" arrives, a revival of the classic Bay area mob music sound with an invigorating verse from RBL Posse member Black C. Most of the guests here come from the Bay area; rapper Beeda Weeda has a particularly impressive moment on \"In the Morning\", and rising star DB Tha General stands out on the striking \"Streets Don't Love Nobody\". When it comes to guests from outside the Bay, Bun B and Slim Thug's generically titled \"That Candy Paint\" is redeemed by euphoric production. \"Lookin Back\", which features Devin the Dude, is a nostalgic look at both rappers' transformations from struggling artists to successful career rappers. \"Fried\" features Tech N9ne, one of rap's more underrecognized grassroots success stories. For the most part, the guests seem chosen for their musical chemistry rather than any illusions about getting national club or pop radio play. But E40 remains the star, and no matter how consistent the songwriting is, it's his rapping that makes this record work. He sketches memorable characters, like \"My Lil Grimey Nigga\", the stickup kid who was dropped on his head as a child, or the old excon who surprises two young hardheads on \"Streets Don't Love Nobody\" (\"Never know who heavyduty in the streets pushing weight.\") Many of the tracks here are archetypal street rap; \"I Love My Momma\" might seem like a hiphop clich√© at first glance. But E40's lyrics are full of livedin lyrical details and humorous asides that give his tracks a human touch, like his mother's \"famous banananut bread and 7Up cake.\" On the flip, \"Trapped\" is one of the most devastating tracks, a song that seems especially potent considering the state of America's prison industrial complex: \"I feel bad because all I've got is advice/ And I ain't got nothing to show for it, I'm in here for life.\" Although street rap doesn't have the media profile it once had, the Revenue Retrievin' series argues for the continued relevance of rap music speaking to and from America's underclass.
