{"label":" PrettyBeat","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/11382/homepage_large.0cdc3133.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Love","artist":"Kid Static","title":"In the Meantime","text":" Hiphop, the internet and indie culture: They're arguably the linchpins of independent rapper Kid Static's artistic identity, and yet he dedicates at least one song apiece on his second solo album to ripping each a new one. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. Yes, empty gestures and idiocy abound, so it makes sense that a smart guy like Static would call bullshit. Still, there's a danger in getting boxed in by sheer negation, and for the overwhelming majority of In the Meantime, the Chicago emcee sounds like nothing so much as a man without a home.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Static is particularly fond of the kind of buzzing, metallic beats that instantly signify a grouchily dystopian outlook to anyone who's ever owned a Def Jux record. Almost everything on this halfhour platter proper songs and periodic instrumental interludes leers with disjointed rhythms and spare clatter. There's even a track of eggheaded sociological pedantry, \"Of Prophets and People\", from a dude who already sounds a good bit like Mr. Lif anyway complete with herkyjerky subAutechre beat work!Fortunately, most of Static's lyrical artistry is reserved for pure misanthropy, and if rappers, bloggers, and hipsters need someone (else) to write a version of \"Radio, Radio\" just for them, he's certainly not a bad man for the job. \"Internet Superstar\" is a relatively predictable but still spoton piece of musical pwnage, earning points for castigating the chickenshit racism of the modernday message board and, admittedly, making nice with a requisite lolcat reference as well. More strangely and memorably, the succeeding \"Man Up\" finds Static aiming his ire at indie dudes who wear women's jeans, expressing stupefied disdain at the concept of \"Cutting off blood to your package/ Just to get some action.\" And lest it be said that Static's only conveys contempt for the subcultural habits of white people and isn't an agent for change, there's the helpfully individualized \"Hates on a Plane\", a wicked little narrative wherein our hero serves up rough sexual justice to a belligerent fellow airways traveler. Erring on the truly funny side of mean with lines like \"You got on tight pants but one titty's bigger than the other,\" Static proves himself a worthy contemporary of downtoearth, grownman shittalkers like Murs and Rhymefest.Like those rappers, he'll probably be underrated largely because he occupies an uneasy middle ground in the hiphop landscape, failing to exhibit enough of the righteous piety expected of the underground's saviors while lacking the pop appeal to cross over. Perhaps this reality has something to do with why Kid Static is most complicatedly aggrieved over hiphop itself. Wasting no time on \"Rappin N Shit\" in claiming \"I don't battle,\" Static proceeds to state that \"if you're the emperor of this rap shit then I'm Brutus,\" before very deftly poking fun at hiphop's nagging selfreflexive tendencies with the refrain \"Picture me rappin' about rappin' 'n shit.\" \"I Identify\" threatens at first to be another acid bath with its opening aside of \"stereotypical yo\" followed by Static's mocking boast that \"Everything's a freestyle/ I got bitches.\"Then a funny thing happens, and just before the end of this 30minute pisstake Static actually opens up a little bit about \"growing up in Illinois,\" and even in the midst of a groaning joke about Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes finds cause to confess \"This rap shit is the best trip.\" Hopefully this fleeting moment of positivity won't prove to be too contagious Static has potential to be just the kind of selfaware cynic a frequently overreverential art form like hiphop always needs.
