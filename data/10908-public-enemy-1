For example: Famed NYC DJ Funkmaster Flex's wife apparently answers to Mrs. Funkmaster Flex. Also, Cam is skeptical of the internet rumors that have surfaced over the last few months (\"Next time y'all doin' a movie, just send me my script...I promise I'll play my part a little better\"). He still has love for onetime cohort Jim Jones, but he claims \"ain't nothing lasting forever\" (doublenegative trickery?). Also of note, the MC claims the NYPD heavily relies on YouTube to keep track of meaningless hiphop beefs. FYI: Cam occasionally flies commercial (\"I flew commercial\"). And his mom was sick this summer (\"I had a family emergency that took a few months of my time\"). The opening tirade is like a gushing, postvacation LiveJournal entry aimed at an anonymous commenter who bitched about a lack of updates. It's stupefyingly specific, silly, and, within the insular snowglobe that is Dipset, it makes perfect sense. Cam'ron is a drama queen; on his career pinnacle, Purple Haze, he spun explicit ghetto yarns on a song called \"Soap Opera\" and aired out a particularly pottymouthed phone conversation with an acquaintance on a skit called \"I'm a Chicken Head\". And, though he's now a grizzled vet past his commercial prime, he still has a nagging need to set records (as well as possibly homoerotic utterances) straight. Last year's Killa Season turned his obsession with getting even into an annoyingly blaring cacophony filled with notsooriginal threats and boasts. (The accompanying DIY film was a twohour embarrassment that made Streets Is Watching look like The Godfather). Gone were the cucumbersmooth flights of fancy and cozy popsoul beats that made Haze so endlessly repeatable, replaced with the hysterical insecurities of a man losing ground not only within hiphop but within his own crew. But, with Public Enemy, Cam is coming to peace with the fact that two of the rappers he nurtured to stardom Juelz Santana and Jim Jones have largely eclipsed him in the public eye. He's still peeved about bitchy Nah Right commenters, but he's not taking blatant and misguided shots at JayZ or 50 Cent anymore. And, thankfully, Cam's occasionally infantileyetcharming soft side is back, with some MF Doomstyle plastic r&b instrumentals to boot. Yet, this is still a mixtape, and while its MySpace/mailinglistscam distribution system may be forward thinking, Public Enemy suffers from traditional mixtape trappings: toolong skits, too many underlings and just too much all around. iTunes tells me the tape boasts 2.1 hours of audio at least it's easy to tell what to keep and what to send recycling into hard drive hell (click below to listen to a Pitchforkapproved abridged version).  The doublealbum's first eight tracks are startlingly stellar. \"Why They\" is a throwback to the RocAFellaera. With its Just Blazestyle highpitched pulse, the track is reminiscent of the woefully underrated posse album Diplomatic Immunity. The song doesn't berate, it swaggers. And Cam reels off some finely tuned Dipisms that casually conflate snack time with grind time: \"I'm the cookie monster/ Yeah, Chips Ahoy!\" The cartoon gospel of \"Calm Down\", meanwhile, recalls Haze's \"Harlem Streets\", with Cam channeling Martin Lawrence's stressedout Bad Boys cop as he decompresses with trademark sameword rhymes like, \"Strip club in the crib, not just the pole/ Lights flash, mirrors up, disco ball and I disco ball.\" \"Just Us\" manages to make shitty sex sound downright sweet and the selfeffacing \"Hot Mess\" has Cam coining his best nickname in ages (\"Young 60 Minutes\", in reference to his infamous \"stop snitching\" interview on the show) and more or less admitting to his Apple fetish (\"Fiends slept in front of my crib for two days straight like I had the iPhone\"). After the disgusting skit about bugs in food, though, things get choppier.  Without Juelz or Jim, Cam recruits a couple fresh Dippers called Tom Gist (yes, that's his government name) and Penz to take their place. Safe to say, this switch marks a downgrade on all accounts. Gist handles most of the album's \"miserable urban living\" parables with dour tracks like \"Kill My Dog\" and \"Think Out Loud\", it sounds like the guy's biggest inspirations are Master P's \"I Miss My Homies\" and the movie Crash. Penz pumps out mechanized responses based on welltrodden mixtape themes. To emphasize his \"versatility,\" the rapper/droid shows both his yin and yang on successive tracks called \"Penz Sad\" and \"Killa Penz\" near the end of the tape. (Could an Encino Manstyle Dipset movie dubbed Penz Sad be that far away?) The new additions are good news for previous Dipset Clisters like 40 Cal and Hell Rell, who move up to the Blist by default and, by contrast or not, sound better than before 40's verse on \"Troublemakers\" is nearly Camworthy as it peaks with the haterbaiting line: \"They baby moms' made me they screen saver.\"  Clearly, Cam is still out of his skull. No other rapper could or would make a sincere YouTube threat in their boxers or produce hilariously fauxverite \"Where's Waldo\"style clips to promote their free mixtape. Public Enemy finds the Harlem native cooling out and giving up his quest to best today's commercial rap behemoths. He's even growing up a little. On the gorgeous slow jam \"Let Me Know\", he admits, \"the sex is great but trust is the issue,\" and even leaves the possibility of rejection wide open: \"If not tonight, text me though and let me...know.\" At long last, another Cam'ron soap opera worth following.
