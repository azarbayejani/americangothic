While Knox occasionally ventured outside his native land, the charismatic/confrontational Enemy/Toy Love/Tall Dwarfs frontman and solo act spent most of his life home supporting New Zealand's productive arts scene, paving the way for such acts as the Clean, the Chills, and the Verlaines. Along the way Knox amassed more than his share of fans around the world, too, and when news spread that he suffered a stroke last summer, support and sympathy arrived in equal measure to his stature.Still, that doesn't quite prepare you for the quantity and quality of Alist acts that appear on Merge's Stroke: Songs for Chris Knox, a 2xCD tribute to the man and his music whose proceeds will go toward his recovery (Knox, 57, currently has limited speech and mobility). (Preorders are currently being accepted, and the record is out now digitally.) The sheer breadth and diversity of this recorded response almost begs disbelief, considering how quickly it came together, and really shows how far Knox's influence has reached, from several of his Kiwi peers to kindred spirits. The already much missed Jay Reatard starts off the set wellpaired with the Toy Love nugget \"Pull Down the Shades\", \"recorded in the bathroom of a hotel in Denmark on a 4track,\" and the just plain missing Jeff Mangum, whose cover of the Tall Dwarfs' \"Sign the Dotted Line\" marks a rare recorded reappearance of the Neutral Milk Hotel mastermind, whose own lofi inclinations lined up well with Knox's.Incredibly, the presence of Mangum is just the tip of the iceberg. The cavalcade of highprofile support continues with Bill Callahan and Will Oldham, whose versions of \"Lapse\" and a stunning \"My Only Friend\", respectively, remind that Knox could be as moving as theatrically manic. Stephin Merritt (who enlisted Knox to close the first 6ths album) simultaneously pays homage to Knox's aesthetic while reminding us of his own home recording roots with his (allegedly circa 1983!) version of \"Beauty\". Yo La Tengo mellow out \"Coloured\" and Lambchop offer a faithfully pianoled ren  dition of \"What Goes Up\". Elsewhere AC Newman's \"Dunno Much About Life But I Know How to Breathe\" channels Knox's trademark lustforlife brio, while John Darnielle personalizes his sympathetic Mountain Goats track \"Brave\" with a getwell introduction. Longtime Kiwi pop aficionado (and top secret Merge Records cofounder) Mac McCaughan tackles \"Nostalgia's No Excuse\" as Portastatic, replete with an approximation of Knox's sneer and dollops of fuzzy distortion.And then, of course, there's the host of New Zealand acts paying their respects to their friend and inspiration. Flying Nun peers and veterans such as the Bats, Verlaines, Hamish, and David Kilgour (of the Clean), the Chills, Peter Gutteridge (providing a hypnotically reinvented \"Don't Catch Fire\"), and Shayne Carter (of Straightjacket Fits) make appearances, as do relatively fresh faces like the Checks (doing Toy Love's \"Rebel\"), the Mint Chicks, and Pumice. Even some bona fide Antipodean stars show up, including Don McGlashan (of the Mutton Birds) and Neil Finn (who covers \"It's Love\" with his wife and two kids). It's a bit of a bummer that MOR singer Boh Runga gets Knox's beloved \"Not Given Lightly\", especially considering Pearl Jam covered it well on tour in New Zealand last November and could have provided this comp yet another ringer, but her heart is in the right place.Special mention, of course, must go to Alec Bathgate, Knox's longtime partner in the Tall Dwarfs and the cowriter of many of these tracks, who contributes a sterling version of the solo Knox gem \"Glide\". There are other treats and surprises in store, too, from Jordan Luck's inspired choice of \"Becoming Something Other\" (about a father stricken by Parkinson's, highlighting Knox's sometimes twisted but always humanist lyrics) to SJD namesake Sean Donnelly's lovely \"The Outer Skin\" (a song covered by the Hope Blister way back when) to Lou Barlow's \"Song of the Tall Puppy\", from 2008's Chris Knox and the Nothing album A Warm Gun, a gentle reminder that the guy still makes records.Which leads us to the best surprises of them all: new recordings from both the Nothing and Tall Dwarfs. The Nothing song in particular, \"Nappin' in Lapland\", offers a glimpse of Knox's novel, inspiring way around his predicament: songs with singing, but no words. Leave it to Chris Knox not to ever let a little thing like a debilitating stroke get in the way of making music. "}
