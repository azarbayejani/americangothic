The nostalgia trip continues on the band's latest album, Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace, which reunites the Foos with Colour producer Gil Norton (who has since worked with Jimmy Eat World, Maxïmo Park, and Morningwood, among others). The result, however, feels like a retread, a shame for a band that as one of the few late 1990s/early 2000s modern rock groups to enjoy a long run of success has practically become a walking metonym for altrock in the same way Kleenex has for tissues. Album opener and first single \"The Pretender\" goes through the same motions as early, successful anthemic rawkers \"I'll Stick Around\" or \"Monkey Wrench\", and packing plenty of clever ideas and fistpumping firepower, it's the most interesting song the band's released in quite a while. But deploying that same vitriol proves clumsy on hardrocking postrelationship bummers like \"Let It Die\" (featuring the infinitely repeated plea \"Why'd you have to go and let it die?\") and \"Long Road to Ruin\". Even \"Erase/Replace\", sporting the album's catchiest chorus, can't atone for its hackneyed heartache and Fugazilite riffs. On The Colour and the Shape, Norton brushed up the already passé grunge sound of the Foos' debut, applying a sleeker, arenasized version of the loud/quiet dynamic he famously produced on the final three Pixies albums. While Norton's touch often sounded hyperbolic (see: Colour's \"Enough Space\" and \"Up in Arms\"), he was merely an accessory to a band that was ready for its closeup. Now, with the Foos being fullfledged rock stars, Norton's presence takes a backseat to the band's heightened technical skill, which has grown exponentially since the addition of dexterous guitarist Chris Shiflett in 1999. The band hardly rallies around Grohl's eargrabbing melodies and complementary guitar lines anymore, opting instead for a vanilla classic rock sound where vocals do their bit and showy solos or overly complicated riffs fill in the empty spaces. Bent on striking the right big rock pose at the right time, these potentially simple and endearing threeminute pop songs sound cold and detached compared to heartwrenching Foo pop gems like \"Big Me\" or \"Everlong\". For the past decade, the Foo Fighters have used acoustic numbers as placeholders to fill out their albums, a trick gone too far on 2006's unplugged record Skin and Bones. Several campuslawn ballads on Echoes trigger nightmarish flashbacks from that live album, most notably \"Stranger Things Have Happened\" and \"But, Honestly\". Grohl's splitpersonality of happygolucky punkprankster and tearyeyed balladeer has never felt more dissonant than on these heartonsleeve pieces, and unfortunately, a quarter of the album succumbs to this schmaltz. Echoes does attempt to forge new ground, as Grohl's longtime affinity for Tom Petty sounds very apparent on the Americanafaded \"Statues\" and \"Summer's End\", though the novelty quickly wears off, the coyotehowl of the guitars lacking the necessary power to mask the drab melodies.Echoes' most telling slipup comes during \"Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners\", an instrumental track dedicated to the Tasmania coal mine victims that clashes the band's magnanimous intentions with an awkward musical direction. Sounding like a Led Zeppelin III outtake, the track highlights the Foo Fighters' unsolicited willingness to be everything to everybody all the time. Consequently, they're sounding less and less relatable, leaving us pining not just for the days of a little grunge trio from Seattle, but for the relentlessly catchy and charismatic Dave Grohl of the Foos' stillfantastic selftitled debut and the better half of The Colour and the Shape.
