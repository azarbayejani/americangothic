{"label":" Young God","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/13089/homepage_large.1de7f1d2.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amy Granzin","artist":"Larkin Grimm","title":"Parplar","text":" Over the course of several selfreleased albums, Larkin Grimm has carved a niche for herself among the freakfolk contingent as an actual freak. In most cases, that's an illfitting, derisive label for today's folk revivalists. But Grimm, who was born in a Memphis commune, looks like a Dolce & Gabbana model, writes lyrics so raw they'd make Peaches blush, and cultivates a pagan earth mother/witch persona, would be unlikely to argue with it. As much as her public self and acoustic guitarbased music reveal genuine eccentricity (would Michael Gira have signed her to his Young God label otherwise?), Grimm is Yaleeducated, welltraveled and no feral naïf. Indeed, her reworking of folk traditions and the roles women play in them share core concerns and strategies with early academic feminists and the deconstructive fiction of Angela Carter, who famously reinjected blood/sugar/sex/magic into the fairy tales of those other, Victorian, Grimms. As with Carter's fiction, Grimm's music, particularly in her latest, Parplar, can be wondrous and wildly inventive, as well as selfindulgent and, well, kinda icky.Parplar's lead track, \"They Were Wrong\", is one of those thrilling numbers, a spooky portrait of loss and mental disintegration in which Grimm's voice develops a subtle shake through its stark fourminute run. \"Anger in Your Liver\", one of the short tracks clustered in the album's second half, is another simple composition with an aching vocal performance reminiscent of more mainstream Americana singers like Alison Kraus or Gillian Welch. Among the more eclectically arranged songs, the title track is a charming dish of bitterness served on a plate of whimsy Grimm's own tenacious \"damn the man\" lyrics serenaded by Gangesriver horns, slide whistles, and bubbly synthesizer patterns, and queasy, pitchshifting. \"How to Catch a Lizard\" is weird (in large part due to Grimm's eerie doubletracked vocals), but effective. She can interpret folk standards just fine, too in the case of \"Fall on Your Knees\", as a twangy, Cajun barn dance.But the album makes just as many awkward, even confounding, moves, and Grimm frontloads it with her creepiest cuts. \"Ride That Cyclone\", with its retro Western stylings and eyerolling double entendres, is as catchy and gimmicky as a carnival tune. \"Blond and Golden Johns\" poses as some kind of feminist reappropriation of the old whore archetype and is stained by bon mots like \"I've been penetrated/ So I'm welcome everywhere I go\", a line oneupped only by \"Dominican Rum\"'s \"The microscopic spoiled eggs inside my uterus/ Are sparkling and bursting with the greenest yellow pus.\" Elsewhere, Grimm tosses off several \"Huh?\" remarks about acid rain and bus exhaust proving, if nothing else, that her somewhat anachronistic rhetoric isn't limited to sexual politics. Sure, there's something to be said for risktaking. Most folkies stick with the milksafe, hoping to get by on the sweetness of their sounds, while Grimm serves sour with courageous gusto and humor. And Parplar is a beautiful, excitingsounding record (coproduced by Grimm and Gira), exploding with banjo, fiddle, trumpet, accordion, dulcimer, and glockenspiel, among a score of other instruments. In fact, considering much of its lyrical content, it would be far better as an instrumental album. "}
