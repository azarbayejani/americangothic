{"label":" Secretly Canadian","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/12505/homepage_large.fd1c830b.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jessica Suarez","artist":"Music Go Music","title":"Reach Out EP","text":" The anonymous members of Music Go Music are also the lessanonymous members of another, somewhatknown indie band. They don't want to be identified, and that's fair. (Although one could argue that their label voluntarily sharing this unsolicited information, and then insisting the press keep quiet about it isn't fair to their potential fans.) But since they regard their anonymity as important to their music as their synthesizers, we'll keep the secret. It's relevant to note that Music Go Music do share their other band's fascination with mysticism and the power of love. But for all the overindulgence associated with the 1970s tropes they exploit, they're somewhat chaste in their appreciation of excess.Vocal production choices are important touchstones for Music Go Music: ABBA's overdubs are here, but so is Karen Carpenter's melancholy and Geddy Lee's high notes. Scattered across their two 12\" EPs (the first, Light of Love came out in May) are references so easy to identify that it becomes hard to tell if you enjoy \"Reach Out\" because it's a good song, or because it reminds you of other good songs. In that way Music Go Music falls somewhere between Girl Talk's memory jacking and the \"postretro\" tendencies of the Pipettes.What Music Go Music remind you of is better off as a list: ELO and ABBA, the Edgar Winter Group and Journey. It's the drama and synthesizers, surely, but it's also the details. \"Let my voice be your guide,\" the female protagonist of \"Reach Out\" urges, but really it follows (as do the guitar and piano and bass) the same vocal line, creating a minitornado of drama. Each section of the song is a different flavor of schmaltz and cheese.Light as a metaphor, something used heavily in their first EP, continues across these three tracks. In Music Go Music's sunbathed world, you must face the flame (\"Reach Out\") and follow the setting sun (\"Goodbye, Everybody\"), stepping out in the morning light (\"Just Me\"). It's easy to see the light as a metaphor for love, but on \"Reach Out\" lead singer Gala Bell burns not with lust, but with \"empathy.\" It's a strange word choice and it sounds flat next to \"Reach Out\"'s bombast. But in some ways it's more appropriate, as it furthers the idea that Music Go Music are in this sound, but not of it, curious observers trying on interesting skins.\"Goodbye, Everybody\" can't maintain the high drama of its predecessor; indeed, the point seems to be morningafter deflation. It's comparatively minimal, but just as easily placed. Nearly every line is a lyrical cliché: \"all my dreams have turned to dust,\" \"can't be right to feel so wrong.\" \"Same old story, pretty sad, but true,\" it warns over piano and light orchestra strings. \"Just Me\" finishes the arc, as the speaker reminds herself that she's all she needs over a synth arpeggio that is, really, all the song needs.Music Go Music don't break character on this single. \"Just Me\", introduces a foreignsounding male background vocal that may show some selfconsciousness, but it could be just another inspired touch of authenticity. The most authentic thing Music Go Music do isn't these touches though, nor is it their appetite for excess. It's their anonymity. Each part of these songs, from the instruments, to the voices, to the lyrics, are approachable only as sounding like something else; that they themselves are only known as other people is fitting. A lot of the inspiration here came from foreign bands and foreign sounding women presented in soft focus. "}
