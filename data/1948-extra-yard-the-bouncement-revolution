Seeing how he's the first British rapper popularized on such a massive scale in America, the most common excuse critics and fans have made for him is that it's the language difference; that perhaps, due to the clipped cadence of their accents, \"British people just don't have flow?\" Maybe. But in eight months, Original Pirate Material is gonna be more embarrassing than the memory of you rocking the Stereo MCs record and the Z.Cavaricci pleated dungarees. Furthermore, disproving the \"gee, maybe the Limeys just don't know how to rhyme?\" theory is Extra Yard, the most recent in Big Dada's series of innovative hiphop comps. Mixed by DJ Excalibah (host of the excellent radio show, Tales from the Legend, on 1Xtra which is like the BBC's version of BET, but with way better music), it's a 17track mixtape of UK party hiphop whose flow drips like Britain's primary exports are honey and street cred.Extra Yard is strong out of the gate. It opens with \"A'La Fu Gives It to You\" a tight intro in which deejay A'La Fu's impeccable scratches and cuts spell out the line, \"Steppin' outta place with an extra yard\" and flows straight into Gamma's ballbusting single, \"Killer Apps\", which drops a mushroom cloud of dubby subbass under a flurry of Jamaicanflavored raps \"for your undercover attack.\" Gamma's virile chorus of, \"Yo, Rude Boy/ Huh/ Killer Apps/ We got what you need right now,\" is a wonderfully boastful pop lyric, and worth a thousand \"propas\" from a certain Izodsporting twostep artist. The comp maintains its energetic, highquality party vibe throughout; however, with a couple of exceptions, it never quite reaches the standard set with the first couple of club knockouts. Ty's looming anthem, \"We Don't Care\", drops a hooky chorus over a bragging, cocksure bass synth, while calling out those who \"claim to represent the church/ With no research of what the rest of rap is actually/ You fail factually.\" A track midway through the mix, Part 2 & LSK's \"Life Without You\", adds some refreshingly cornsyrupy twostep flavor, lightly braised with buttersmooth vocals, like El DeBarge on some futuristic R&B; tip. While the British accent can certainly inject angles and unfamiliar staccato breaks into a unique cadence, Extra Yard dispels the myth that all Brits rapping sound like Neneh Cherry with a ballgag stuffed in her mouth. Most interestingly, the comp exemplifies the aggressive style of UK bouncement, which blends hiphop and dancehall bashing with the bounce of maximum bass. It's a puree of twostep, dub, dancehall, R&B;, and garage or, in the case of Roots Manuva and Wildflower's clean, synthheavy \"Born Again\", bouncement is where dancehall meets Tchaikovsky, with a sparkling sample from the \"Nutcracker Suite\". By pairing the forwardthinking beats of the UK club scene with a cache of impenetrably solid artists and producers, these Brits are taking the American art of hiphop into unexplored, artful territories.
