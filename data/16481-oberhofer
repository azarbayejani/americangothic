Presumably, a lifetime of saying the name \"Oberhofer\" has made him particularly fond of the sound of the letter \"O\": Not a song goes by on his eponymous band's debut album without him embellishing a chorus with an \"oh oh oh,\" massaging a jaunty piano line with an \"oooh oooh oooh,\" or adding extra syllables to words like \"know\" and \"gold.\" He even pays tribute to the letter and its sonorous tones with a centerpiece track titled \"oOoO\" that, true to its alternating capitalization, pits the \"oh oh ohs\" against the \"oooh oooh oohs\" to determine which makes the ultimate \"O\" sound. (It ends in a draw.) For Oberhofer, these Ogasms are like a facial tic or a very twee form of Tourette's something he seemingly just can't help. But in traversing Time Capsules II's 10 tales of lost love and the struggle to win it back, it becomes increasingly apparent that Oberhofer isn't prone to these utterances because all this inner turmoil has left him at a loss for words. Rather, they sound more like crafty attempts to invest basic sentiment with forced, festival crowd­baiting grandeur. You can't blame Oberhofer for trying: After releasing two promising singles last year, the 21year old BrooklynviaTacoma songwriter has already scored a deal with Glassnote, and had his debut album produced by U2 goto guy Steve Lillywhite. That would make Time Capsules II the umpteenth example of a oncemodest indie band swinging for the fences in hopes of cracking the big leagues. Leadoff track \"Heart\" proves to be a textbook case of overreaching, introducing an oppressively serious, Supertrampworthy piano motif before piling on all manner of Epic Statement signifiers (marchingband drums, melodramatic pauses, wordless choral crescendos) to convey the sensation of emotion being felt very deeply. But the album's undoing isn't its ostentatious dressing; for all the gratuitous glockenspiel, strings, and candelabralit piano flourishes at work here, Oberhofer the band retains a refreshingly raucous presence. (Drummer Pete Sustarsic in particular sounds like he's waging war against the ornate instrumentation with his urgent, smashandbash style.) No, the real culprit is an unflattering mix that pushes Brad Oberhofer's overexcited voice too far in front of the music, to the point where he often sounds like the sore thumb in his own band. When he exclaims \"I know you! I know you!\" on \"I Could Go\", it sounds less like an intimate exchange between two soulmates than Christopher Guest coaching Harry Shearer and Martin Short in that old \"SNL\" synchronizedswimmers sketch. Oberhofer's callingcard singles \"Gotta Go\" and \"Away Frm U\" (rerecorded for the album) posited them as mildly flamboyant fops in the Drums mold, mixing 1950sprom balladry and 1980s newwave in a manner that drew out the playfulness in their lovelorn narratives. There are songs here that retain that spirit: \"Cruisin' FDR\" possesses a winsome \"Crocodile Rock\" quality; \"Landline\" is Pulp's \"Babies\" given an Arcade Fire makeover. But compared to the woolsweater warmth of those early recordings, Oberhofer's sadsack persona and yelping vocal ad libs come off here as less endearing and more desperate, like someone trying to oversell simple songs with eccentric affectation. We all want to root for the lovable loser, but Time Capsules II takes the Lloyd Dobler act too far: Instead of trying to win the girl back with a boomboxed window serenade, it crates a grand piano right onto the fucking lawn.
