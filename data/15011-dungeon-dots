After spending the entirety of 2010 (and even a sizeable chunk of 2009) building buzz, playing alongside Real Estate, and serving as Dan Deacon's favorite band, the release of Air Waves' debut serves as a boost to Schneit and her band's alreadyquick sprint out of the gate. In context, the lyrics of \"Knock Out\" paint the portrait of love as a boxing match, surveying the opponent (\"Can you put all your teeth out/ So we know just how you fight?\") over the vintage bounce of a sockhop floorfiller. The darker \"Radio\" carves a vignette of the demise of a relationship out of an economy of lyrics, clanging, strummed guitar, and a resilient bassline. Schneit has a weatherbeaten alto reminiscent of folk songstresses Jana Hunter, Bosque Brown, and Scout Niblett, and her thin but charming voice often strains to hit high notes that are just a hair out of reach. While \"Humdrum\" takes minimal musical elements and blends them together to create something surprisingly full sounding, \"Sweetness\" succeeds wildly with just two chords. Throughout, Dungeon Dots displays slapdash pop charm; it sometimes feels as though the running times of the songs are the exact length of time it took her to write them, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The rudimentary song structures can get plodding on \"Fort Tilden\", but even then, Schneit manages to add a simplisticbutinfectious element in this case, the \"oohoohs\" during the chorus that carries it over. There is a sense of melancholy that courses through the fiber of the record, and this is no more apparent than on the two songs that bookend Dungeon Dots. \"Waters\" is a waltz that serves as the highlight of the record, featuring glittery guitar work, sweet spothitting harmonies from Sharon Van Etten, and some of the album's best lyrics (\"Wear your purple shirt, boy/ But blue hangs on your sleeve\"). Picking both the saddest and most climactic way to end the record, closer \"Bisous\" starts as a minorkey ballad and turns quickly into a driving climax, evoking a lonely night drive with fog hanging low on the street, while Schneit dejectedly sings, \"We wait for a change, but that change never came.\" There is a rawness, both musical and emotional, in the best moments of Dungeon Dots, proving that the simplest ways to communicate feelings are sometimes the most effective.
