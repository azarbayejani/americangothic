I got the record home and heard nothing of the kind. Yeah, it had some deep bass here and there, but I couldn't see how the sterile electronic production or the random, buzzing sonic excursions could be compared to the sticky, free flowing ambience of dub. I mean, I still liked it, but I found myself confused by the comparison. Now, with Pole's latest offering, the EP CD 2, I understand.CD 2 brings to the forefront the catchier, more rhythm oriented side of Pole's (somewhat limited) musical personality. Or, as the electronic eggheads of the European continent from whence Pole sprang would probably describe it, the music on CD 2 is \"Sound with a bit more organization.\" There are very clear patterns, choruses even (well, kind of...), that bring a little funk to the table. A little bidaboom to go with that digital sshhh... Now, this is ambient electronic minimalism I'm talking about, so I mean it when I say \"a little\" funk. But that small bit makes a big difference. And when combined with the dry, yet spacious production environment that brings to mind a microprocessor's idea of what comes out of a Jamaican mixing board, these patterns make for a fun EP. And the \"pure sine waves, hold the overtones please\" kind of bottom end is the clincher. So, I'm sold a cold electronic version of dub. They nailed it. "}
