With its quivering guitar, simple but effective bass line, and overlapping vocals that found Ashley Yao and John Chao testing the upper limits of their ranges with a heartmelting chorus, \"Summersend\" was the sound of a band reaching beyond itself. Teardrop Sweetheart, the album on which the surpassing \"Summersend\" can be found, shows an indie pop band inhabiting less dramatic territory than this lead track suggests, trying instead for something moodier and subtler. On tracks like \"Losing\", where electronics are prominent and the relaxed and clear voices are subjected to bits of quickcut processing, Misha could reasonably be compared to the legion of 1980scurious laptoppop bands that sprung up in the wake of Dntel/Postal Service's success just after the turn of the millennium. Their bubbly keyboards reference vintage synths rather than replicating them; clipped melodies are sung in a halfwhisper; lyrics are about the joy and heartbreak of new love. It's here, on tracks like slow musicbox tune \"Delovedly\" and the neargoth \"The Book (Of Glaciers)\", that Misha seem ensconced in an accomplished but underwhelming comfort zone, making music sure to please the converted electropop fan but just as certain to leave the dabbler wanting. Since Misha are rather workmanlike when it comes to essentials like chords and melodies, the most interesting moments on Teardrop Sweetheart come when they try something that doesn't quite seem to fit their aesthetic. It's unclear on \"Anaconda\", when they rhyme the name of the great snake with \"Honda\", whether they are referencing Sir MixALot. But the lyric, combined with a musical backing of lightly strummed nylon guitar and not much else, gives the song a playful and slightly surreal cast, a sense reinforced by Chao's call of \"Solo!\" before a pleasingly dinky synth break. \"Crystal in Love\" goes for more of an ELO vibe. Its slow intro, complete with sparkling background harmonies over a heavily flanged guitar, explodes into a midtempo psychpop tune that finds Chao singing in a cracking falsetto. It's not nearly as catchy as its forebears, sure, but it's still satisfying to hear Misha trying for a more direct emotional connection in light of the breezy but less memorable material that makes up the bulk of the record. But still: \"Summersend\". These guys wrote that, and this is their first record. While Teardrop Sweetheart is nothing amazing, I remain curious.  "}
