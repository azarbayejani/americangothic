There's two simple reasons for that: First, they've mastered the art of the labelspanning sampler/compilation, where you're always guaranteed a mixed bag but are also given a good idea of how far they're willing to stretch their roster's personae blunted abstractionists, swaggering street cats, goofballs with Moogs. Second, Stones Throw artists like to hand the ball over to Madlib. It's usually a good idea to hire a producer who can build a cohesive, identifiable sonic thumbprint even while grounding himself in everything from reggae and dub (Blunted in the Bomb Shelter Mix) to Primostash soul jazz (Shades of Blue: Madlib Invades Blue Note) to fusion (five volumes of his Mind Fusion mix series) to Bollywood scores (Beat Konducta in India) dude may be a lot of things, but predictable ain't exactly one of them.So it works out pretty well to select him as the man behind the final installment of BBE's Beat Generation series, which was inaugurated (fittingly enough) by Champion Sound collaborator and close associate Jay Dee/J Dilla on 2001's Welcome 2 Detroit. Like Dilla, Madlib has the versatility to pace a solid, multifaceted albumlength mix without making it sound monotonous, using his traditional mix of diverse beat styles and judiciously placed comic interludes. His range between weededout beats for the basement and Hennessyedup club anthems runs rampant, often on consecutive tracks that are separated by little else than a brief interstitial comedy skit. The glimmering fusionoid 1970s slow jam of Stacy Epps' buttery \"The Way That I Live\" jumps ahead a decade or three to the tinny, stuttering drummachine electro of Murs' \"Ratrace\", the woozy piano soul of Georgia Anne Muldrow's \"The Plan Pt. 1\" segues into a surefooted slab of discofunk on Defari's \"Gamble on Ya Boy\", and the faded Kodachrome strings, dusty beats, and ambient muffled shouts on Talib Kweli feature \"What It Do\" melt into the inebriated wall of bass on Roc 'C' and Oh No's \"Take That Money\" which subsequently drops right into the superminimalist lunchroom table thumpclap of Frank N Dank's \"Drinks Up!\"If that sounds like a disorienting mess on paper, the good news is that the anythinggoes AMradio theme of King of the Wigflip justifies the stylistic diversions though like most trips through the Stones Throw rolodex, the scattershot quality of the lyricism is a nagging side effect. I'll go to bat for the nononsense thugrap of Guilty Simpson, who sounds at home in the brassy triumph of \"Blow the Horns on 'Em\" and the claustrophobic drone of \"Go!\", and between Kweli, West Coast indie stalwards Defari and Murs and Organized Konfusion vet Prince Po (\"The ThangThang\"), there's a lot of experienced MCs holding down a substantial portion of the mix. And when things turn towards R&B, like they do with \"The Way That I Live\" or Frenza's Fender Rhodesdrenched loveasweed/weedaslove cut \"Yo Yo Affair Pt. 1 & 2\", it's reliably sleek.But there's rough patches: M.E.D.'s allexclamationpoints verse on \"The Ox (805)\" is undercut by Poke's guest spot, where he opens his verse with the questionable line \"It smell like shit at night/my peoples do a whole lot of shit at night\". Karriem Riggins' looselyintrospective \"Life\" runs on a brief string of contradictory lines (\"hip hop, jazz music/Thanksgiving, the best time for family/crack pipes, dirty needles/the government lying to the people\") that might be a bit more effective if he came up with more of them instead of just repeating the same ones over and over. And even though Madlib and his brother Oh No are usually as reliable on the mic as they are behind the boards, \"I Want It Back\", their track as the Professionals, feels like they're on autopilot: it might be all right if it's the first time you've heard someone invoke the whole \"hey remember Midnight Marauders\" nostalgia impulse in the process of complaining about how hip hop's been artistically diminished more likely, it's the hundredth.That aside, WLIB AM has a better hittomiss ratio than just about any radio station you can name anyways. The freeform noncommercial radio throwback aspect to King of the Wigflip gives it this odd feeling of a really skilled bit of fucking around, a steeltrap mind hard at work with a cohesive eclecticism concealed inside what sounds like an impulsive stream of consciousness. Some might hear this as a DJ playing records only he hears the connections between. Heads know better, of course on this frequency, all the pieces fit together. "}
