{"label":" Late Night Tales","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/17019/homepage_large.8319e78e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stuart Berman","artist":"MGMT","title":"LateNightTales","text":" For MGMT, the best thing about selling a million copies of your debut album is not all the cocaine, heroin, elegant cars, and models for wives that a platinum record presumably affords you. No, the real reward is in being elevated to a position where your words suddenly carry some weight, where a simple endorsement can provide a career boost to an unsung forebear. In retrospect, MGMT's wiggy, divisive 2010 release, Congratulations, was less a premeditated ploy to alienate their more casual fans than a noble attempt to turn them onto some of Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser's more eccentric influences, via songs named after cult heroes like Brian Eno and Television Personalities founder Dan Treacy. And if but one of the 39 million people who've watched the \"Kids\" video on YouTube was inspired to pick up a Spacemen 3 record on account of seeing Pete \"Sonic Boom\" Kember's name listed in the Congratulations liner notes, then his producer's fee was worth it. (Likewise, when recently invited to perform a cover for Pink Floyd Week on \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\", MGMT passed over the Floyd's deep well of FMradio standards in favor of Syd Barrett's menacing \"Lucifer Sam\".) That same charitable spirit more explicitly informs MGMT's curatorial contribution to the LateNightTales series, which draws evenly from obscure turnofthe1970s psychfolk, the more pastoral end of 80s postpunk and indie, and modern variations thereof. The tracklist is dotted with some notable avantrock icons (the Velvet Underground, Spacemen 3, Suicide), but they're represented by serenely atypical tracks (\"Ocean\", \"Lord Can You Hear Me?\" and \"Cheree\", respectively) that serve to set up this compilation's more esoteric selections. And as if to further increase their aesthetic distance from Oracular Spectacular's dayglo pop hits, the mood here is almost uniformly somber, if not downright ominous (hello there, \"Pink Frost\" by the Chills). More so than previous participants in the series, VanWyngarden and Goldwasser take the LateNightTales concept at face value, weaving together their song choices into a darknightofthesoul narrative heavy on themes of isolation and 4 a.m. introspection. Even the band's own contribution is a straightforward rendition of the one Bauhaus song (\"All We Ever Wanted Was Everything\") that perfectly suits this stonedanddethroned mood. VanWyngarden and Goldwasser take great care to ease you into this despairing headspace, opening with the fortuitously timed inclusion of a track from the recently resuscitated Disco Inferno (the gorgeously glistening \"Can't See Through It\"), and offsetting more droll depictions of loneliness (the Television Personalities' \"Stop & Smell the Roses\", Julian Cope's \"Laughing Boy\") with affecting instrumental interludes (Felt's \"Red Indians\", the Durutti Column's \"For Belgium Friends\"). However, everything on this compilation feels like a setup for and recovery from the harrowing \"Drug Song\" by Dave Bixby, a 70sera Christian folk singer whose songs of spiritual reawakening are nonetheless colored with melancholy and regret; divorced from their bornagain context, lines like \"How did I get this way/ It's so unreal/ I'm no longer a person/ I can't even feel\" seem especially resonant for a couple of guys who went from recording in their dorm room to suddenly finding themselves playing VIP parties at upscale department stores. MGMT may have gotten famous by ironically declaring they're fated to pretend, but with LateNightTales they take solace in building a soundtrack for when shit gets real. "}
