Deusner","artist":"Twilight Singers","title":"Dynamite Steps","text":" Last fall, Greg Dulli embarked on a short tour of the U.S. and the UK that dusted off chestnuts from every dark corner of his career with the Afghan Whigs and the Twilight Singers. From other 1990s altrock survivors, this might have come across as a wholly nostalgic endeavor, a way to remind fans that he's the guy who wrote \"Debonair\" and \"Honky's Ladder\". Instead, perhaps because he performed alongside a small group that stripped the songs down considerably, it was more like a victory lap, an acknowledgment that Dulli, despite being written off in the 1990s, has thrived where his onetime contemporaries have withered. His older work has aged particularly well: His lyrics have lost none of their potent psychodrama, and the scouring guitars still sound urgent and frantic perhaps because they were never beholden to the arena punk of the early 1990s. More impressively, Dulli hasn't lost his fire even in his late forties. His recent material with the Twilight Singers and the Gutter Twins proved strong and compelling. It's fitting, then, that Dulli follows that tour up with Dynamite Steps, a Twilight Singers album that resurrects his favorite themes and noirrock sounds. He's our Virgil touring an urban American purgatory, an unnamed city that never sees daytime, with more back alleys than main drags and something dangerous, illicit, and tempting on every corner. We've been here many times before, and we've seen many of these sites. Dulli's only got a set number of tricks up his sleeve, and Dynamite Steps deploys them all: the vocal soaring above the maelstrom of guitars (a trick he perfected back on the Whigs' 1965), the offkey croon that other singers might AutoTune, the delicate piano contrasting the gutter guitars, the sordid comeons masking dark existential doubts, the sudden groove as if someone stepped on the gas. Even the song titles sound familiar. How can this be the first time Dulli has named a song \"Get Lucky\" or \"Never Seen No Devil\"? While Dulli's palette is limited, he manages to ma  ke these familiar elements sound fresh and vital on Dynamite Steps, newly explosive and meaningful more than 20 years into his career. He's not redefining his sound (why should he?), but he is refining it, indulging the darker orchestrations with a more careful hand. Age lends his lyrics added gravity, as if he's become aware of impossibly high stakes, and the junkie/romance metaphors sounds all the more vital, instilling \"Never Seen No Devil\" with a caustic urgency and the title track with a hardwon transcendence. \"All rise with me/ All take your place,\" he commands on \"On the Corner\", echoing the preacherly exhortations of the Whigs' Black Love. The song's ambiguity is stirring, as the corner suggests music, drugs, lifechanging moments all serving a seedy gospel uplift. Dulli's never been the best or most precise singer, and his flirtations with key remain as shaky as ever. On the other hand, that's always been part of his appeal, his rough vocals adding a sense of damage and distress to his song, even discomfiting the listener. But he makes good, soulful use of his falsetto on \"The Beginning of the End\", shouts himself hoarse on \"Never Seen No Devil\", and shares a delicate duet with Ani DiFranco on \"Fox and the Blackbird\". But Mark Lanegan remains his low twin, lending a ceremonial moan to the goth anthem \"Waves\". He sounds like a Satanic throat singer, the devil on Dulli's shoulder belching brimstone. Dynamite Steps is Dulli's best collection since Blackberry Belle, and part of what gives the album its impact is how precisely and dynamically the album has been sequenced. Especially during the \"On the Corner\"/\"Gunshots\"/\"She Was Stolen\" run in the middle, he makes astute use of the songs' crests and troughs to shape the album into a dark parable. And yet, there's a conspiratorial hint that Dulli himself wants to escape this world, despite how studiously and extensively he has fleshed it out so far. \"You and I could go anywhere,\" he leers on \"Waves\". \"Cut your losses and I'll meet you there.\" Dulli hasn't stood us up yet.
