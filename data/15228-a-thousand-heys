{"label":" Fat Cat","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16336/homepage_large.03299f58.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Mazes","title":"A Thousand Heys","text":" Is it a minor cosmic retribution that the bands doing the best job of recreating American indie rock of the 1990s are coming from the UK? Leading the way this year is Yuck, with their selftitled LP; now emerging from the DIY scene that spawned the likeminded Male Bonding, Pens, and Spectrals, LondonviaManchester quartet Mazes make a commendable entry into that realm with their FatCat debut, A Thousand Heys. Lacking the comprehensive guitar sprawl of Yuck or the arty abrasiveness of Male Bonding, Mazes instead embody the shambling approach to versechorus songwriting found in Pavement acolytes BOAT. It's the sort of stuff dubbed \"slacker\" because it gives the impression that its consciously chosen smartdumb persona could be overcome with effort. From the lyrical standpoint of A Thousand Heys, the outside world is indeed a terrordome of obligations, demands, and entanglements that are best left to others to sort out. A sampling of singer Jack Cooper's aspirations: \"I wanna sit at home without a job,\" \"I never want anyone to have my name,\" or most pointedly, \"I never want to get out of bed, no way.\" But it's all delivered in a tart, smartalecky voice that lets you know it's inertia rather than crippling depression that gets him to this point. Despite the brisk tempos and the frazzled guitar tone, it's all too approachable to classify as punk rather than power pop. The hook of \"Surf & Turf / Maths Tag\" has exquisite classic rock architecture, belying Cooper's tendency to treat life as a spectator sport: \"I've lived a thousand days/ A thousand heys were thrown my way/ I get off trains and wave like Beatles at JFK.\" Call a song titled \"Go Betweens\" too onthenose if you must, but the exuberant chorus blasts off in such a way that the namedrop is earned. But as A Thousand Heys progresses, as the hooks soften around the edges, its derivativeness comes to the forefront. \"Boxing Clever\" is little more than adroit Pavement karaoke, while \"Wait Anyway\" and \"Cenetaph\" make an illadvised dip into bitesized Crazy Horse guitar jams. Even stranger is how \"Vampire Jive\" and \"Eva\" blur by in a minute and a half combined; all of a sudden the album's center has disappeared, and Heys is damn near over. Though it boasts a couple of heaters, A Thousand Heys butts up against the same problem faced by so many others working in this timeless but relatively basic template there are undoubtedly listeners who won't ever get enough of this stuff, but how can you distinguish yourself while still maintaining the spirit of your predecessors? Had the precocious spark of the first half been duplicated in the second, there'd be more than enough big choruses to make it a moot point a single \"hey!\" can have more impact than a thousand lesser ones.
