{"label":" Heatstroke","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/3319/homepage_large.f63e7627.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"The Foxymorons","title":"Hesitation Eyes","text":" The Foxymorons are a duo of childhood friends hailing originally from Mesquite, Texas. Their first two albums established their love of classic pop and the altcountry sounds of the mid90s, but the trail went cold after 2001's Rodeo City as David Dewese and Jerry James worked on other things in separate parts of the country. Hesitation Eyes is their longtimecoming third LP, recorded via the everpopular tapesthroughthemail technique. Strangely, it's also their highestfi record yet. Dewese and James alternate lead vocals, switching off every other song for most of the record. One of them they never specify who sings on what has a powerful, dusky croon, while the other gets by with a cranky indie rock croak. The two sound best, though, in twopart harmony, especially on the title track, which closes the album with a blast of glorious falsetto powerpop, tambourine filling in the backbeat amid thumping toms and descending guitar chords that read like a tour of Cheap Trick's greatest hits. The band takes a similar approach on \"Just Because\", which rightfully should be the album opener, but is instead slotted behind \"Harvard Hands\", a song that's too slow and uneventful for track one billing. Sequencing errors aside, the record is characterized by strong songcraft and a few nicely chosen sonic flourishes, such as the ebowed lead guitar on \"Everything Changes\" or the weird, spacey noises that open \"I'm Still in Love\" in a universe somewhere parallel to the minimal piano and drum shuffle of the song itself. As such, Hesitation Eyes is a sturdy album, a slightly more sophisticated update of the band's past output, and an indication that even with a nontraditional working relationship, the duo still has room to grow.
