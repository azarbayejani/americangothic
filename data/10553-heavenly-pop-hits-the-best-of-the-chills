Album after album of perfect antipodean indiepop, the product of fertile imaginations and far too much free time in a country that hadn't really shown up on the Western radar since tiny New Zealand lost more fighter pilots per capita during World War II than any other nation in the British Commonwealth. For a minute even the major labels were interested, snatching up acts like the Bats, Straightjacket Fits, the Verlaines, and the Chills before realizing that signing them was a lot easier than selling them. The Chills' Martin Phillipps was among the most idiosyncratic of the batch, capable of both rousing rock and breathtaking beauty. Maybe he understood that best of all, which explains why the 1990 album Submarine Bells led with the facetiously titled \"Heavenly Pop Hit\", which was certainly two of those things. As for being a hit, well, it never stood a chance. \"It's a heavenly pop hit, if anyone wants it,\" Phillipps sang almost offhandedly, over music so wonderful it's no wonder no radio station dared touch it: it would have made nearly everything else sound bad by comparison. Still, as the closest thing Phillipps ever came to a hit, \"Heavenly Pop Hit\" was, of course, the track pegged to start this 1995 bestof, released on Flying Nun as a stopgap while Phillipps was between international record labels. But there was plenty more where that song came from Phillipps was full of them and Heavenly Pop Hits: The Best of the Chills rounds up many of them for those who may not have any of the band's previous albums or collections, and who may be dismayed at the difficulty of procuring said out of print or domestically unreleased albums in the States (as of this writing, the impeccable early singles comp Kaleidoscope World was going for nearly $70 on Amazon).  Also from Submarine Bells there's the majestic \"Part Past Part Fiction\", while from the Chills' early days the set draws the irresistible shuffling tribute to a late friend \"I Love My Leather Jacket\", the pianolead \"House with 100 Rooms\", the charming love letter \"Wet Blanket\", the catchy but bleak punchtheclock welfare antianthem \"Doledrums\", and the everghostly \"Pink Frost\". All these tracks feature Phillipps' uncanny instinct for chiming guitars, humming organ, beguiling melodies, and mournful lyrics often utterly at odds with all the former elements. Lest you forget Phillipps, like nearly every songwriter of his generation, was a punk at heart, this comp tosses in \"I'll Only See You Alone Again\", \"Look for the Good in Others and They'll See the Good in You\", and \"Never Never Go\", three pounding, fuzzy garagepsych nuggets.  As for the inevitable missing stuff, where's \"Effloresce and Deliquesce\" and the gorgeous title track from Submarine Bells? Or \"Background Affair\", from Soft Bomb? Or, hell, where's that disc's \"Song for Randy Newman, etc.\", which namechecks Brian Wilson, Syd Barrett, Scott Walker, and Nick Drake as Phillipps documents the trials of the cult artist who dares tilt at windmills. \"People take so much then leave you lean,\" Phillipps sings, wistfully, at once in awe of his idols and all too aware that he will likely share the same criticsdarling fate. \"Patrons will not feed you longer than they need to/ Your allconsuming passion will leave you craving love.\"  OK, to be fair, Phillipps isn't entirely blameless when it comes to his own fate. He had trouble keeping the same band lineup intact from disc to disc, and drug problems played a recurrent role impairing his progress. But he had a point: music this perfect doesn't come for free, and seeing his heart and soul spilled out get him nowhere no doubt wore at Phillipps. Hopefully one day he'll get his due a new incarnation of the Chills has been up and running for a bit now but in the meantime, the best we'll get is documents like this one, sad reminders of what so many missed out on the first time around. Heavenly pop hits indeed. "}
