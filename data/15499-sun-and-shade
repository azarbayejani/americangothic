Songs of Shame was immediately enjoyable, as it spun together strands of folkrock, ramshackle indie, and sunshine pop into something that felt handmade and fresh. But listening to it, I didn't peg Woods as the kind of band that would keep turning out remarkably wellrealized and consistent albums on a yearly basis. Maybe it was the casual nature of their timekeeping, where all the songs amble at a loose, oblong gait. Or maybe it was the general nature of their lofi pedigree, where quantity of output is often prized over quality. But nothing about Woods at that time said \"consistent album band\" to me. Two years and two fulllengths later, \"consistent album band\" describes Woods very well. Last year's At Echo Lake didn't have a weak song on it and showcased the strength of their songwriting on the most fundamental terms. I still find myself humming tunes from it at weird times, even when I haven't listened to it in months. Now they return with Sun and Shade, another very solid record that finds them returning in spots to the experimental vein explored on earlier records and in their live show. They haven't changed their sound in the least, but they're demonstrating that there's a lot more to be done with it than might have been expected. The experimentation comes in the form of two longer instrumentals that take up about 17 of the album's 44 minutes. \"Out of the Eye\" is a Krautrock homage constructed from the basic ingredients of Neu!'s \"Hallogallo\", but slowed down by a third and with a Middle Eastern tinge in the guitars. Where bands like Stereolab built something driving and forceful around the iconic motorik groove of the Neu! original, Woods' rickety aesthetic can't help but keep human imperfection in the mix. These guys don't do \"robotic,\" and no one will ever mistake the laidback percussion on a Woods record for a drum machine. Which means that the shadowy steadystate psych of \"Out of the Eye\" unfolds patiently and isn't afraid to meander a little. But when it closes abruptly with a quick drum roll seven minutes in, it gives the impression that the preceding was more of a sketch or onetake jam rather than anything designed for a specific effect, which slightly undercuts its power. The nearly 10minute \"Sol y Sombra\" is the other long track, and it features spare hand percussion, acoustic guitars, and some distant electric guitar leads. It still scans as \"1970s Germany,\" but here the basic model is the pastoral psych of Popol Vuh from the middle of that decade. They both manage to capture a mood and wring feeling out of them, but \"Sol y Sombra\" and \"Out of the Eye\" sometimes have me reaching for the \"skip\" button. That's partly because Woods continue to craft such memorable tunes when working in guitarpop mode. Like \"Pushing Onlys\", the early single from Sun and Shade, which has chiming guitars and a classic pop melody catchy enough to hang with 60s confections by the Turtles or the Hollies. While Jeremy Earl's cracking voice is in the long line of \"sounds kinda like Neil Young\" high tenors, Woods' Aquarian Age references often lean toward the bouncy and optimistic bubblegum of the era. Here, that spirit comes to the fore on the elegant shuffle \"Who Do I Think I Am?\" and \"What Faces the Sheet\", which is built around a guitar riff vaguely reminiscent of \"Then He Kissed Me\". Folkier songs like \"Be All Be Easy\" and \"Wouldn't Waste\" bring to mind the sound of folkpop heroes growing into singersongwriters, a spirit best exemplified by Graham Nash, whom Woods covered on Songs of Shame. In whatever mode they're working, the takeaway is that Woods are good at all these sounds, and they seem to be striving to get even better. Despite their ultraslack style and prodigious output, nothing about them says \"halfassed,\" so it's another year, another fine Woods album. "}
