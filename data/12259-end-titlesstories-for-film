{"label":" Surrender All","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/12551/homepage_large.0ef1fe22.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"UNKLE","title":"End Titles...Stories for Film","text":" On this year's Mixtape About Nothing, Wale boasted that \"hype gets you Rick Mirer'd every single time,\" but he might want to go back to the drawing board with that one (and maybe go with Ron Powlus for the joke) the former Golden Dome golden boy still managed to parlay his pedigree into an uninspiring, but lengthy eightyear NFL career as a serviceable backup on generally godawful Seahawks, Lions, and Bears teams. This sort of explains James Lavelle it's hard to imagine any reallife situation where Psyence Fiction somehow justified every expectation that preceded it, but thanks in part to the very memory of those expectations, UNKLE has still managed an improbable decadeplus of survival.It's a pretty sad day when the selfpromoter extraordinaire Lavelle starts softpedaling his projects, and the gist of End Titles...Stories for Film is that we shouldn't confuse it as being \"the new UNKLE album,\" but rather as a clearinghouse of collaborative songs coming from various projects among them BMW commercials (\"Trouble in Paradise\"), Alex Grazioli's indie film Odyssey In Rome, as well as the cutout bin from previous UNKLE recording sessions. To put it another way, it's formatted almost the exact same way the previous UNKLE LPs were, and no one's going to give a shit because DJ Shadow, Thom Yorke, Kool G Rap, and Jason Newsted have absolutely nothing to do with it.  At the very least, End Titles is far more cohesive than its birthing process would imply. Yeah, the sheer statistics are daunting (22 tracks, 75 minutes), but it flows in that Sufjan way where interstitial noodling makes the longer, more trad formats fit in a mesmeric manner End Titles rewards just about any amount of listening investment equally, and it completely lacks sharp edges. It has acoustic guitars shaved of brassy treble, electrics coasting on reverb, and vocals blunted with foggy echo blanketing slowly modulating melodic lines. Perhaps befitting its nature as a presumptive soundtrack, it's a long listen, but not necessarily a difficult one.Of course, the reason for this cohesion is a problem that spawned perhaps out of inevitably during the sessions for War Stories; somewhere along the line, maybe intimidated by the genremashing present he envisioned on Psyence Fiction, Lavelle just sort of gave up, dropped any pretense of hiphop influence and became an overseer of a downtempo and overcast Britrock, bland and grey as a London sky or a London steak. Needless to say, the lead singer from South feels right at home here.There's actually a sort of Curious Case of Benjamin Button shit going on here Psyence Fiction anticipated omnivorous fanhood in 2008 more than the actual pop music, and now Lavelle's project has backslid into 2001, when he cosigned on his first project with South's From Here On In, an album with a remarkably similar makeup of asleepatthewheel instrumentals and hookless, murky songs that each run about a minute too long. Befitting his background, most of the tracks here have a percussive depth, drum tracks more breakbeatish than fouronthefloor and the bass riffs usually more memorable than the ones on guitar. But the problem isn't so much about having relative unknowns as vocalists, but rather how nearly all of them (Lavelle included) play to the foggy material herein. Friendtiltheend Josh Homme and Black Mountain make relatively notable appearances, but both of them are far more suited to the desert than the tundra of Lavelle productions. The Homme vehicle \"Chemical\" is bled cold and clammy and while \"Blade in the Black\" is perhaps the most striking cut, with a nearly soulful performance from soppy folk artist Gavin Clark and some intriguing horn stabs, but the song itself needs grease, not a coating of plexiglass. Letting Ferrara sing on obvious album exit point \"Open Your Eyes\" may be a quid pro quo, but if there was ever a time to rekindle your love with AutoTune, it's hearing him warble like Eddie Murphy's DylanviaBuckwheat skit over charmless coffeehouse strumming.You would figure that the bitesized instrumental portions represent a chance for them to experiment, not being beholden to song structure, but instead there's the old tautology of strings=cinematic, so thus for cinema, cue the strings. But in the end, the reason that UNKLE is likely seeking soundtrack work is the reason End Titles fails to engage as a singular experience: they've always been more about the Rolodex than the Roland and now, they're asking for an additional disconnect of \"I guess you had to see the movie.\" Psyence Fiction may have been a blockbuster, overhyped or not, but at this point, UNKLE's franchise is strictly straighttovideo.
