After 10 years of dudes combing Salvation Army dollar bins and buying every 12\" with a moustache sleeve and an Italian producer, panhandler partypeople 2000 better get used to some silverage guido anthems, and in some cases flatout fool's gold. Seriously, give Geist a (platinum) medal can't imagine whose slits he scoured for last year's perfect altalo masterpiece. Turns out Geist's chum Alec DeRuggiero, who does booking for NYC's APT, didn't do so bad for himself either. Selflessly mixed, his Italo DeRuggiero discs came in and out and in last year, drawing from that same wayleftofcenter region of italo that Geist did for Unclassics. Perhaps that's less a preference than a matter of fact after the glut of \"definitive\" italo comps in the late 90s the Geistgeist of our times? (No more handclaps, please, thank you.) The first disc is more cool than camp in this world that's sometimes a bad thing. While the grouchette vox on Special Edsampled Belle Epoque's \"Miss Broadway\", the sixoclock news piano bounce on Kasso's \"Walkman\", the condomfree fuckfest that is Discotheque's \"Disco Special\" (also on Unclassics, yes) and Lily Ann's ditzy soft dentals on \"I'm Going Crazy\" count among the best italo I've heard period, some of Alec D's misfit toys just don't want to be loved, and instead wallow in some serious Where Were You Twenty Years Ago. But it's like what the fuck, you're Answering Service's \"Call Me Mr. Telephone\"! Don't give me that shit! The backhalf of this mix has a lot of pride for sure a nice reminder that most italo is total fucking garbage. Advanced calculus, economics, and you know, common sense say that the tracklisting for Italo DeRuggiero Parte Due should be spottier than the first one. Sorta the case here, but also sorta not the case. Parte Due lacks the first disc's highs, but doesn't suffer from the first disc's lows either. It's like the first disc's Bside trackier, dubbier, sillier, way way nerdier. For some reason each track chugs harder and better than the one before it, a tall claim to make when Stopp's cult classic \"I'm Hungry\" (\"Hey! It's fun! You gotta cook a meal for everyone!) has the six spot. But check it: Down to the song's title, Mike Mareen's \"Don't Leave Me Now\" rivals this new Out Hud With Vocals! thing everyone's all excited about, Pineapples' dub of \"Come On Closer\" actually jacks, and Cellophane's \"Music Colours (Part 3)\" is New Order but totally gay. I'd come out and say nothing's gonna top gay New Order, but Trophy's \"Slow Flight\" does, so I'll get back in my hat. "}
