{"label":" Greedhead","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/17646/homepage_large.9a901b09.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Big Baby Gandhi","title":"No1 2 Look Up 2","text":" \"Where we from, there is no one to look up to.\" That line pops up on the first proper track of Big Baby Gandhi's No1 2 Look Up 2, and its impact is crucial for two reasons. The first is pretty obvious, but what's more interesting to me is who actually says it. Though Das Racist's Heems casually spits that aforementioned lyric on his guest verse, it's a heavy acknowledgment of the alienation that courses through everything his truly singular group does. Whether racially, culturally, or intellectually, Das Racist continually struggle with the \"otherness\" levied on them as rappers, as Americans and as human beings. So it's actually ironic that Gandhi's first Greedhead release takes its name from that line: Heems runs the label on which this is being released, and Das Racist are clearly role models for the 21year old Queens MC. After the \"once and never again\" listen of \"Long Ass Intro\", \"Blue Magic\" gives you an idea of what Das Racist see in Gandhi, as his flow is almost 100% influenced by that of their frequent collaborator Danny Brown. But where tracks like \"Power\" and \"The Last Huzzah\" showed Brown's livewire and Das Racist's deadpan styles deployed with equal skill, Gandhi flails for punchlines and gets calmly and completely overwhelmed by his mentors. Both Heems and Kool A.D. have taken things to interesting places since Relax, and this is the best they've sounded together on the same track since their unbeatable 2010 run. If not for Heems' repeating one of Gandhi's lines, you'd forget he actually showed up. \"All Over These Titties\" achieves the same result in a completely different way. Initially another display of Greedhead's weakness for Spank Rockstyle party rap, it instead becomes a showcase for chirpy nohoper Chippy Nonstop and a warning that if crews are going to insist on having their own Kreayshawn, they should at least be expected to come up with their own catchphrases. That Chippy seems to have picked her name simply to rhyme it with \"trippy mayne\" just makes you hope she doesn't have too many student loans. For anyone who's doubted Das Racist's staying power, they now have a clear stylistic descendant although Gandhi mostly steamrolls his predecessors' idiosyncrasies by making his delivery louder, and more awkward. His lyrics tend to downplay the \"Wikipedia it if you didn't know it\" factor in exchange for plainspoken demands of blowjobs and beer, remaining heavy on sneaky ethnocentric volleys, homages to mid1990s NYC rap, repetition and \"all that smart shit that's actually stupid.\" That said, no amount of reverse psychology makes lines like \"call me gay rapper the way I get in that ass\" and \"I love you like a fat kid loves cake or how a lot of wack kids love... Drake\" any less eyerolling. And while he manages to tone down the nasal stridency that makes the Brown comparisons unavoidable, Gandhi is still locked into allcaps yelling sprees that run roughshod over the beats, showing little ear for flexibility, cadence or melody which is fairly strange since a lot of the production is his own. He's got plenty of work to do in that area too whether it's the Big Willie Style­ poprap of \"Boogie Nights\" or the Def Jux arrhythmia of \"Stack City\", you can immediately spot Gandhi's beats as the ones that sound like they were mastered on an laptop speakers. The potential's there, though, and you can sense it particularly towards No1's promising back half when Gandhi drops his implausible pose as a hiphop savior and raps as himself an overstimulated yet bored young adult. It comes through when he guilelessly references how \"I'm a grown man, I cry my own tears/ Buy my own beers/ Drink my own beers,\" raps about being ignored by women of various races on various NYC subway lines (\"Drink a Lil Pepsi\"), and admits to the dangers posed by very real economic factors more pernicious than any preGiuliani bogeyman. Though nowhere near guys like Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire or Action Bronson in terms of skill, through equal parts selfloathing and selfdeprecation, New York is similarly rendered as a shithole of dumpy apartments, racial misunderstanding, broke overachievers, and nonexistent opportunity. It's something that's fairly easy for anyone of a certain age to relate to, even before you take into account how it's compounded by Gandhi's ethnicity being lumped into a post9/11 \"other\" if it's even acknowledged. As such, \"money on my mind\" tracks like \"Get $$$$\" and \"Post Nihilism\" have a grubby realness, as Gandhi acknowledges the incremental but important financial gains made by him and his family \"Used to be all sad because I had to wear a rag/ In trends I would lag/ My friends they would laugh/ Everybody copped prints all I had was a plaid.\" Meanwhile, \"Eulogy\" might just be enough to redeem the entirety of No1, a staggering memorial for Gandhi's uncle where he tries to sort out complex feelings for a complex man whose deplorable actions had their own survivalist wisdom: \"If you was here right now/ You'd call me a bitch/ Like 'why you cryin' in front of all these people talkin' about your feelings and shit?'\" Moments like those feel like signs of a promising voice coming into his own, whereas obvious money shots like \"a long time ago I ain't even wanna flow/ My peoples gettin' locked up in Guantanamo/ My peoples still up in Guantanamo/ But I fell in love with the gold and designer clothes\" ring hollow. Granted, it's worth applauding any acknowledgment of the unyielding philosophies that spur the War on Terror, but context matters: Gandhi's been rapping since his teens and when you consider the anticommercial prospects of No1 and the situation that allows him to make it, how are we supposed to get a real sense of conflict or compromise? Gandhi doesn't have the gravitas or platform to pull off that sort of \"Diamonds From Sierra Leone\" bluster, so a simply rendered line like, \"When I was 16, I rhymed about society, poverty and other shit that bothered me/ Now all I know is no dough, I can't go to sleep,\" hits harder.  And ultimately, that's the sort of thing that hamstrings Gandhi. When clarifying a harshly worded, still kinda vague line from his Big Fucking Baby tape to the Brown Noise blog, he said, \"It's a shot at the white rap journalists who are the biggest reinforcers of these stereotypes through their limited understanding of the culture and environments they write about.\" White rap journalist or not, it's depressing to read these kind of things because this sort of attitude almost always stifles discussion rather than fostering understanding. But it's more depressing for someone who's in an expressive artform to preemptively shift the blame to the listener in case he can't get his point across. It's a shame too, since Gandhi does represent an interesting voice that deserves to be heard, and judging from No1, he's very much aware of what he wants to say. The problem is how he says it.  "}
