Such folks make their names by either subverting with roomclearing studio productions or make asses outta themselves for passersby to throw nickels in their hats. Given their album title, Nothing Is Cool, guess what classifies our brothers from Vancouver, McEnroe and Birdapres? On the record jacket, they sit on a bench with bored faces. Birdapres asks, \"Hey, what's cool?\" A pause. McEnroe's reply: \"Nothing.\" The end. That old bit about hopeless cynics still evokes a chuckle ever since it debuted on a skateboard 15 years ago. It works for these gentlemen as well. Given that bulletproof irony is now obsolete, their verses must be judged as pure sincerity. McEnroe and Birdapres are underground MCs who seemingly spent too many long nights waiting for their turns at 20man concert bills, performing for halfasleep audiences and then adding up every measly dollar they earned to cover gas. They paid their dues and now believe that everyone owes them. \"Holler if you hear me/ Hear me if you holler√ânone of us will ever appear at the Apollo,\" mopes Birdapres in the zinger, \"Grumpy Old Men\". Their loserrap can be charming \"Grumpy Old Man\"'s crocodile tearjerking piano melody fits when the guys kick dirt over high school bullies becoming Bboys and gym teachers trying to impress the kids by rapping. But on album closer \"F*@K You 2K3\", when they tell 95% of the world to screw themselves, including carbohydrates and aspiring MCs who email them lyrics, they are nothing more than sour grapes who deserve audience indifference during their shows. \"Fuck rap music in general,\" carps Birdapres. Indeed. The title track joins the indie rap tradition of complaining about the Phonies in blingbling. Their horrorshow of the industry's decadence is as old as IceT's \"don't you be like me\" afterschool lectures about the penthouses, harems, and semiautomatics he never really owned. Plus, if you're going to rap about devils in threepiece suits jacking you over, either make your audience smile (\"If you take a shit, they want to know,\" A Tribe Called Quest's \"Show Business\") or make then nod along with downcast eyes (Blackalicious's \"Shallow Days\"). Just don't rub your face against the window of a rich rapper's soiree, (\"Martinis and cigars, does anybody give a fuck who we are?\" quote Birdapres). McEnroe later shouts, \"People think I'm an independent and I don't want money/ But I want a fistfull!\"  When they're not throwing rocks, McEnroe and Birdapres don't have much to prove besides sampling a few good records. Oh, they brag about their frickin' cool soundsystem (\"5000 Watts\"), drink cheap beer over credit card debt (\"Broke Beat\"), or fantasize about mafias that Hollywood sold them (\"Family Business\"). But their production is Nothing's saving grace. Every break flows with the rhyming, whether they are Mexican soap opera orchestras or frontporch guitar riffs. Our dear brothers even know it; their chorus on the cratedigging ode, \"Break Merchant\" is \"No, you can't sample this break!\"  Their rhyme skills aren't bad either, as McEnroe reminds us, \"Fuck the critics who say I can't rap in the first place/ That's absurd in the worse way.\" They also have the right voices: McEnroe's tone resembles an ELP bickering over the TV news, while the nimble Birdapres sounds akin to Lyrics Born after five shots of NyQuil. But it's their choices from the King's English that sinks them. They diss \"The Worst Person\", an anonymous sonofabitch who picks his nose, hogs the basketball, and \"asks too many questions and doesn't wait for answers.\" And by the way, \"Of course he smokes, because he's, like, the worst person.\"  "}
