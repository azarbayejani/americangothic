{"label":" Dicristina","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/13715/homepage_large.2149933e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Roque Strew","artist":"MV & EE","title":"Drone Trailer","text":" The freakfolk universe has two major poles. One is represented by the Jewelled Antler collective, the San Francisco wing of the operation. The other surrounds Vermont's Matthew Valentine, who rose to a kind of prominence as Tower Recordings, and more recently plays as MV & EE with his partner Erika Elder.   Of course, there is plenty more to this freewheeling, loosely defined scene. And, at his best, Valentine embodies everything that marked freak folk as a promising path for American musicians looking to place a woodsy focus on acoustic sounds, whether Western banjos or Eastern tablas. The new record breaks rank.  Drone Trailer  arrives after numerous CDRs and tapes of crosscultural, relentlessly unconventional music to stargaze by bearing principally unthreatening, oldfashioned rock'n'roll.  A curveball of cosmic proportions, \"Anyway\" opens the record, muscling through with fuzzy, hardrock riffs. The cataract of distortion overpowers Erika Elder's singing, leaving audible only the enigmatic question, \"Hey spaceman, hey spaceman/ Whatever happened to the master plan?\" Valentine repeats, \"Anyway I can\" from across the room, a gentle faraway presence that sounds spectral and disembodied.Turning around completely, \"The Hungry Stones\" finds Valentine channeling Neil Young circa  Sugar Mountain. A surprising juxtaposition of closeup harmonica and distant distortions amplifies the melancholic singing and nostalgicstoner lyrics. The sleepy vocals and daydream guitars on the 10minute \"Weatherhead Hollow\" and \"Huna Cosm\" verge on slowcore, a sort of bucolic Low. The title track suggests a Deep SouthmeetstheSubcontinent fantasia, in the soupy swirling together of Doc Dunn's curving pedal steel, Valentine's bantar, and Elder's anesthetized, steelmagnolia delivery. A fitting summation of a batshit philosophy that, on  Drone Trailer,  goes down easier as straightahead rock. "}
