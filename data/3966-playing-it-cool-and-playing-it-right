Taken together, even in normal dosages, the combined effect of pharmaceutical painkiller and the dusted earlyeighties dub of Keith Hudson is woozy and disorienting in all the right ways. It would be hard to tell anything just from the cover reproduction. My prescription bottle's got ten times the info. A faded, slightly stained, plain card sleeve has only Hudson's name and \"Playing It Cool\" stamped across the front; nary a sliver of information is found as to who took part. Research ties it to the Wackie's crew, which does make a modicum of sense, as Basic Channel spearheaded the Lloyd \"Bullwackie\" Barnes set of reissues that documented his peculiar Bronx seepage from the turn of the decade. Even in light of the high work so far, this is one messedup set. In what would fatally be his penultimate release, Hudson recapitulates six old rhythms, but with his intimate knowledge of them, he cuts the heads up from the start, each element destabilized. By the time of \"California\"/ \"By Night Dub\", Playing it Cool and Playing it Right takes a dark turn, much like the drive croaked about within the grooves. Over the distant humming of two girls singers (the Love Joys, perhaps?), Hudson croons about the \"darkest night on the wetlooking road\" that envelopes both his head and road trip, and the voxrippled guitars and murky drum hits stir up a dense dub mud that clouds all signposts. A drum crumbles over the damaged voices, and even at a slurred speed, the landscape is blurry. Even this couldn't prepare you for the showcase of \"Not Good for Us\"/ \"Formula Dub\": double and tripletracking painfully outoftune ramblings and crazed crooning, Hudson ends up kneedeep in the frontal lobe goop that Ol' Dirty Bast uh, Dirt McGirt slops about in. Shouting \"too much formula ain't good for my head, ain't good for the dread,\" with about as much heed paid for its own warning as Melle Mel's \"White Lines\" or a Sly Stone antidrug PSA, every voice of Hudson's is sucked down the drain. The banged piano stumbles behind as spedout guitars threaten to pull free of the tape, the beat flickering in and out of consciousness. With scarce regard for rhythm or levels, Hudson flashes infinitelyripp(l)ed congas and guitars immediately into \"Be What You Want to Be\"/ \"Be Good Dub\" which makes every other instrument shake in its wake. Most soulful is the last set, \"I Can't Do Without You\", which confirms how much American soul, funk, and rock went into Hudson's productions by this time. It only clocks in at a halfhour, but with a tangibly tainted vibe that tastes as much like drugaddled rock classics like Dr. John's Gris Gris or Funkadelic's Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow as it does Lee Perry's Super Ape, it's a long, strange trip.
