{"label":" Mille Plateaux","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/1920/homepage_large.5a5e877d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Cameron Macdonald","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Clicks & Cuts 4","text":" Clicks_+_Cuts was supposed to be the future. Right after the Y2K Bug was a dud and modern civilization realized that it didn't have to organize militias to defend top ramen and Wonderbread supplies, Frankfurt electronica label Mille Plateaux announced its \"first genre\" of the 21st century.Clicks_+_Cuts was their vanguard a compilation of artists romancing the glitch or, ahem, intentional accidents with their audio software. The tripledisc Clicks & Cuts 2 and Mille Plateaux's tragically underrated Electric Ladyland: ClickHop Version 1.0 kept the street festival alive for the entire year of 2001, branching off into the virgin lands of microhouse and digital slapstick. And then came the butcher's bill. As revolutions usually go, the CC aged in dog years and died of natural causes. A funeral wake followed within two years when Mille Plateuax dared to release Clicks & Cuts 3. It seemed that the once almighty label began venturing into a marketing firm for Motorola cell phones, cologne, and breathfresher gum; concocting soundtracks ripe for ladies in offwhite unisex bodysuits lounging in matching rooms. The curiosities and mysteries were over. Mille Plateaux had great nerve to revive the Clicks & Cuts series with this fourth volume. Yet, most of its music is terribly comforting. Much of the CC regulars here seemingly draw from the same well of ideas Morse Code beats, menthollit, jazz organ harmonies, and locust symphonies of clickeyklack glitches. Nonetheless, there is scant homogeny it's more of a DJ mix that drizzles time with much breathing space. Frank Elting's \"Spoken Word\" opens with a lackluster, humidifier lounge number. The following \"Got Mad Love\" by Micronost is more promising with a crunk tune that vaguely recalls M's whitebread disco hit, \"Pop Muzik\". Eight Frozen Modules' \"Dogsbark People Grow\" then grooves with coagulated synth harmonies flailing like doublejointed limbs, and a foghorn Rhodes organ blaring hopeless warnings. The majority of CC 4 explores rainstrewn digital decay and the melancholy that entails. Electric Birds' soothing \"When I See the Sun\" kathunks along with confused satellite signals and a solarized guitar tone that steams through gutters. Tilman Ehrhorn's \"Clear\" ventures into the loopjazz territory that is wellstaked by Jan Jelinek. Yet, the song is somehow imbued with a greater scope as its digital static sways like birch branches; it bleeds into the amniotic digitaldub of Jay Haze's \"Too Good\" that recalls Vladislav Delay's glory days. Twerk and Thomas Brinkmann toy with oddball field recordings of Japanese chatter. The former's \"Haiiro\" sheds some Rhodes tears whilst a shaving session and a conversation between a Japanese man and kid, the latter's \"Decoupe\" enters an alleyway full of annoyed shouting, offset by some peculiar Geiger Counter funk. Ultrared's utterly surreal \"Neue Wirtschaft (Freedom of Movement)\" begins with a sample of a rally speaker stressing the importance of defying privatized space, and then falls into spastic microfunk. I wish CC 4 had a cliffhanger ending such as Bizz Circuits' stroboscope horrorshow \"Ghetto Ambient\" instead of HÃ¥kan Libdo's anemic dub shrug, \"Lebensformen\". Sebastian Meissner (Bizz) boils a Middle Eastern orchestra in raw diesel, causing it to jitter for dear life, cutting it off when the tension sinks the soul, and proving there is still some kick left in glitch.
