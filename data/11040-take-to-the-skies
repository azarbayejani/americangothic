For better or worse, this is how we end up with stuff like the Advantage, A Hillbilly Tribute to AC/DC and \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\". And now, joining the mayonnaiseonfrenchfries sweepstakes with an unholy union of posthardcore and hiNRG keyboards, is Enter Shikari. While it doesn't match SwitchedOn Bach for instant illogical strangeness, this upstart quartet's inspired decision to laminate energetic synthesizer blasts onto their cacophonous thrash does sound like a recipe for disaster on first blush. Surely one component of the combo will be made to suffer, either by the peppy keys rendering the metallic clatter toothless or the headbanging stuff turning the dance touches into brittle irony. Fortunately, the synth treatments on Take to the Skies are sufficiently superficial that there's no real threat of obtrusiveness on either side. The trance and rave elements almost invariably shimmery, galloping little things are just pronounced enough to lend a happy novelty to the proceedings, occasionally buoying the likes of \"No Sssweat\" and \"Labyrinth\" but rarely dictating the real pulse or tenor of a song.  What we're left with then is a schizophrenic posthardcore outfit, oscillating at expected junctures between unmitigated thrash and conventional rock passages. Lead singer Roughton \"Rou\" Reynolds transitions ably between larynxshredding sandpaper yelps (plus occasional Cookie Monster growl) and cleanly plaintive emoting, with bassist Chris Batten also adding pristine pipes to fulfill the Daron Malakian role for a band that quite often evokes System of a Down (particularly on the anthemic \"Mothership\").  As it is with many debuts, Take to the Skies reveals a band working to pin down what it does well, trying on several hats and seeing which ones fit. Surprisingly, many do songs like \"Sorry, You're Not a Winner\" and the single \"Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour...\" showcase a facility with riffage, while \"Jonny Sniper\" and \"OK, Time For Plan B\" nicely proffer tuneful, searching poprock, the latter sounding downright New Romantic in spots. At the same time, however, many of the conventional rock moments sound, well, blandly conventional, and the utterly inconsequential comedown \"Today Won't Go Down in History\" suggests it'll be some time before Enter Shikari masters quieter, more ruminative fare.  In order to make sure they get that time, the band will likely need to either refine or ditch altogether the synthesized window dressing in its current incarnation it's the kind of semiclever gimmick that's practically guaranteed to grow stale if overused. Surely it'll take a little more than a simple formula of \"sonic blitzkrieg + cheesy keys\" to keep the majority of Shikari's 183,900odd MySpace buddies compelled for the long haul.  "}
