Please string together these notes with some smooth fanmailgenerating transitions (supersmooth, like telethon segues) and maybe some sex or potatochipdookie jokes. This is that CD by the Euphone guy Ryan Rapsys and the Owls guy Victor Villareal.]Fucking primadonna writers... Noyes? Do something about the bandname being either a pun on \"noise\" or maybe a typical CapNJazz gesture, like Kinsella's \"Friend/Enemy\" except this is a negative affirmation, \"no/yes.\" All Google yields is a minor, minor poet and two museums. Can't even find a guaranteed ethnicity. Might be a street name if the liner notes aren't a dickaround. Could be a ref. to Ernest Noyes Brookings...you know, the senior citizen songwriter Yo La Tengo, Idlewild, and Robyn Hitchcock cover. Ryan, doesn't the new Pitchfork office have interns that could be my factchecking cuzzes here? Yes, I listened to Pavement as I rode my bike in the wind today. I had total nineties hair. Jesus H. Candlebox, let's face the musiquarium: Victor Villareal is the best guitar player alive. Strike \"player\"; he's a manipulator, a revisionist, a masseuse he should test axxxes for Consumer Reports when NASA sends guitars into space for the big thing when Elton John dies during the next Democratic presidency. I will one day tell my kids about shaking Vic's brilliant hand after an Owls show, even though he was talking to the lispy, shutin cokehead I had a crush on before her parents yanked her out of school and confined her to their town named for a gay saint. This band's full length should be called Keeping It Villareal. Bowers, you are pushing it. Oh my diffident God, he milks the instrument's elasticity. Chris: use \"symphonic,\" \"collapsible\" and \"parlous.\" It's like the instrument has lice, and he's coaxing them out, unafraid to venture from the antiseptic glory of the postrock shimmertone, flirting with \"world\" and \"metal\" interludes. Word is Villareal can't even keep track of his tunings. That stench? The absent mind of GENIUS. Good old Rapsys is a oneman rhythmsection all over the globe. His Ulrichy doublations must be why the first track got called \"Puppet Of Masters\"; my desktop Bose were producing air like warehouse turbines. The vocal track \"News Scatters\" showcases more tinny funkdub talent (from a duo, recall) in its two minutes than many pedalstockpiling fourpieces muster throughout whole albums. Rapsys matches and accents Vic's every pullbackandrelease on \"This Is The Bad 1\". Wait until \"So Long, Long Songtitles\" (another possible Kinsella reference?) when Villareal relaxes with his most repetitive and mundane pinchriff, because Rapsys brings the bottomend noise as well the cyborgy keys and Mick Turnerstyle atmospherics. So Ott, I gotta get outta here. Just warn people who find all \"post\" stuff a tad manila that they might find these prodigysteeds and virtuosibums...a tad manila. And get the phrase \"soul music that requires a scientific calculator\" in there somewhere. Maybe a line about kitchen appliances slowdancing. Man, that was effedup how in Gremlins, they were cooking and dicing those Gremlins (which obviously represented teenagers) and then Spielberg would make Schindler's List. I mean, Gremlins was like Teenage Holocuast. Consider ending the review with a Public Enemy shoutout (Bring the Noyes!), but I can't tell if that'd be dingleberry or not. "}
