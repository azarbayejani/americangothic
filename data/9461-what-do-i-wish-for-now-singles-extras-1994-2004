(Singles + Extras 1994-2004)","text":" California's Coachella Valley receives an average annual rainfall of about six inches. Palm Desert's own Aberdeen, however, have weathered some storms making twee pop for gray afternoons. Core duo Beth Arzy and John Girgus met in high school in the early 1990s, formed a band, and fell in love. Soon they formed a new band, named it for Scotland's thirdlargest city (avg. rainfall ~32 inches), and recorded several EPs and singles for the Sarah and Sunday labels. The couple and thus, the group split rather rancorously by early 1996, but reunited musically six years later for a fulllength debut, Homesick & Happy to Be Here, and three further singles. Plus, they appeared on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\".If Homesick & Happy to Be Here was the album Arzy and Girgus never made when they were in love, What Do I Wish for Now? is the singles compilation their band's catalog has always demanded. Spanning from the Field Miceinfluenced drummachine indie of 1994's Byron EP (which Girgus has since called \"garbage\") to the bigsky California miserabilism of last year's Florida EP, this 18track collection shows the scars of growing up, emotionally and aesthetically. Out of their internal tensions, Aberdeen craft tender, intimate indie pop; from their Mojave origins, they conjure foggy downpours, looming thunderclaps, and shortlived rainbows. John Peel made fun of them, and now he's dead.Aberdeen's work divides neatly into pre and postbreakup, but lilting melodies and dreamy, percolating guitars remain constant. So, too, does a Richard Linklaterian sense of realities just barely out of reach. \"Sometimes I feel things might be good this way,\" Arzy muses in a quiet head voice on languid \"When It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" (from 1995's Fireworks EP), \"but then I feel it was the rain.\" From the same EP, titletrue \"Super Sunny Summer\" gets lovelorn over translucent guitars befitting contemporaries Rocketship.Years later, \"Sink or Float\" finds the band sounding like a polished, Los Angeleno Camera Obscura, but still aflutter with goosebumps: \"I feel as if I've never had a crush before.\" A straightforward cover of the Field Mice's \"Emma's House\" with Girgus on vocals seems unnecessary, though it's a good reminder that Arzy is also a member of Trembling Blue Stars. Indeed, most recent single \"Florida\" shares the New Ordertinged foreboding of Robert Wratten's current troupe. \"Something in the way that you left me made me want to throw it all away,\" Girgus admits.Like Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, Aberdeen's What Do I Wish for Now? is a glimpse into a fractured romance, though its pleasures are more reverie than voyeurism. The disc brings together all Aberdeen's singles and EPs, plus three compilation rarities, but Aberdeen initiates will still want to seek out Homesick & Happy to Be Here for album cuts like stringafloat \"Homesick\" and equally buoyant \"Handsome Drink\" (one of the \"Buffy\" tracks). Together or apart, Arzy and Girgus are at their best when they channel their drizzly English inspirations through their own southern California sensibilities. And overhead, there's not a cloud that couldn't once have been skywriting. "}
