Now we have Scottish Fiction highlights from the band's first decade. If you're a longtime fan of Idlewild it's not a necessary purchase there's no new material, nor even any of their rare early singles (the special edition comes with a bonus DVD that completists will undoubtedly want). But if you're new to them, this is a great introduction and a fantastic disc, drawing substantially from each of their albums. For others, this is a convenient onestop for all the Idlewild you'll ever need. The song choices are mostly obvious, with just a few surprises, and by and large the selections make sense. I'd have taken \"I'm Happy to Be Here Tonight\" off their 1998 debut Hope Is Important rather than the mundane \"I'm a Message\", but otherwise this truly is their best stuff. It's sequenced for flow, but chronology isn't terribly important when you're compiling a band like Idlewild their sound varied a bit over the years, but not to the point where there are any jarring transitions. The biggest differences occur between their first and second albums. Hope Is Important captured a wouldbe punk band before it realized it was better suited to playing brainy poprock. Vocalist Roddy Woomble sounds nasal and thin on their earliest material, and \"When I Argue I See Shapes\" works mostly because of its tunefulness, a quality they'd soon go on to more fully embrace. By the time of their second album, 2000's 100 Broken Windows, Woomble had found his voice, building memorable songs out of references to Gertrude Stein and madeup words like \"Roseability\" or \"discourage\" used as a noun. Though the band abandoned thrashy threechord punk, they became more muscular. \"Roseability\", in particular, has a very strong rhythm track, juxtaposed with a light vocal melody and some excellent harmonies.  2002's The Remote Part is justly the most represented album on the disc, with five tracks. I'm a little surprised by the inclusion of \"In Remote Part/Scottish Fiction\", but the keyboardled \"You Held the World in Your Arms\" is undeniable, a punchy surge that still sounds vital. And then there's \"American English\", perhaps their most sublime track and an effortless anthem with drummer Colin Newton's strange march beat heightening the sense of upward motion. Woomble's assertion to whoever he's talking to, \"You've contracted American dreams,\" is an interesting and subtle assertion that perhaps the American Dream is more akin to a virus than something to aspire to.  The band's two most recent albums haven't been quite as good as The Remote Part, but they've had their moments. \"Love Steals Us From Loneliness\", from 2005's Warnings/Promises, finds the band poking fun at their own poetic pretensions on the chorus: \"You said something stupid like 'love steals us from loneliness'/ Happy birthday/ Are you lonely yet?\" That album's \"I Understand It\" is among their most ambitious moments, with big choral vocals, a bit of an electronic hitch in the rhythm track and generally big production. Make a New World only gets a couple of representatives including \"No Emotion\", a great flirtation with dancepunk and that album's clear standout. Idlewild have yet to make an album without at least a bit of filler, and on these newer records there's more of it than ever before. As such, this compilation is a fine entry point to their catalog, and a good way to gage whether you want to go any deeper.  "}
