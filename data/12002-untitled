{"label":" Def Jam","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/12121/homepage_large.083c6d6c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Nas","title":"Untitled","text":" I'd hate to confuse correlation with causation, but the 18 months since Hip Hop Is Dead have gone a long way towards proving Nas wrong. Graduation and Tha Carter III showed that challenging mainstream artists can still produce genuine Billboard blockbusters, the avantgarde has been wellrepresented by stellar releases by DÃ¤lek, Subtle, and ElP (amongst others), and Jay Electronica (producer of the astounding intro \"Queens Get the Money\") and Wale have emerged as exciting new voices with promising commercial prospects. Even Nas seems to have gotten the message this year, producing an excellent 21stcentury record that balances political powder kegs, audacious Escobar floss raps, complementary beats, and genuine inspiration. Unfortunately, that record was the far superior DJ Green Lantern Presents: The Nigger Tape (whose songs are sadly underrepresented here), not Untitled.Not that it's going to matter. Whether Nas intended to actually follow through with his incendiary, original album title, he's been treating his own selffulfilling martyrdom as the record's main goal. (See the claim on \"Hero\": \"Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce, and Billy Joel they can't sing what's in they soul/ So Untitled it is/ I never changed nothing.\") Whatever the unfettered vision for the record, through masterful PR work, Nas has given ample reason for listeners to blame everyone but himself for his most cynical and arguably worst album yet. At least Nastradamus was up front about being a shitty crossover bid.The most frustrating thing is that this could have been a solid record. But now, how is Nas going to come off like he intended Untitled to be an unflinching look at race relations and yet somehow leave off the track he did with stic.man? Worse still, the righteous message of \"Association\" (strength through interaction with those who inspire you) is forsaken for the stilted, spokenword ramblings of \"Testify\", in which Nas accuses white downloaders of being unwilling to \"ride\" with him for whatever reason. And what about the hallucinogenic \"Esco Let's Go\", where he fantasized about \"[writing] hood movies like Posse and Five Heartbeats\" while summoning Elizabeth Taylor for career advice? Instead, we get an elderly German rhyming \"knotty head\" with \"Nazi sled\" (\"America\"), \"Breathe\" and its boring consumption rhymes (\"First I cop/ Then I yacht\" do go on!), and the gutless \"Make the World Go Round\" in which Nas, Chris Brown, and Cool & Dre top even Fat Joe in terms of trendhopping insincerity, toasting to ballers, gangstas, hustlas, and the very same ringtone rappers he was willing to throw under the bus just two years ago when it was convenient for his public image.On Untitled you get to decide whether you prefer Nas thoroughly exploring halfassed concepts or halfassedly exploring thorough concepts. Note the distinction: Either he's missing obvious targets or hitting ones not worth aiming at. Peep \"Sly Fox\", a concerted attempt to be the \"She Watch Channel Zero?!\" for conservative news zombies, right down to its steady guitar chug. The main difference is that \"Channel Zero\" risked alienation by confronting its target head on, whereas when it comes to preaching to the choir and picking easy fights, Nas has no problem being the Morgan Spurlock of this rap shit. Speaking of rhymin' for the sake of riddlin' \"The Fox has a Bushy tail/ And Bush tells lies and Fox trots, so I don't know what's real.\" Which essentially means nothing.More successful is the Busta Rhymesfeaturing \"Fried Chicken\", which might actually be the record's strongest cut, but it doesn't take the expected route of cultural subtext, instead working the blues trope of female/food personification. But immediately after, you get the perspective piece \"Project Roach\", and in case Nas' verses somehow went over your head, a Last Poet intones, \"Niggas is like roaches/ We're never gonna go away.\" Just because you understand him, it don't mean that he's nice, and just to make sure you're even more confused once the record finally ends, he precedes the suspiciously fencesitting Obama song (\"Black President\") with \"We're Not Alone\", a cashedbowl musing on extraterrestrial life.As anyone who has followed Nas in the past decade knows, you're not here for the beats. Though he's never been hesitant to enlist the trendiest producers, they're rarely inspired to step up their game; here, it's obvious what the difference is between secondrate Timbaland tracks and something from the new line of popsavvy superproducers. Particularly in the first half, Untitled is turned into Vice City, where each hired gun coats their tracks with ugly layers of polyester drums, fluorescent synths, and aimless violence. You can distinctly hear Polow Da Don buying into his own hype on \"Hero\", ignoring Nas as a lead instrument and bombing out the mix with pinwheeling keyboard arpeggios and obtrusive unison bends. On previous listens, \"N.I.G.G.E.R. (The Slave and the Master)\" sounded like the record's centerpiece and DJ Toomp's honest approximation of the fat cat lounginess of American Gangster. But check its tinny string section and punchless snares backtoback with \"Say Hello\", and Toomp's trying to make it rain with nickels.Though many view Illmatic as the gold standard for hiphop albums, it's abundantly clear that Nas is better off doing anything but trying to recreate it. His best work of the past decade ironically goes against the very concept of traditional albummaking (The Lost Tapes, The Nigger Tape). When caught up in the increasingly antiquated promotional cycle, Nas is more likely to rely on ugly manipulation of people who tend to care way more about his work than he apparently does, and accomplish the exact opposite of what he presumptively set out for see how Stillmatic took advantage of those who needed to believe that it had equal footing with The Blueprint (illustrated by The Source's hilariously opportunistic 5mic rating). See how HipHop Is Dead took advantage of people willing to believe that Nas had anything trenchant to say about a game that increasingly sounded like it didn't need him anymore. Thanks to about a halfhour's worth of music made nearly 15 years ago, Nas will never lack a following, and the press battles surrounding Untitled will keep his name hot enough so we can do the same thing all over again in 2010, when he announces the release of his new album, McCain Killa.
