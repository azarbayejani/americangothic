{"label":" Last Gang","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/10415/homepage_large.8e827492.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Eric Harvey","artist":"Bang Lime","title":"Best Friends in Love","text":" Bang Lime's bassist/singer Joshua Winstead and drummer Joules ScottKey met a decade and a half ago in Denton, Texas, and have traveled and played together ever since. The duo's most noteworthy stop: Serving as the rhythm section for Metric. Emily Haines' group isn't especially innovative, but after sitting through several passes of Best Friends in Love, its creative core comes into sharp relief (it's the other two, by the way). This record is profoundly conservative, comprised of dirty postpostpunk pastiche, clich√©d sentiment, and barely disguised amateurism. Bang Lime make the sort of music that might find its way on to a blanketlicense production music compilation, to be used by editors looking to score a lowbudget, straighttoDVD film scene in a Brooklyn club. In 2004. Julian Casablancas and Paul Banks themselves have proffered some of the past decade's clunkiest lyrical sentiment, but they're still palatable at least, enmeshed as they are in clouds of glassy, authenticseeming disillusion. Winstead has no such excuse, though: His simplistic urbanexistence narratives not only neglect any semblance of nuance in favor of thuddingly boring couplets, they register as completely unironic. \"Kings and Queens\" has \"Get a little bit closer/ It's your spell that I'm under,\" and \"The Death of Death\" opens with \"Oh, do you ride on the subway/ And wait all night for the love train.\" \"Angie thinks she's 17 years old,\" we learn on \"Fly Paper\", before finding out she's \"a small insect, soon to rule the world.\" Oh wait, one more, from \"Equator\": \"Follow your fingers/ Touch leather/ Unbuckle his belt line/ A foreign pleasure.\" Effective subtitles for a poorlytranslated easternEuropean escort service? Sure. Both \"Sailing\", about the slave trade, and \"Free White & 21\", which is about, um, being that, ostensibly allow Winstead, an AfricanAmerican, to address the issue of race. A dicey proposition, given his propensity to avoid subtlety at every turn. On \"21\" Winstead repeats the phrase \"innocent and free,\" sounding so much like a stock Jack Black character mugging for the camera. \"Sailing\", the guitars of which very closely resemble Ministry's \"Breathe\", is probably the closest thing Best Friends in Love comes to a success, the lyric \"Threefifths of a man! That don't add up to much!\" notwithstanding. Winstead's feelings for the song, expressed in a recently published interview, probably reveal the truth about his own investment in his work: \"It's basically about the slave trade...I think it's hilarious.\" Yow. If he's not taking it seriously, why should we? "}
