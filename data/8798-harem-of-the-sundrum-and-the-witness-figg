It's a fucking epidemic. Since Devendra Banhart shepherded his golden apples onto one collection, indie rockers have had time to growout their hair/grizzled beards and practice some Vashti Bunyan/John Fahey tablature. So, unless you have a desire to purchase everything even vaguely arboreal or fingerpicky, separating the raw and the cooked can be difficult. A fresh breeze from Knoxville, Tennessee (for the time being, he says), James Toth aka Wooden Wand plays somber folk with smoky, chickencoop ambiance. Sticking with the basics, his unadorned sound consists of guitar and voice: Singing into your ear, he whispers and caws over splintery strums. Now and again, his voice lifts like a hillbilly choir or a candlelit revival presided over by David Crosby. He mumbles. He exorcises and laments. He goes Bill Callahan on us. Hardly a naive backwoodsman, exGolden Calves player Toth is the leader of upstart Brooklyn (and elsewhere) freefolk vagabonds, the Vanishing Voice. He also cooperates Polyamory Records with fellow exCalve and currentDead Machines tone bender Tovah O'Rourke, wife of Wolf Eyes' John Olson. Regardless of Toth's experimental pedigree, Harem of the Sundrum and the Witness Figg runs in a different direction than his alloverthemap work with the Vanishing Voice (though you can hear hints of their thing in the opening flangefest of loopy \"Warn Winch, Pts. 23\"). That's the surprise and joy of this record: Not just adept at improvisation, Toth proves a strong, subtle songwriter. The selfreleased cassette Harem of the Sundrum appeared last year, but this is a longer, fuller set. Toth sites inspiration as Grace Slick, Gene Clark, Fleetwood Mac, and John Phillips, but if you want it in laid out in zeitgeist terms, it's way less quirky than Banhart, could be compared to Wovenhand doing some California, bluesky dreaming. It snaps and crackles: Once in a good while, he has a strange Tom Petty pronunciation and conjures Bastard Generals, but play it safe and drop lofidelity Roky Erickson. The pieces establish a doleful sort of inspiration. \"Leave Your Perch...\" is a downer with soft, Grateful Dead guitar noodles bobbing over icy, shadowy strum and phaser humming like a firefly. \"Perch Modifier\" explicitly states some of the album's religious themes (God, angels, a bird singing \"weak, rejoice, the day is new\") and Toth's connection to landscape: \"Look up to the clouds/ Do you ever look past your boots and onto the ground?/ Do you ever think back to when you were very small?/ That's when you didn't need to rule over all.\" The vocals double for the last line and the guitar pickings grow intricate, briefly, as if his heart's aflutter. A moderately upbeat spiritual, \"Vengeance, Pt. 2\" speaks of end times (Toth is sure he'll see all his friends and so he has \"nothing to fear\") and includes lovely barroom harmonizing for the curious, catchy line: \"Play your phonograph, it still makes baby laugh.\" \"Sundrum Ladies\" feels like Stranger Than Paradise scored by M. Ward, focusing on the Louisiana sky, more babies, and some ragged, jittery (but hushed) soloing. Reminiscent of Pink Mountaintops' truckstop literock blues, \"(Ask a) Sufist Chef\" imbibes in dancing skeletons, a blind magician (\"he mistook a lizard for a rabbit and scared the children senseless\"), and various \"miraculous things.\" It ends with the refrain: \"We should be with God without attachment.\" Toth acts movetothecountry Smog circa Julius Caesar on \"Spiritual Inmate\" and rolls into woodpanelling falsetto on \"Eagle Claw\", where things grow ominous over the chilled Nashville skyline: \"Don't let your time pass you by.../ Don't save your last words 'til you die.\" But, weirdly, the song actually sparkles. These lofi hymns succeed because they're highly listenable. The collecton's direct, unadorned, honest, idiosyncratic. Like neofolk's most interesting players (Banhart, Ben Chasny, Joanna Newsom), Toth sounds more like his precursors than his contemporaries, and very much like himself. Timeless is a tough (even questionable) word to plunk down on the present, but all things considered (and considered carefully), Harem of the Sundrum and the Witness Figg should sound especially singular this time next year, even if Toth goes and gets himself a buzz cut.
