{"label":" self-released","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/18488/homepage_large.caf14c8f.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andy O'Connor","artist":"Car Bomb","title":"w^w^^w^w","text":" You'd be forgiven for thinking that New York experimental metal quartet Car Bomb were a Meshuggah tribute band. The interplay between guitarist Greg Kubacki and drummer Elliot Hoffman does feature a lot of that tight mechanical syncopation that Meshuggah have made a career out of. That conjoined gunfire staccato is unmistakable. There are imitators, and there are groups who understand the essence, the soul of a group and build upon that distinctive sound. Car Bomb fall in the latter group. Centralia, Car Bomb's debut from 2007, displayed the Meshuggah influence greatly, and while it's still prevalent on their new selfreleased record, w^w^^w^w (pronounced “w click w”), Car Bomb are branching out and becoming their own group.  Car Bomb always had a \"catchy\" dimension, but it gets to breathe more on w^w^^w^w. Vocalist Michael Dafferner is largely responsible, as he has a voice for radio but also plays in an extreme metal group. Dafferner's \"woos!\" at the beginning and end of \"Finish It\" suggest a playfulness not found in their comparably harsh, but less flexible peers. Some of the best technical groups, like Rush, Nomeansno, and many of Frank Zappa's lineups, let the listener know that despite their wideranging influences and knowledge of theory, they can still be pretty silly guys at heart. Car Bomb aren't as cheeky, but there are still shades of absurdity that can elicit a chuckle or two. On closing track \"The Seconds\", the band has never been more accessible. Like most of the songs, it leads off with the dependable robotic attack, then 2:04 hits and you might think you've stumbled upon a lost Deftones chorus. \"Seconds\" eventually breaks into Kubacki employing acoustic guitars under the electric chords building, almost as if the album needed an ambient section. There are similar Deftonesesque moments on \"Magic Bullet\" and \"Lower the Blade\", more songs that could exist in a parallel universe alternativerock station. Still, these clean vocal parts sound alien and foreign amongst all the clanging and slamming. It's not as if the band is hesitant to utilize less abrasive sounds, they just mold them to fit with the overall chaotic, futuristic nature of their compositions. For all their advancements toward accessibility, the pounding lockstep rhythms are still the core of the band, and w^w^^w^w ranks among the year's most unrelenting records. \"The Sentinel\" immediately bombards you with that chokehold; there's no premonition to prepare you for what's to come. Those rhythms carry the majority of the record. Car Bomb have cited IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) as an influence, and Kubacki's leads are the most readily apparent aspect of this. His Digitech Whammy abuse is best manifested on the lead breaks on \"Sentinel\", which sound like lasers becoming selfaware with bloodlust, and the nearly trancelike soloing on \"This Will Do the Job\". Vinnie Vincent Invasion boasted on their selftitled album that no synthesizers were used, but Car Bomb go for the more impressive feat of making electronicesque sounds with standard metal instrumentation. Excess might seem to be the order of the day to the lazy ear, but there's an economy to the music, and not just in the 50second \"AutoNamed\". There's a lot of noise, but it's always just the right amount. At 50 minutes, you know they've got more to say, but they'll leave that for another record. Car Bomb started off on Relapse but didn't quite get the attention that label tends to garner. Whether or not the group's musical growth is tied to their breakoff with Relapse, they clearly did not need the label's support to make such progress. Meshuggah were on Ozzfest once; Car Bomb may get a shot at Rockstar Mayhem if things play out like that. "}
