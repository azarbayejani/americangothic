Their lyrics stressed both punk principles and emotional outpourings. Their music was furious but catchy, with a set of mannerisms that flowed smoothly into indierock, poppunk, and altrock: palmmuted power chords laced with bright octaves and harmonics; guitar leads rounding off into whistling feedback; countermelodic bass lines; and epic breakdowns with arty sampled monologues. They had lofty ideals, but their songs walked around on the streets, sullen and pissed, with fresh scabs and dogeared volumes of Bukowski in their back pockets.The phrase \"emocore\" itself is a problematic compromise between hardcore and pop an angstinducing identity for a young band. Blake Schwarzenbach was 22 when Jawbreaker's 1990 debut, Unfun, came out, and this was but one of the pressures that drove him. Recriminating tunefully through a shredded throat, he calibrated himself against a punk scene and adult world of coequal injustice. Unfun was Jawbreaker's punkest record, but he feared it wasn't punk enough: \"Sorry we ain't hard enough to piss your parents off,\" he snipped on \"Incomplete\". His fretful intelligence often led him to dispense free psychological evaluations and strawman parables. There are many issuesbased songs: \"Softcore\" is antiporn, and \"Seethruskin\" is antiracism. It gets almost Orwellian: \"Don't think that I ain't counting all the things you do,\" Schwarzenbach bristles in scenecop mode. (He always loved those sassy \"ain'ts.\") To that extent, the record earns its title.Yet the music itself is irrepressibly fun. Drummer Adam Pfahler was a fucking behemoth, a whiz with galloping toms and breathtakingly long fills. He sounds great on this lowend boosted reissue, which, on CD and download, also includes the formative Whack & Blite EP. And Schwarzenbach's prickliness was ultimately sympathetic, because it stemmed from a vulnerability he laid bare in songs like \"Want\", where dark secrets are exorcised in the name of love. \"So now you know where I come from,\" he sings, underlining it twice for emphasis: \"My secret's come undone/ My heart reveals my cause.\" The world is fallen, but he's not dancing on the wreckage. He's looking for survivors, imploring on \"Busy\", \"We're all close to the end; don't you need a friend?/ Honor your allegiances!\"By 1995's majorlabel but stillfierce swan song, Dear You, Jawbreaker seemed wholly out of step with the scene that revered them; a broken lineage made painfully clear by the terrible cover versions modern emo bands produce. Schwarzenbach managed one pretty great album with Jets to Brazil, Orange Rhyming Dictionary, before petering out into mojoless soft rock. With reunion and documentary rumors rumbling, Jawbreaker is primed for renewed attention, though one wonders what emo fans raised on Dashboard Confessional, Warped Tour, and Vagrant Records will make of their pinched, petulant sound. Regardless, the original music stands tall. On Unfun, Jawbreaker's conviction that punk could open up to pop while staying hardcore burns more urgently than ever, in the retrospective light of futility. "}
