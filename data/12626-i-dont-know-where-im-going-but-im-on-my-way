Deusner","artist":"Murry Hammond","title":"I Don't Know Where I'm Going But I'm on My Way","text":" I wonder which came first for Murry Hammond, his fascination with trains or his love of country music. Locomotives have inspired scores of country and western songs from \"Waiting for a Train\" to \"Let the Train Blow the Whistle\", which have made them metaphors for loneliness, wanderlust, death, freedom, imprisonment, and so on and so forth. Possibly only zombies have more allegorical potential. Hammond's dayjob band, the Old 97s, is named after a train song (\"Wreck of the Old 97\"), and his first album as a solo artist, I Don't Know Where I'm Going But I'm on My Way, is a collection of originals and mostly covers that employ trains as vehicles for a spiritual journey, casting life's tribulations (Hammond's: the death of his father, the hard times in the Old 97s) as treacherous mountain passes and arduous treks along miles of tracks until it reaches a heavenly destination. It can be heavy listening, but Hammond's ear for odd, droning soundscapes, his fondness for shuffling brushedsnare beats, and his liberal take on old songs lend it a sense of real discovery.This is an album steeped in history, but not beholden to it. Hammond takes liberties with these tunes, showing himself to be a curious sonic tinkerer. In retrospect, he seems an underutilized presence in the Old 97s, where he is overshadowed by frontman Rhett Miller. But I Don't Know Where I'm Going sounds more musically adventurous than anything that band has ever done, despite Hammond's reliance on traditional tunes. The album opens with Texas jackleg preacher George Washington Phillips' \"What Are They Doing in Heaven Today?\", which Hammond turns into a Jimmie Rodgersstyle yodel. The Carter Family's \"I Never Will Marry\" descends from Appalachia for a high lonesome sound that's as flat as a Texas plain, and Hammond draws three train songs (\"Life Is Like a Mountain Railroad\", \"You Will Often Meet Obstruction\", \"As You Roll Across the Trestle\") from a work by renowned Mormon poet Eliza R. Snow. But his greatest risk may be the \"Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down\" triptych, which begins as an instrumental performed on a homemade kit banjo, transforms into a strange reading of scripture (man's prayer in one ear, God's answer in the other), and ends as a stalwart reading of the hymn.Covers dominate the album, nodding to countrymusic and railroad history, but Hammond includes a few originals that stand up alongside his best work with the 97s (namely, \"Valentine\" and \"Crash on the Barrelhead\"). \"Wreck of the 97\" is a pensive account of tough times in that band, with Hammond's vocal phrasing rushing the song forward at a pace just shy of reckless. I Don't Know Where I'm Going closes with two of his best compositions: \"Other, Younger Days\" places a majorkey acoustic guitar over a droning harmonium (recalling his track on the Teach Me to Sing compilation) to create a sense of wideopen space, with Hammond's vocals drenched in reverb, and on the spare \"I Believe, I Believe\" his high, keening yodel so searching earlier in the album sounds contented and fulfilled, as if he has finally reached the end of the line.
