Shawn Bosler","artist":"Danzig","title":"The Lost Tracks of Danzig","text":"  Oh, you little devil, you. Chill man, we're not derogatorily speaking of the diminutive devilman Glenn Danzig, but rather those \"little devil\" triads that so cleverly, in a poof of brimstone, seem to magically appear any time a darkleaning rock and/or metal artist churns out a diabolical jam. Ever since Tony Iommi branded the world with his ominous tritone threenote riff at the front of the Satansummoning \"Black Sabbath\", you find those same \"evil sounding\" progressions all throughout the bedrock of heavymetal and quite notably sprinkled all about the popmetal arcana of Danzig. Glenn Danzig needs no introduction, the dude is legend: From his origins as the devillocked Undead Elvis frontman for the Misfits and Samhain up through his bluesmetal, hellish comic book romps under his given name, the dude has been the oneman soundtrack to outsiderteen angst and cartoon occult flirtations for three decades. One explanation for his durability may be that the sixteenyearold brain responds obediently to demon and devil talk. This new double album features a collection of lost tracks and outtakes or tracks that Glenn felt didn't fit thematically from throughout his entire career: From his classic first four strobelit, stripperpole grinding, titaniumblues strutting albums, through his midtolate 90s missteps into industrial and electronica territories, all the various styles are represented warts and all. The warts would be OK, if there just weren't so many of 'em. A carefully chosen single album that would've had the devillocked denizens drooling 'til the cracking of the seventh seal winds up being a flabby, overstuffed warehouse of unnecessary notasgoodastheoriginal tunes. Those who worship epic fistpumping headbangers like \"Twist of Cain\", \"Her Black Wings\", \"Brand New God\", and \"Dirty Black Summer\" from the first four records will experience eartoearsmiling déjà vu when they hear previouslyunreleased counterparts such as the awesome boogie bashin' \"Pain Is Like An Animal\" or the killer dirgey, bluesy swaying \"When Death Had No Name\".  But when a bloated cavalcade of PVC corset/meshed halfshirt/Herman Munsterboot wearing gothmetalindustrial whatzits sizzle past, followed by the useless cover of Bowie's \"Cat People\", one might be fully bummed if they'd paid the full cover charge. Thankfully, a few Zeppeliny, classic Danzig bluesy ballads (\"Dying Seraph\" and \"Crawl Across Your Killing Floor\"), a groovin' TRex cover (\"Buick Mackane\"), and a catchy darkpop tune called \"Warlok\" help split the difference between the great and the stinky. Overall, a good argument for iTunes. But seriously, the keepers are down right essential! "}
