{"label":" Ninja Tune","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/3103/homepage_large.4b0ba010.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Dan Lett","artist":"Fog","title":"Hummer EP","text":" Although hardly as shocking as the John Carpenter film, Fog is as unsettling and about as ambiguous. But a more fitting cinematic comparison may lie in the noir expressionism of David Lynch's Eraserhead. Like that film, Hummer follows a staticheaded, haunted protagonist as he struggles with alienation, naivety and a disjointed otherworldliness, mirroring Lynch's fondness for subtle humor and shaky delirium.Hummer also betrays the mundanity of its title, challenging you to feel at ease within its seven uncomfortable, nagging creations. If you're familiar with Fog's selftitled debut or last year's Ether Teeth, this disc's twisted pop mechanics and freakshow instrumentation may not be so jarring; if you're not, Andrew Broder's capricious approach to arrangement and continuity may take some adjusting to. In either case, you should find Hummer as uneven as it is fascinating but then, the EP has always been the most sensible medium on which artists can spill their temporary departures and outlandish experiments. Fog has never courted cashregister acclaim, but this release seems intent on proving its \"difficult\" credentials by almost instantly pulling the musical guts out of its fledgling opener, \"Whom That Hits Walls\". Broder does get around to laying down a droning, thumping dirge after a short while, but then takes a knife to it as well, before finally allowing the song to limp out in a thrashing tantrum. It's a technique that recalls the kind of artsy selfsabotage Sonic Youth employed on Washing Machine's \"The Diamond Sea\", which similarly operated more as an understated glimpse of talent than a cacophony designed to mask a deficiency of it. \"I, Baby\" marries the kiddyspeak of Nick Cave's \"All the Pretty Little Horses\" with stark piano and a hushed vocal delivery. Although Broder's decision to tack a 'Y' onto the end of every line (\"When I grow uppy/ Me get strongy/ Me lifty/ See me strongy\") can be grossly irritating, the damaged vocalizing and awkwardly outofsync phrasing asks us to see the simple pleas beyond the seemingly gimmicky vehicle. The track clatters out in a potsandpans shuffle, stirring a poignant current that flows through the rest of the EP. On later tracks, his streamofconsciousness approach holds up to scrutiny, rarely sounding too indulgent or trite. Although the technique fails to provide a tangible narrative or resolution, songs like \"Melted Crayon\" and \"Stink of Kings\" paint an even deeper sense of fragility and foreboding than Broder's usual fare. On \"Melted Crayon\", in particular, a strong undercurrent of menace permeates Broder's gentle acoustics: \"I must have strange glasses on/ I must have taken strange poison,\" he sings, before perverting the images of childhood in lines like, \"Drink melted crayons for me/ Drink every crayon in the box,\" and gurgling to a stringswaddled close that hints at a quiet madness.Hummer evades easy classification due to Broder's overambitious nature and general lack of cohesion the disc dips as heavily into leftfield electronics as it does indie pop but, wisely eschewing a traditional coherence and fully embracing the odd rhythms of his mind, Broder presents an uncompromising vision that could have hideously backfired. The EP's centerpiece, \"Cockeyed Cookie Pusher\", acts as a microcosm for the entire EP: It is beautifully sung and deftly arranged, but oh what a silly title. "}
