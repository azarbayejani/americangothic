Thankfully Hrishikesh Hirway traveled, crosscountry and even to India, embarking late on one of those somber searchingforyourself Wanderjahres. From this Ivy Leaguer you might expect a strain of clever selfflagellation falling, in his own words, \"somewhere between bedroom electronica and singer/songwriter.\" But Hirway's music, performed with violinist Jane Yakowitz under the name The One AM Radio, isn't so cutanddry. Like MÃºm on a smaller scale, or a lightly medicated, looselipped Four Tet, his introspective songs sway hazily from image to metaphor, between yesterday's folk and tomorrow's digitalism. Where 2004's A Name Writ in Water flirted with confession, his third fulllength This Too Will Pass verges on pure autobiography, a microsaga of vagabonding and unraveling romance. For a diary in sound, this leans heavily on that old shortcut to immediacy: the secondperson. But despite all the youthis and youthat, Hirway never sounds bitter; he's not pointing fingers. \"You still felt the same, you said,\" he sings on \"In the Time We've Got\", strangely impassive. \"But a longing crept into the eyes I'd known.\" Shepherding us like a tour guide through his own memory, he recites without regret, reports without passing judgment. Of course, the ubiquitous \"you\" is a past lover. Echoes of faraway percussion evoke their growing emotional distance, in \"Lest I Forget\", as recent grief starts chipping away at their relationship. \"You lost too much too fast,\" he consoles her. As the next verse concludes, the line changes to \"You changed so much so fast.\" Hirway handles these classic, easily fumbled themes with rare grace. It could have been a mawkish wreck \"the words I don't love you anymore,\" the drowningsaving trope, the oversold tragedy but \"Cast Away\" elegantly recreates the dullness of icedover love, of being somewhere only physically, lost in either a sleepless funk or dreams \"of the same underwater scene/ Where you nearly made your peace.\"  Hirway mines dreams and nature to telegraph a range of complicated feelings. On \"In the Time We've Got\" he turns a few scenes, with changingseasons symbolism, into a collage about foreseeing The Split. \"You had the city in you,\" Hirway sighs on the chorus, draping the whole affair with starcrossed resignation. The ache of recent events has at least for this moment undone him, reversing what seemed on Writ like a forkintheroad decision to embrace his Tamborellolite, electronic side. He also scales back the flowery emo lyricism that marred that effort. This album is folk to the bone, raw and selfemptying in the vein of Elliott Smith's Roman Candle. But in merely reciting and reporting, Hirway assumes not Smith's wounded whisper, all radiance and suffering, but a sleepy detachment, as if the trauma numbed him or time healed him. Accents of hope streak this anthology on loneliness: The golden days may pass, as the title reminds us, but so will the hard times.  "}
