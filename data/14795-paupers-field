{"label":" Rough Trade","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15872/homepage_large.3ecdd7a4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joshua Klein","artist":"Dylan LeBlanc","title":"Paupers Field","text":" Dylan LeBlanc was born in 1990 a lifetime past the peak of FAME studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. That's where his dad, country singer James LeBlanc, regularly cut sessions and also where young Dylan got an early musical education. You don't hear much Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, or Wilson Pickett in LeBlanc's assured debut, Paupers Field, though let alone many of the dozens of other country, soul, or rock acts that recorded down there. You do, however, hear a depth of experience somewhat at odds with LeBlanc's age, his sad voice prematurely scarred with regret and haunted by demons (drugs and alcohol reportedly played a role). This palpable darkness helps what could have otherwise been another runofthemill Americana disc rise above anonymity, its evocative textures and atmosphere a welcome respite from too many milquetoast troubadours.Paupers Field draws its name from the place where the poor were buried, and LeBlanc has likened his songs to headstones commemorating \"things that have died in my life.\" Given such a heavy outlook, it's no shock the compelling intimacy of songs such as \"5th Avenue Bar\", \"Emma Hartley\", and \"Death of Outlaw Billy John\" resonates in a way that doesn't exactly foster passive background listening. A great storyteller, LeBlanc draws you deep into the world he's depicting you can practically smell the decay  but for those few minutes there's nowhere else you'd like to be.Unlike so many masters of gloom and doom, though, LeBlanc doesn't lay it on so thick as to be claustrophobic. His daguerreotype songs actually sway and breathe, and while it's easy to dismiss the familiar signifiers the weeping lap steel, the ghostly reverb on the vocals, the presence of Emmylou Harris doing a guest turn on backing vocals it's harder to dismiss LeBlanc's potential. If this is what the guy's doing just out of his teens, it's anyone guess what life further lived will evince. Whether it turns out to be a crutch or a launch platform, Paupers Field definitely paves the path forward. "}
