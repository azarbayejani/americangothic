On 3, he was skidding dangerously postCarter III, whacked out on codeine and sounding frayed. Dedication 4, for its part, is the clearest transmission yet of a message he's been sending for a while: He'd rather not to be rapping anymore. From a beat selection so obvious that the word \"selection\" feels generous to Wayne's recycled punch lines to his unimaginative rhyme patterns, the mixtape is joyless clockpunching work from a rapper who has given some indications he doesn't even like his own music as much anymore. But a career's a career, and when you've gotten this famous, you don't just stop, even if maybe you'd prefer to. This is the spirit Dedication 4 comes to us in: Somehow, I don't think this is what 2005 Wayne meant when he promised us he'd only retire when he died. Not many rappers bother with this format anymore, in which a rapper flexes skill over a tape full of borrowed beats to point out how much better they are than the rappers that paid for them. Nonetheless, this is the sort of mixtape that elevated Wayne from \"famous rapper\" to \"legendary rapper.\" His freestyles over beats like \"Show Me What You Got\" and \"Shoulder Lean\" have become classics on their own. By contrast, Dedication 4 is a game of rap karaoke. The beats he raps over \"Same Damn Tune\", \"Burn\", \"Mercy\", \"Don't Like\", \"Amen\" are so ubiquitous that every rapper in the world looking for a quick SEO boost has spit some bars over them. Worse, Wayne falls immediately into the song's preexisting rhyme pattern, offering nothing to distract you from its source material: For a rapper so famous for stealing and murdering beats, the worst I can say about Dedication 4 is that there isn't one moment where I wouldn't rather be listening to the often mediocre originals. There are a dozen or so good punch lines scattered on D4, enough to make it fun enough for one listen: a good \"Jack Black/Jack White\" joke on \"Magic\", a \"straitjacket/straight jack it\" pun on \"Burn\". On \"Cashed Out\", he neatly unites his welldocumented Gremlins fixation to his sex fixation with the line, \"That pussy so wet, it turned into a Gremlin.\" Wayne doesn't sound depressed or detached here; he's still having fun, collapsing into giggles after dropping the LarrytheCableGuyworthy \"I would talk about my dick/ But that shit would be a long story.\" He just sounds uninspired, and in need of a new style. There are two surprising moments on Dedication 4: One is Nicki Minaj's hilarious fauxRomney endorsement on \"Mercy\" (if Minaj were actually to offer a Romney endorsement, I don't think the straightfaced line, \"I'm a Republican, voting for Mitt Romney,\" on a Lil Wayne mixtape would be her method). The other is when G Dep's \"Special Delivery\", of all things, shows up late on the mixtape. \"I don't even like this beat,\" Wayne mumbles playfully, before slipping in one of the tape's liveliest verses, dancing in and out of double time. It's one of the only verses that doesn't feel like a minimally tweaked update on something he said in 2007. Wayne has admitted lately that he's bored with rapping, reasonably pointing out, \"I've been doing it since I was eight and I'm about to be 30 in September... I think fans deserve a littletono Wayne. I've been everywhere.\" He's right. Let's hope Dedication 4 is the last we hear from Wayne for a while: We can wait until he has something to say before he approaches a mic again.  "}
