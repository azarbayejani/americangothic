Their selftitled 2007 debut deserves being mentioned in the same reverent breath as their onetime lablemates, the Exploding Hearts, as it has the same unabashed hero adulation and the same brash attempts at reaching those impregnable heights. Their overall sound never varies, with plentiful hooks and searing guitars that recall plenty of 1970s punk rockers and powerpoppers like the Buzzcocks and likely a dozen more obscure acts. There's no hoarse screaming, political posturing, or desperate panting from lead singer Ana McGorty; just a frontwoman who sings and acts like she belongs up front. There are only so many words to relay this record's spoton reverence, really; the relentless guitars, the harmonies, the treble, the echo, the energy they're all here, faithfully delivered and impeccably produced.The Busy Signals is a wellexecuted stab at punk rock comfort music. But within that triedandtrue formula, the band finds ample room for variation and surprise the album is consistent without ever getting homogeneous, and without really reveling in how exacting the songwriting is. \"Plastic Girl\" is a patchwork quilt dizzy from chord changes you'd never notice for its infectiousness and it's devilishly simple chorus, while \"Look the Other Way\" has slick singlenote guitar leads and a short cool down with bassist Jeremy Thompson (formerly of Carbonas) raising his voice before, yes, another great chorus. All the songs show that the devil is in the details: a windmilled chord up against a welltimed, economic lead; a sudden unaccompanied bass part that pivots and pushes; an boy/girl baton handoff vocal in \"Matter of Time\"; just an \"Oh\" or \"woahoh\" at the right moment. Songs like \"Matter of Time\" and \"Patterns\" are the most herocribbing, but stand ably on their own with clean, simple guitar lines that sound almost like Western soundtracks in how they wrangle and lead the song. But like many a band of spurned and jilted outcasts before them, the Busy Signals' bratty attitude lifts to reveal a bruised interior: the energy of the record hits first, but more listens reveal the hopeless romanticism of tracks like \"Tell Me\" or \"Kiss and Tell\", doowop laments in overdrive. One side of the band shakes out their troubles to instantlymemorable songs like \"Stereo\", the other gives tearyeyed relationship woes a pretty stirring soundtrack in their own right. Both sides are worth checking out and keeping tabs on, and, as McGorty sings \"young, young, young\" over and over in \"Patterns,\" they all sound like their unyielding enthusiasm will never dim.  "}
