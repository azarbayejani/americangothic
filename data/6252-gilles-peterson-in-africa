The world at large viewed him out of the corner of its eye throughout much of his life, fully realizing what it had lost when hundreds of thousands of people turned up at his funeral. Since that year, intrepid reissue labels, DJs, and archivists (not mention MCA/Universal) have leapt headfirst into the kaleidoscopic world of modern African music, turning up hundreds of lost and littleknown recordings. The excavation and display of vintage Afropop has been a treat for anyone who likes a good beat, though, and I suppose this makes Gilles Peterson's foray into Africa inevitable. Peterson is a venerable DJ and label owner, champion of a broad definition of dance music, and something of a tastemaker, who, according to the liners of this twodisc mix, first got into Fela and Manu Dibango back in the 80s. Gerry Lyseight's liners also try to subtly imply that Peterson himself has unearthed the Peter King and Letta Mbulu tracks included here, though I bet Russ Dewbury would have something to say about that. The oddest thing about Gilles Peterson in Africa is how far from the cutting edge it feels there's little here among the vintage tracks that I haven't heard before, presented more congruously on some other release, and a few of the remixes he includes on the second disc aren't terribly interesting or even au currant. That's not to say Peterson hasn't gathered a bunch of killer tracks. After a brief \"Intro\" (which is actually nicked from Oneness of Juju's \"African Rhythms\"), Peterson drops Oscar Sulley & the Uhuru Dance Band's astounding bigband funk cut \"Bukom Mashie\", a longunreleased track that's deservedly made the rounds of Afrobeat compilations since Soundway's Miles Cleret dusted it off a few years ago for Ghana Soundz. It's an outstanding track with a divebombing bassline and kingsized horns, but the presence of the brief, extraneous intro slightly clouds its impact. Most of Disc One, subtitled \"The Soul\", is solid, with relatively obscure picks from Fela and Dibango \"Ye Ye De Smell\" is an early Fela stomper typical of the awesome initial wave of Africa 70 recordings, Dibango's \"New Bell\" is sweet makossa funk. Peterson pulls Peter King's excellent \"Ajo\" from Harmless' outofprint AfricaFunk compilation and drops in a few of great South African tracks culled from Strut's similarly unavailable Club Africa discs, Miriam Makeba's \"Samba\" and Letta Mbulu's awesome Afrosoul track \"Mahlalela\", a stunning display of vocal virtuosity. South African jazz gets its day as well with \"Did You Hear that Sound\" by Abdullah Ibrahim (aka Dollar Brand), a dark ride on spare piano chords and splashy ride cymbal. A couple of outstanding Ethiojazz tracks occupy the middle of the disc and the style's inventor and master Mulatu Astatqe is represented on both. \"Mulatu\" is taken from his 1972 U.S.recorded LP Mulatu of Ethiopia and resembles a strippeddown version of his bestknown song, \"Netsanet\", while \"Asmarina\" is curiously attributed to Feqadu AmdeMesqel, though its original home was an LP called Yekatit\\xD0EthioJazz, credited to Mulatu Astatke featuring Fekadu Amde Maskal. AmdeMesqel is the song's author and his stunning flute playing dominates the track, but I still question the credit. Heading over to Disc Two (\"The Spirit\"), things are a little less even. OK, a lot less. I love what Masters at Work and Wunmi do on \"MAW Expensive (Tribute to Fela)\", mixing up the \"Expensive Shit\" groove and horn parts with Wunmi's impassioned reading of \"Upside Down\", Fela's brilliant protest of the imposition of European patrinomic systems on local African populations. The groove isn't as forceful in the hands of the Masters, but the looser, lighter edge plays better to a female vocalist than the Africa 70's militaristic onslaught. Otherwise, Congolese wrecking crew Konono No. 1's \"Lufuala Ndonga\" is still heavy as hell and hugely exciting, David Byrne & Thievery Corporation get nicely funky on \"The Heart's a Lonely Hunter\" and the \"High Life mix\" of Dennis Ferrer's \"Funu\" works nicely enough, but that's as far as I get on the second half of the set. Honestly, Carl Craig's remix of Cesaria Evora's \"Angola\" can't hold a children's birthday candle to the original, and Osborne's \"Afrika\" has a nice vocal, but a totally wooden club beat that doesn't make me want to dance nearly as much as the simple bassline of \"Bukom Mashie\". Overall, this a bunch of good tracks placed together in a manner that doesn't validate Peterson's reputation for impeccable sequencing, and a few tracks supposedly in the Afrobeat spirit that don't exactly measure up to the real thing. There's value here certainly, and if you're feeling like a little tourist jaunt into vintage Afropop, the first disc is a nice collection of good old songs, assembled in a decidedly touristic manner\\xD0the fact that a few of these tracks (read: \"Mahlalela\" and \"Mulatu\") are pretty hard to find elsewhere helps, too. If you're really looking for a solid, focused introduction to African popular music, though, there are plenty of better options, including MCA's Fela reissues, anything on Soundway or Strut (Strut stuff is out of print but available if you look around hard enough) and Buda Musique's Ethiopiques series.
