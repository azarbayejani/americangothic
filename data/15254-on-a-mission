{"label":" Columbia / Rinse","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/16362/homepage_large.2af3f3e4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Katy B","title":"On a Mission","text":" Last year, Katy B was widely credited for bringing vocal finesse and feminine pop appeal to an increasingly aggro dubstepcrossover arena. She dropped a fantastic Bengabacked debut single, \"Katy on a Mission\", that vocally wrung out both elation and longing over his abrasive, buzzing stutterstep. And she kept that streak going with a couple of guest spots on Magnetic Man's selftitled record: The eerie comeon \"Crossover\" and the ecstatic jungle throwback \"Perfect Stranger\" were album highlights that proved her voice could breach the barrier of heavyduty bass and plant its feet firmly atop it. Two UK top 5 hits later \"Katy on a Mission\" and the Ms. Dynamite collaboration \"Lights On\" and members of the English music press started to peg her as the next singer to bring crossover legitimacy to bass music. Turns out that'd be selling her a bit short. After pairing up with Rinse FM's tastemaker station head Geeneus and coproducer Zinc, Katy B has used On a Mission as a chance to posit herself as a genrespanning pop singer who isn't tied down to a single thing, no matter how well it suits her. It's a move that makes a lot of sense, since versatility is the key to a good dance album let the voice establish itself, and the niche will either find itself or get broadened in the process. \"Katy on a Mission\", \"Lights On\", and \"Perfect Stranger\" reappear here in radioedit lengths, and these three tracks help define her as someone who can play off dubstep and funky basslines with a tone that drips with cool defiance, stings with melancholy, and still grabs at you when it's being reduced to a skeletal echo. But there's enough stylistic extension here that Katy finds a way to transcend enough signifiers to call herself pop above anything else. The big standout here is \"Broken Record\", a fouronthefloor thump with electro underpinnings and a breakdown that perks up longtime dance fans with a judiciously dropped \"Amen\" break. It's one of those clubtested/radioready tracks that sounds good anywhere, not out of focusgrouped buttonpushing but the way Katy sells it: coyly yearning and melodically sweet on the verse, intense and swooping on the chorus, wracked with ambiguity throughout. And then she finds another gear when the song finally shifts into the titular hook near the end the way she rolls her delivery of the line \"likeabroken recooooord\" is the stuff that songlength buildups were made for. And there's more of that going around on the other new tracks, laid out in a number of different modes the trapped yet defiant punchback of opener \"Power on Me\", the sour resentment of \"Why You Always Here\", the slyly perilous seduction that drives \"Witches Brew\". It's a repertoire that gives her the appeal of a 1990s rave diva with contemporary popR&B refinement, minus the AutoTune. That alone would make her another noticeably talented if semianonymous vocalist. But she also provides a breather from pop's current fascination with vacant navelgazing. It's not just the nods to decadesold house and jungle that provide a perspective on dancemusic culture that predates the tyranny of the David Guetta era though Geeneus and Zinc get all the credit in the world for following up Katy's early breakthroughs with a firstrate collection of beats that reunite the disparate splinters of bass music culture past and present. What puts On a Mission over the top is Katy's way of expressing herself with emotions that extend past \"wooo, druuunk\" into more nuanced and detailed relationships with booming systems and the people who flock to them. As danceable as these tracks can be, the undercurrents of nuanced frustration and uncertainty in Katy's tone especially in the surrender of \"Power on Me\" and the tornup estrangement of \"Go Away\" amplify the tricky dynamics of relationships and hookups to rarefied levels, creating a tension to the music that makes epics out of dissatisfaction. And when she withdraws just a bit for one of the more introspective cuts, a haunting midtempo meditation on love and identity called \"Disappear\", her caughtup bewilderment says softly and resonantly what lesser singers couldn't accomplish with overblown histrionics. A genrebound narrative might still see Katy B slotted into a narrow role that can't quite contain her, but her voice is doing its best to prove otherwise. "}
