{"label":" Bpitch Control","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/2069/homepage_large.8d63e841.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Mark Pytlik","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Camping","text":" Last year, Cologne's Kompakt celebrated its onesheet centennial by having members of its roster remix cuts from its own back catalogue. That project was documented on the doubledisc set Kompakt 100, and although it wasn't the celebratory dancefloor melter that it probably should've been, its central selling point of hot usonus action felt tastefully in line with Kompakt's hermetically sealed sensibilities. If, as a label, you're more into the idea of creating a city than you are reflecting one, this is a good way of doing things. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Berlin's Bpitch Control, whose utilitarian and farreaching choices have probably come at the expense of a more streamlined label identity. That's not to say that Bpitch helmed and founded by German techno matriarch Ellen Allien hasn't been as discerning over the years, but rather that they've been more willing to branch out. Nowhere is that more evident than on the label's own celebratory retrospective, Camping. A simple mixandmatch of the best cuts from the label's discography, Camping showcases six years worth of permutations of Berlinesque techno and technopop. From the goofy basslines of Housemeister's \"Do You Wanna Funk\" and the gloopy vocodered pop of Smash TV's \"Sad\" to the razorsharp techno of Feadz' \"Lt Replay\" and the persistent glitch of Modeselektor's \"Don't Panic\", it pole vaults from one style to another, with only a steadfastly Germanic spirit holding it together. Fittingly, a few of the compilation's best cuts come from Allien herself. Even in their truncated forms, \"Wish\" and \"Sechsucht\" (two standouts from her excellent 2003 fulllength Berlinette) rank among the best things here. Other highlights include the widescreen disco synth stabs of Kiki's massivesounding 2002 single \"Luv Sikk\", the bizarro back porch flourishes of Hal 9000 & Sylvie Marks' recent \"Bl√ºtenspa\\xDF\", and the New Orderaping synthpop of Sascha Funke's smoldering 2001 cover of \"When Will I Be Famous\". Of course, there are some misfires here as well (Camping suffers from being a bit bottomheavy), but this is mostly a competent overview of Bpitch's healthy discography and a modest portrait of a label that has always been willing to go as far as Berlin has been willing to take it.
