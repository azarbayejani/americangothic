On his the Primary 5 debut, North Pole, he also aims to created dangerously infectious meadowpop. Here Quinn, with help from multiinstrumentalist Ryan Currie, among others, lays on more bluesky loveydove on the warmnotArctic North Pole. The Primary 5's sound, like the Fannies', is to keep it proper and indie Big Star, Sloan, the Raspberries. But more accurately, it's practically Gin Blossomy (albeit through the Clientele's classicist gauze). And that's not just because brilliant opener \"Comin' Home\" mentions \"gin\" and \"blossoms\" before announcing, plaintively but seeping with driblets of molten joy, \"I only want you here by my side.\" OK, so maybe \"honey you make me feel so good you're the girl I've waited for my whole life through you're the one\" on finale \"Field of Dreams\" breaches my Green Bayhat threshold. Banal lyrics bug me, no foolin'. Similarly, penultimate hymn \"Shine On\" is too Pure Prairie League for taste. But throughout the rest of North Pole, Quinn's songwriting is unpretentiously immaculate, rivaling ageless ing√©nue Jonathan Richman in the ability to confect nearperfect pop from deceptively facileseeming bubblegum base and sporkfuls of sugar. On \"I'll Lay You Down\", laden with woodsy CSNY harmonies, the refrain \"I'll lay you down before you fall\" may just be a (more?) poetic way to say \"I'll never let your head hit the bed/ Without my hand behind it\". But I'm ready to tell Quinn I'm free Friday night and open to going pillowshopping. \"Everybody Knows It Hurts\" has the graceful maturity of Lou Barlow's Emoh, \"Without You\" has killer Byrdsian riffs and crushingly childlike adoration, and \"What Am I Supposed to Do\" converses like reallife flirting partners given the benefit of dizzying pop hooksmithing. On \"Happy\", Quinn exclaims (happily): \"When the sun comes up it makes me happy/ When the sun goes down it makes me blue/ But when the stars shine bright and light up the night/ ...You know that makes me happy too.\" Straightlined. More elegant than it looks. "}
