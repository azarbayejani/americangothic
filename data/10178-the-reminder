{"label":" Interscope / Cherrytree","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/9991/homepage_large.ca7409c0.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ryan Dombal","artist":"Feist","title":"The Reminder","text":" On \"Mushaboom\", the signature track from her 2004 breakthrough album Let It Die, Leslie Feist claimed, \"It may be years until the day my dreams will match up with my pay.\" Now, after countless soldout shows across the world, close to half of a million records sold, and placement in a commercial for British bed manufacturers Silentnight, it seems safe to say this NPR darling's \"pay\" should be satisfactory. But, while Feist may now be able to afford the idyllic hideaway she pined for in \"Mushaboom\", the Calgary native still wouldn't be able to enjoy its creature comforts thanks to her hectic, frequentflyer schedule. Alas: Faraway, so close. Brimming with heartbreak, solitude, and foggy memories, Feist's \"dreams\" still sound distant on The Reminder, the singer's outstanding third album. Mostly written on the road, the new LP gets its inspiration from the disconnections of nonstop, intercontinental hoteljumping. Talking about her ephemeral lifestyle in an interview with Pitchfork last year, Feist said, \"You just never set roots; you take pleasure in simple conversations, because you know you're not going to have much more than that.\" Though she's trekked on her own and with bands including By Divine Right and Broken Social Scene for more than a decade, the 31yearold songwriter sounds desperate for something more than \"simple conversation\" here. Unlike the halfcovers/halforiginal split of Let It Die, every song but one was at least cowritten by Feist on The Reminder. (And her buzzing take on the traditional playground singalong \"Sea Lion Woman\" makes it distinctively Feistian anyway.) Whereas her last album's smoothedout eclecticism could be both daunting and empty, The Reminder is equally diverse yet more fullblooded. From the indie pop of \"I Feel It All\" to the creeping electroballad \"Honey Honey\", the album ambles effortlessly; its musical palette is wide enough to stave off repetition yet innate enough to offer an intense cohesiveness. The record's keen combination of offthecuff production and nofat songwriting is likely linked to its method: With several songs whittled down over years of performances, Feist aided by her usual onenamed conspirators Gonzales and Mocky, along with Jamie Lidell and others recorded them in less than a week in a manor outside Paris. Fleeting touches from horns, glockenspiels, makeshift choirs, and other subtle accoutrements never announce themselves ostentatiously. Instead, the LP relies on a modest refinement that breaks with current singersongwriter trends that promote infinite ambition in lieu of the basics melody, arrangement, feeling.  Hardly the first singersongwriter to love, live, lose, and emote, Feist once again elevates herself above countless other diarykeeping tunesmiths with a voice that could make even Dick Cheney weep. Marked by specks of Dusty Springfield's soul, Bj√∂rk's confrontational adventurousness, and Joni Mitchell's warmth, the singular allure of Feist's vocals is difficult to deny or overstate. You might hear her over cappuccinomachine hisses in Starbucks, but her directline moans easily cut through the biscotti muzak. And on The Reminder, her whispertowail control exemplified by stark hearttuggers \"The Water\" and \"Intuition\" is even more striking than before.  \"With sadness so real that it populates the city and leaves you homeless again,\" coos Feist on \"The Park\", a desolate, lovelorn lament. The song with its references to a relationship torn by distance, omnipotent nature (a carefree bird can be heard mocking Feist's sadness in the background), and a hazy \"past\" that offers partlyforgotten flickers and flashes is a fitting summary of The Reminder's wounded pleas. Leery of a sixth sense, the songstress concludes \"Intuition\" with a question, \"Did I miss out on you?\" its insolubility packing more ache than a hundred clearcut breakup songs. Such eternally spotty \"what if?\" queries needn't always strike such dour chords. On the shaggy, Broken Social Sceneesque romp \"Past to Present\", the refrain (\"There's so much past inside my present\") has the singer embracing yesteryear with a proud vitality. But no matter where she sits on love's teetertotter down on the afterthefact apology of \"I'm Sorry\" or aloft in heady infatuation on \"Brandy Alexander\" her philosophyofself is sound.  After inconclusively rifling though her personal history for 12 songs, Feist finally seems to reach an Emersonian transcendence on finale \"How My Heart Behaves\": \"I'm a stem now...fanning my yellow eye,\" she sings over wafting piano and harp. Though the song reads like a zen tutorial to her own unsettled emotions, it still finishes with a query: \"What grew and inside who?\" What she's referring to isn't exactly clear and that's the point. Pasts pass. People stay, go. But finding sanctuary within halfrealized dreams and faces? Timeless.  "}
