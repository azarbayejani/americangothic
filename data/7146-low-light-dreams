This album is gorgeous to space out to, and though it lacks the intricacy of Chessie's similarly inclined Plug Research release Overnight, its gauzy drones and rudimentary rhythm tracks do manage to effectively mimic lucid dreaming, underwater sunlight, and the atomic ballet of Brownian motion. After you're washed with threeminutes of cottonwool white noise entitled \"Light Fails Me\", Smith begins the guided tour of his crepuscular world. With soothing waves of distortion and a bass drum simulating a heartbeat, \"Building Memories Without You\" borrows heavily from Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project. Smith also pays homage to Bj√∂rk with \"Grosse Strasse\", which is how I would imagine the opening strings of her sublime \"Unravel\" might sound if remixed by Main and Force Inc's Geoff White. The delicately wavering drones and functional percussion of \"Detached Under Buildings\" turn bewitching when Smith plugs in his guitar. He repeats a simple threechord phrase, beneath which he almost imperceptibly alters his drum machine's timbres. Elsewhere, \"Interior Dub\" is pure firstgeneration postrock dub: occasional rimshots pepper a glistening synthline while Smith's bass slopes low to the ocean floor. Then, emerging from this hypnogogic zone, Smith sings indistinguishable words which recall the textural station platform announcements of Aphex Twin's \"Tha\". Though the title parodies a Spacemen 3 album, \"Dreaming About Making Music to Dream To\" is deceptively the clubbiest cut on the album. Yet, for all its syncopated percussion, the immense washes of blissful white noise (and the eerie countermelody) may force even the most crankedup nonstopraver to join the wallflowers. \"Night Is Blurred\" goes for a similar deception, but this time Smith keeps the white noise more surreptitious in the mix and gives greater prominence to micropercussion and a downcast, indigent melody. This track could be a \"Voodoo Ray\" or \"Pacific State\" for depressives.Low Light Dreams closes with \"Post Obsession\", Smith's first real display of uniqueness. Subverting the derivative subterranean drift of the rest of the album, Smith allows dissonant chording and mechanical clanks to disrupt his serene drones. Though these sounds remind me of Seefeeler Mark Clifford's Disjecta project, Smith unburdens himself of overt influence here, and, I sincerely hope, points to territories he'll explore on future outings.
