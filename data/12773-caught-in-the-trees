One has to wonder, however, if there weren't a few seasoned fans in that audience whose \"awwww\"s were underscored by \"uhoh\"s. The songwriter settling down here is, after all, one of the better chroniclers of heartbreak, betrayal, and the other side of love working at the moment. And while no decent person could wish misery on another just for the sake of song, we've nevertheless seen plenty of talents derailed by rehab, children, and holy matrimony. But let's not get carried away: What we do know is something maybe marriage, maybe a general restlessness, maybe straightup serendipity woke Jurado up after 2006's stately and sometimes sleepy  Now That I'm in Your Shadow. The result, 2008 opus  Caught in the Trees, features a rock solid outing from backing bandmates Jenna Conrad and Eric Fisher supporting some of Jurado's best songwriting to date not to mention his most rousing musical offerings since  I Break Chairs, all congealing in a manner one can't help but call effortless. Opener \"Gillian Was a Horse\" sets the bar high, thanks to crisp drumming and the clockwork crunch of a maraca. \"Trials\" and \"Caskets\" are similarly propulsive, carried along by confident strums and a viscous bassline, respectively. Elsewhere, \"Last Rights\" sails along a bed of strings. Gone are the pregnant silences that punctuated  Shadow, and with them the hesitant tempos of hopelessness.  Caught in the Trees, quite simply, is too busy moving along to get too caught up in anything. Which isn't to say Jurado's usual complexities aren't here; if he has ever written an unequivocally contented song, I've yet to hear it. Indeed, a good half of the numbers on  Caught in the Trees  deal directly with a favorite theme of Jurado's: the fallout from infidelity, manifest most often here in repeated references to lies, liars, lying, specters of jealous husbands, and \"bullshit talkers.\" Yet there's a sense of progress too, of looming reconciliation or at the very least the intention to work things through rather than dwell on them. \"Dimes\" begins with Jurado resolving to call a lover's husband, and ends by asking \"What happens now, when it all goes down?\" Later, \"Sheets\" seems to take that husband's perspective, with the lover cast as \"a wounded bird needing a nest.\" By \"Best Dress\", someone could be the lover, could be the husband sounds prepared the claim the embattled woman as his own once and for all. Still, the most satisfying moments on  Trees  are those that find Jurado and his band embracing their pop sensibilities: \"Gillian\" is a thing of wondrous songwriting efficacy, its verses all snapping snugly into place like so many Lego blocks. Album high point \"Go First\" triumphs as both the record's most dynamic and anthemic track, and like \"Gillian\", also makes the most concessions to standard versechorus structure.  Trees' latter half culminates with \"Paper Kite\", which conveys a drama and a desolation that go beyond Jurado's words thanks to atmospheric production flourishes. These three tracks in particular feel the most removed from  Shadow, and, we might speculate, the most indicative of what our groom may have in store posthoneymoon. If that is so, then by all means: till death do them part. "}
