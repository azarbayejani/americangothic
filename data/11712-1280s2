The verdict: too slow and would be improved by cartoon amphibian ragga chat. So it goes with the rest of 12\"/80s/2. Critic and personal hero John Leland has said the 12\" single was the artform (not just the format) of the 1980s, and he's not wrong. On other days I might just make it \"single,\" since 12\" leaves out such totemic 80s artifacts as the first Minor Threat record and Wayne Smith's \"Under Mi Sleng Teng\". But singles are almost always the artform of any decade, and limiting it to 12\"'s for a certain decade makes it nicely polemical. It was probably just a coincidence of commerce, but when CBS (then the biggest major) axed the vinyl single at the dawn of the 90s, it was the end of an era. 12\" singles survive, obviously, but niche marketed to their individual dance scenes. Mixtape tracks, mp3s, whatever...all have features intrinsic to the format that quietly nudge the music into its given shape. When the 12\" single disappeared, so did extended disco motion and mod FX abuse from the pop single still recognizable as a pop single. As the 90s dawned, with house first flexing its iron grip, it became much easier to bung an acapella on top of 4/4 boomtick to make sure it got Club Play. This is probably the last time \"dance music\" meant multiplicity without being consciously eclectic. Unfortunately, we run into the same problem as the last time I was reviewing one of these things. Scribble out the title above and replace it with \"If You Were White and British In the 80s, It Might Have Sounded Like This.\" I count the number of nonpalefaces at around three. And, of course, since this is a British collection, no Americans, no rappers, ragga toasters, gogo troupes, Latin freestylers, funk mobs, or unwashed psychobillies. I am not saying it's gotta have the 12\" mixes of \"I Feel For You\" or \"Raspberry Beret\" or the \"Rock Box\" single to be \"complete.\" But, from the tracklisting to the octagonal syndrums on the cover, there's an icky kitsch vibe that hampers my enjoyment. Which is a shame because, musically, at least on the first disc, it's pretty unimpeachable, way better than the first. Can you fuck with the Bowiewithhisnutsinavice dramedy of the Associates' \"Party Fears Two\"? The Tarzan boy roiling dementia of Pigbag's \"Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag\"? The \"Annihilation mix\" of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's \"Two Tribes\", which makes cold war paranoia and mutually assured destruction seem both terrifying and thrilling, as well as including the wackest Reagan impersonation this side of Rich Little? The protofreestyle of the \"Miami mix\" of ABC's \"When Smokey Sings\"? The Patrick Nagel glitch of Duran Duran's \"The Reflex\"? The bestAfricandiscoripoffever of Tom Tom Club's \"Genius of Love\"? The Cole Portermeetsconga line acid wit of Kid Creole's \"Annie I'm Not Your Daddy\"? (Who, along with Sly & Robbie, are among the few nonanglos here. Oh, and 1/3 of the Thompson Twins.) The amyl nitrate and camp moustache Kraftwerk pastiche of Yello's \"The Race\"? No, of course you cannot. As Tom Ewing noted on NYLPM, compilations like this one cast a weird sort of spell in a record store. You hold it in your hands, admire the packaging, notice all the great songs you love and the ones you don't know that could be great, breath in the total consumer object pheromone. And then suddenly all the bad (or mediocre) songs disappear. Until you get it home and play the damn thing. (Generally I have no problem with Culture Club, but \"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\" is so sickly coy and mimsy that you start to think Albini has a point.) These type of comps are also becoming more untenable as (remember kids) legal downloading outpaces traditional bricks and mortar outlets. That sure is nice packaging though. "}
