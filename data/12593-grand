{"label":" Fader","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13104/homepage_large.3b403e93.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Rebecca Raber","artist":"Matt & Kim","title":"Grand","text":" Maturity is a good look for some bands, but Matt & Kim, at first glance, don't seem the type. Over the past four years, the Brooklynbased duo made its name from a joyously amateurish EP, a cheerily sloppy debut fulllength, and an energetic live show that left a string of sweaty, satisfied audiences in its wake. Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino took Mates of State's spare, coed, drum'n'keys setup and bled it of anything mannered or pretty, leaving just raw, bleeting synthesizers, shouty singing, and relentless drumming. So the last thing we'd expect from this spazzy synthpunk band is a slowed down, gussiedup sophomore effort, but Matt & Kim wear their newfound growth surprisingly well.Their previous recorded material was more like their propulsive stage show, so the first thing you'll notice about Grand is the band explores new textures and diverse dynamics. More than half of the 11song album lives in the mid downtempo range, making Grand feel more wistful and intimate than its predecessors likely the result of recording in Johnson's childhood bedroom in Vermont. \"Don't Slow Down\", despite its title and \"Just Can't Get Enough\"like staccato melody, proves an insistent kick drum and repeated keyboard stabs can sound reflective and poignant. \"Spare Change\" buoys its droning, buried organ with handclaps and foot stomps but still manages to sound vulnerable and lonely amid the raucous percussion. And \"Turn This Boat Around\", a drumfree ballad built on a charming calliopelike keyboard melody, is almost reverent in its relative stillness. Such changes are welcome a good band needs to evolve to continue to stay interesting but Matt & Kim are still at their best when they are at their fastest. \"I Wanna\" takes a cue from earlier tracks \"5K\" and \"Yea Yeah\", but even that track measures its breakneck pace with a slow section, settling its demanding verses into a more deliberate, looser groove. Instrumental \"Cinders\" features a melody so happily jerky and rhythms so dangerously spastic that you can practically hear paroxysmal crowds pogoing madly. With glossy (by Matt & Kim's DIY standards) production doubletracked vocals, synthesizer effects (check that violinlike sound on \"Good Ol' Fashion Nightmare\"), and more clarity of sound a newfound emphasis is placed on Matt & Kim's words. Luckily, Grand features not only some of the band's most personal lyrics, but also some of its most universal. Though made in a more pastoral setting than these outerborough denizens are used to, the album's subject matter is still decidedly urban. \"Don't Slow Down\", one of two tracks that namechecks the LP's titular Brooklyn street, is like a hipster \"We Didn't Start The Fire\", listing all of the tiny details of life in the creative underclass. \"Lock knees, no keys/ Brooklyn, Grand Street/ Four flights, late nights/ Black socks, white tights\", sings Johnson, and thousands of other kids in his zip code (and others like it around the country) feel like he's describing their Saturday nights even if this album is less of a party than their previous recordings.
