Three decades ago, as a member of Marine Girls and on her debut solo album, Thorn nailed a strain of wispy, ramshackle, beachthemed guitarpop that was halfway between Young Marble Giants and the Raincoats, predicting the likes of Cub, the Softies, and even Best Coast. With her husband Ben Watt in Everything But the Girl (and as a guest vocalist on Massive Attack's stillstunning \"Protection\"), she applied that minimalism to a jazzier, more sophisticated, and more electronicsfriendly approach, coming up alongside Sade in a lineage that has most recently given us the xx, Jessie Ware, and Sky Ferreira (on \"Everything Is Embarrassing\", at least). Thorn's last solo LP, 2010's Love and Its Opposite, was a richly melancholic album that should please fans of recent releases by Jens Lekman or Jonathan Richman. Thorn has a unique, smoky voice, expressive and poised and cozily English all at once a fine mix of attributes for any caroler. Still, with the exception of a frankly gorgeous stringsandpiano rendition of 1944's \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" that should be an instant addition to your yuletide playlists, Thorn mostly goes for nontraditional fare on Tinsel and Lights. Her arrangements are neatly varied, from homey brass parts to frosty electropop; her song selections are impressively eclectic, ranging from country divas and 70s singersongwriters to more recent indie icons; and Love and Its Opposite collaborator Ewan Pearson's colorfully muted production is virtually faultless. But a Christmas record is different from other albums though you might only play it a few weeks each year, you want to play it all the way through, maybe multiple times in quick succession and the moments of goodness and light here bump up against plenty of songs that are depressing or otherwise unseasonalfeeling. You're happy to get the present, but it's not exactly what you would've asked for from Santa. After the quaintly vernacular \"Merry Little Christmas\", Thorn's most rewarding Tinsel and Lights tracks are also the most lighthearted, such as her crisp, slinky reworking of the White Stripes' \"In the Cold, Cold Night\" that wonderfully transforms the Elephant original into a sort of electro\"Fever\" for the \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" season. Pianobased \"Joy\" (\"That's why, that's why/ The carols make you cry\") and the waltzing, vaguely \"Fairytale of New York\"like title track are the lone originals, and they set the conflicted but honestly sentimental, adultromantic tone. Elsewhere, Thorn's urbane take on Dolly Parton's downtrodden but sassy \"Hard Candy Christmas\" somewhat calls to mind the Sundays' \"Here's Where the Story Ends\", and her harrowed \"Sister Winter\" revamps one of Sufjan Stevens' best \"Christmas\" songs. If Thorn's take on the traditional tune and her White Stripes cover demand a place in the overcrowded holiday canon, the several sleepier and more downcast songs here don't quite. Scritti Politti's Green Gartside, with his syrupy coo, is a welcome holiday visitor on an electronic cover of Low's \"Taking Down the Tree\", but the song selection only underlines how special that slowcore band's beautifully bleak Christmas album really was. Tinsel and Lights' Stephin Merrittwritten \"Like a Snowman\" is exquisitely sung and put together, but lacks the Magnetic Fields mastermind's usual clever bite; Thorn's Ron Sexsmith cover, \"Maybe This Christmas\", unfortunately verges on the drippiness of the schmaltzy \"GrownUp Christmas List\". With Everything But the Girl, Thorn and Watt (who plays guitar on a couple of tracks here) already recorded the ideal sort of Christmas song for their understated yet unashamedly tender approach. From 1994's Amplified Heart, \"25th December\" is a reverby, detailstrewn reflection on Christmases past. The old man plays the piano, the aunties and uncles are there, and then suddenly the kid's an adult, there are tears, and somehow it's too late for... something. \"No, I never ever realized,\" Watt sings, with Thorn in poignant harmony. A new version of this song will appear on the vinyl edition of Tinsel and Lights. One more reason it might be a joy to unwrap under the tree, after all. "}
