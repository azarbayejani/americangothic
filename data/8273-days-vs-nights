{"label":" Turnstile","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/8136/homepage_large.fba11c91.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Sam Ubl","artist":"Trouble Everyday","title":"Days vs. Nights","text":" It isn't clear which \"Camden\" Trouble Everyday are referring to in the title of the opening cut on their debut album, Days vs. Nights. The postpunk parvenus find the majority of their musical roots across the Atlantic aping all of the usual postpunk suspects with their peppy breed of pellucid, chorusdriven rock but Trouble Everyday hail from Philadelphia, just over the river from Camden, N.J. Either way, Trouble Everyday waste no time laying their strengths out on the table. The track nicely sets the tone for this taut collection as crunchy but limpid guitars steer the song toward a classic twoword chorus: \"Red light\", brays vocalist Kyle Costill repeatedly over a set of tensionrelieving changeups. The song like Days vs. Nights as a whole is constructed with familiar materials: urgent eighthnote guitar attacks, syncopated vocal yelps, and jumpy melodic bass lines. But these seemingly runofthemill source elements are deftly handled and transformed into something potent by nearperfect mixing and the band's earnestness. Trouble Everyday are all about distillation: At under a halfhour, Days vs. Nights economically maneuvers through 11 songs, each complete with airtight structure and an endlessly hummable refrain. Although derivative to the point of being almost obtrusive, these songs are uniformly catchy and ain't that the bottom line? Days vs. Nights hits all the major touchstones, cavorting from infectious twominute buzz of \"Kids (Make a Living)\" to the dirgeful, Joy Divisionstyle postpunk of \"Code Word\" to the scuzzedup sensitive guy new wave of \"(Close Enough to Call it) Even\". But Trouble Everyday's influences extend beyond the usual anglophilic tributes to include a number of American bands. \"Written in Snakes\" with its shoutsung lyrics and jammy, opensounding recording quality is reminiscent of Lonesome Crowded Westera Modest Mouse. And songs like the aforementioned \"Code Word\" owe not only their stylistic founding fathers, but also latterday torchbearers such as The Rapture and Interpol. As strange as it may sound, without those modern heirs a band like Trouble Everyday might not be enjoying the attention they're getting. For postpunk revivalists even those as adroit as Trouble Everyday it's best of times, worst of times: The cause cÂŽl\\x8Fbre of bands like The Strokes and Franz Ferdinand means increased exposure for but also an inevitable (and, in this case, unjust) backlash against other purveyors of the form. Trouble Everyday even offer what could be construed as acknowledgment of this problem when on \"Camden\", Costill sings, \"Hey you, what you think about the new fad?\" Unfortunately, Costill's ironic salvo will likely do little to stop the kneejerk reactions against his band.
