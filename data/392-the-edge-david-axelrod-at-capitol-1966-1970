Sometimes it's easy to mistake Axelrod's showy productions for bombastic and soulless affairs, much like Maravich's illregarded and ostentatious ballhandling. But also like Maravich, Axelrod used flash as a means to substance, not a substitute for it. His Capitol years, where he threaded the deep breakbeats of power drumming (typically courtesy the unshakeable Earl Palmer) with ornate orchestration, are akin to Pistol Pete's ridiculously unheralded fouryear term at Louisiana State University. They scored at will and dazzled in the process.The Edge is an expertly selected compendium of Axelrod at his zenith, including obvious orchestral monsters like Lou Rawls' \"You've Made Me So Very Happy\" strapped next to lesserheard gems like Letta Mbulu's literally stormy \"Pula Yetia\". The majority of the 17 tracks come from Axelrod's solo albums, particularly his first two William Blakeinspired works, Song of Innocence and Songs of Experience, essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hiphop. These albums have literally been a rap producer's delight for years. \"The Human Abstract\"'s morosely iridescent piano line was famously sampled by DJ Shadow on \"Midnight in a Perfect World\". Pete Rock cribbed from \"Smile\" for \"Strange Fruit\". Lord Finesse dipped in, too. Black Moon got to \"A Divine Image\" as well. How \"Holy Thursday\", the source for UNKLE's \"Rabbit in Your Headlights\" among more than 10 other songs each more obscure than the next, missed the cut is inscrutable. This wealth of sampleworthy material draws Axelrod's brilliance to light even further. Each element of his productions stood out, whether an obvious trumpet solo or the lowestofthelow key xylophone note. Axelrod was unafraid to walk near the lines of pretentiousness, too. Some songs, like \"The Signs, Part One\", from his hugtheglobecuzyouloveit exploration Earth Rot, used haughty choral arrangements while others used the evertrite spokenword. Still, he makes each one work. Like the Pistol, Axelrod has been ripped off, in homage or not. John Stockton, another thin, white Utah Jazz guard got his game smarts and razorsharp elbows from Maravich. Just as in the respectful and wizardly hands of Axelrod enthusiast Shadow, Axelrod's grace and power shines through. In a freeshooting whirling dervish like Allen Iverson, an obvious Maravich disciple, we see blazing talent but no brakes for the motor. Akin maybe to Dr. Dre, an Axelrod admirer who's been known to crank the bluster up a tad too much in the past.The Edge closes on Cannonball Adderley's extended and tightlylaced \"Tensity\" a bold, buzzing 12minute trip. The only artist to flip a sample from \"Tensity\" was rap duo the Beatnuts for a skit from their 1993 Intoxicated Demons EP. On the skit, called \"Engineer Talking Shit\", a man in a booth, over the crashing snares of \"Tensity\", says \"They got no kind of beat, they never understand the shit, no soul.\" This will never be said about Axelrod.
