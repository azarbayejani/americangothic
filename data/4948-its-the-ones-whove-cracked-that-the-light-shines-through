{"label":" Rough Trade","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/4886/homepage_large.12a53936.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andy Beta","artist":"Jeffrey Lewis & the Jitters","title":"It's the Ones Who've Cracked That the Light Shines Through","text":" As any critic will tell you, the hardest review to write is one that you don't really care about. So when confronted with the latest of the antifolk bumper crop, postMoldy Peaches, by the lackluster Jeffrey Lewis, I found myself with very little to say, and many blank pages for discussing an album sold to me with the snake oil descriptor that it was \"[Roky] Erickson himself chainsawing apart Lou Reed's Transformer\". (Looks like I'll never trust Uncutagain.) For that simple reason, I decided to revert to Lewis' other artistic medium, that of a comic book artist, and critique his album in a form he might be more comfortable with with certain songs from his second album on Rough Trade given an impressionistic rendering. Many thanks to Cole Johnson of Sleepover Comics for providing the ink. "}
