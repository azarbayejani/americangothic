{"label":" 679","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/9372/homepage_large.28dc003d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By William Bowers","artist":"Plan B","title":"Who Needs Actions When You Got Words","text":"  This album's first 10 seconds: a cavernous wind, an elliptical backwards sample, and 22yearold East Londoner Ben Drew announcing that it's his \"time,\" calling those of us on the receiving end of his lecture \"fucking cunts\" who'd \"best listen up.\" Expecting his audience to tolerate such abuse requires a wildly selfserving imagination; this rapper is like Shakespeare's Richard III giddily wooing the widow of a guy he just killed. Opening track \"Kidz\" definitely wants to have it both ways (á la Larry Clark's cautionary/titillating film of virtually the similar name), indulging in myriad violent/sexual fantasies, but chorusfiling the firstperson rant away as a (cliché) moral editorial about \"kids today.\" Five minutes worth of freshman Freud helps to synopsize all of side A, during which castration fear abounds. Each track oversalutes the speaker's dick, a phallus whose power is constantly under threat from eager vaginas rife with disease. The repeated images of throatslitting obviously refer to a need to figuratively emasculate rivals (see the hiphop tradition of penisediting terror that dawns with Grandmaster Flash's \"trying not to lose my head,\" running through \"King Kut\", the 1990s fixation with \"peeling caps back,\" and even \"Where's Your Head At\"). Taboos such as anality and necrophilia are alternately seductive and horrifying, as the speaker waffles between primal and civilized urges. Resentment of an inability to monopolize the female parent's sexual attention surfaces on \"Mama (Loves a Crackhead)\". The forbidden youthful desire for the sister is fulfilled on \"Charmaine\", about a 14yearold who can be humped because her \"enormous\" breasts constitute \"real woman\"hood (after an intimidating encounter with the \"shiny head\" of an oversized \"doorman\"). The first seven of these 14 songs peaks with the blindingly Oedipal \"I Don't Hate You\", a massive takedown of a father illfated by his intimacy with the gods. The second half wakes up from a dreamstate to analyze it; the speaker wonders aloud at his subconscious reasons for his behavior. The music previously reliant on two guitar chords (either played mournfully or Doobie Brosfully) over huge drum loops recedes into the trappings of sophistication: \"Everyday\" owes its titanicness to the lack of an anchoring beat, electing to subsist on a chamberpop requiem. I'm tempted to think that B has heard the transcendent and beautiful drumless bootlegs of Terror Squad over Modest Mouse and the Streets over Red Hot Chili Peppers (by DJs Erb and Simon Chapman, respectively). The track reveals that, somehow, the syncopated bottomend of most rap anthems serves to mellow the urgent lyrics rather than intensify them. Diddy even begins his new album over a Tears For Fears sample that never \"kicks in\"; what I'm trying to say is that hiphop can go \"ambient\" without succumbing to (let's not name names) avantgarde paroxysms.  The redundant thuggishnesss of side one (talking tough shit about being sick of people talking tough shit?) gives way to the staccato piano of side two's brilliant debunking of gangsta poseurs, \"Where Ya From\". The early addictionrants and stonerreveries yield to the condemnation of drug use that is \"Missing Links\". Fans of unbowed hardness will probably be made ill by \"Couldn't Get Along\"'s trucey softrock percussion, tearverge vocals, and PhillipGlassmeets\"The Young and the Restless\" musicianship.  Plan B manages to milk his biographical plight without resorting to the childhoodtraumaaspissingcontest tactics of most memoirists, even if he does exceedingly privilege death as a harbinger of realism. (In fact, some of his efforts reveal melodramaturgy similar to the convenient resolutions of \"issuesbased\" cinema such as Traffic and Crash.) The darkness can be a little much, because he's never flatout ridiculous like, say, Fear smirksinging about nun assault, but B's cauldron of bits from the Bible, Nas, and Prodigy gets lightened a tad by shoutouts to Coolio and Hall & Oates.  Still: dude's named himself after an emergency contraceptive what do you want? He's too busy pointing out how elements of mainstream (Michael Jackson, TV news) and high (Irreversible, City of God) culture are as bilious as their low or underground counterparts to even bother caring about his own supposed genre; the electrocrash of Hadouken's (nonalbum ) remix of \"No More Eatin\" is more grime than anything on Who Needs Actions When You Got Words, which pretty much sounds like a UK Sage Francis produced by Everlast. (The BBC calls his music \"urban.\" So, what, Jarvis Cocker is \"rural\"?) And to be fair, the album's sensitive wrapup contains consecutive songs about rendering folks toothless; Freudians claim that the loss of choppers symbolizes impotence. Regardless, \"I Don't Hate You\" bears some of this year's sharpest fangs.  "}
