Bigbudget boy bangs and popped collars aside, the Surrey fivepiece aren't another \"guitars are cool again\" heroworship exercise like Razorlight or the Vines. Nor do they bank on pseudointellectual histrionics like Panic! at the Disco. With a less stiflingly stodgy approach to pop than the garage rock revivalists and a better memory for mallpunk's catchiness than those emo brats, WinterKids write hooks, not haircuts. Not only haircuts, anyway. WinterKids' fulllength debut, Memoirs, recalls teenage heartbreak with good cheer and a measure of wit. It never betters the easy pop gestalt of breakout single \"Tape It\", which gets at awkward adolescent butterflies without overreaching or selfcongratulation. There's just one verse repeated twice, a yearning bridge, and plenty of stupidly great choruses, organized around Bradley Osborne's exclamatory guitar fills and singer James Snider's youthful enthusiasm. I'm still not entirely sure what this song is about videotaping your favorite show because the girl you used to watch it with just sent you a \"Dear John\" text, presumably but its basicasbeingdumped melody feels beyond reproach. If \"Tape It\" sets the WinterKids template, the rest of Memoirs generally does its damnedest to match up. Songs like \"Hear Me Out\", \"All the Money\", and \"Use Your Feet\" put more big choruses (and the occasional handclaps) to another set of succinct guitar lines, Bloc Partying bass grooves, analog synths, Pipetteslike female backing vocals, and a whole lotta unrequited longing. Yet for all their energy, these tracks' predictable songwriting keeps them from equaling the sum of their parts. \"Didn't take too long/ to write another song,\" Snider admits on \"Adore\".  Other tracks betray the outsize ambitions \"Tape It\" goofily realizes. But merely sounding ambitious doesn't sound nearly as good. For proof, there's drippy ballad \"Somebody Else's Clothes\", where banjos, fake strings, and a cappella harmonies don't help answer Snider's questions about \"knowing what's right.\" Swollen piano waltz \"Playing Cards With Gingerbread\" takes a similar misstep, capping the album with a pompous reflection on touring life that builds into Neon Biblereading sound and fury. Memoirs works best when producer Fraser Smith (who turned lesser compositions to gold for the likes of Rachel Stevens and Jamelia) can set aside his philosopher's stone and just, well, tape it.  "}
