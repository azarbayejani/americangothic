{"label":" Asthmatic Kitty","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/14138/homepage_large.c7dbaa3d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andrew Gaerig","artist":"Royal City","title":"Royal City","text":" Funerals are for the living, not for the dead, but the years covered by Royal City's farewell odds and sods compilation, 1999–2004, reminds us of the stressful, joyful, creative lives of many young bands. That time period spans an inexact period of my life likely yours as well but holds plenty of importance for the members of the Guelph, Ontario, countryrockers Royal City. It covers the lifetime of a band that, along with the Constantines, helped spark an uptick in early 2000s Canadian indie in Guelph and Toronto.Royal City have the profile of a pressurized, scenemaking band of ruffians: fervent collaborators, singer Aaron Riches was a prominent figure in Guelph's punk scene, while Jim Guthrie was an already established singer/guitarist. But the band's records, including 2001 pinnacle Alone at the Microphone, showcase a band whose finest quality was restraint. Royal City songs shuffle along, augmented by slight country signifiers, by Guthrie's exacting guitar curls and Riches' modest poetry. So the cover of Iggy Pop's tongueincheek \"Here Comes Success\" that begins Royal City as well as the animal howls of \"In the Autumn\", the harderedged version of Alone opener \"Bad Luck\" represent a figurative letting down of hair for young men who'd always acted beyond their age.A handful of tracks here suggest Royal City had more to give: \"Postcards\" is a slyly clanging, imagistic epic, the type of statement song their albums often lacked. \"O You With Your Skirt\" is flirty and engaged, its reserved lust the perfect soundtrack to your next afternoon spent sundressgazing. \"A Belly Was Made for Wine\" recalls Uncle Tupelo in its tight melodic phrasing; \"Dog Song\" is sweet and literal (\"He's a very very very nice dog/Even though he barks\").Royal City doesn't imply progression, though: its tracks are not sequenced chronologically (in fact, it's not close: the compilation is bookended by the only two tracks recorded in 2001, for example), and the highlights listed above are scattered through the band's six years. So the proceeding is not one of mourning what might've been but simply pleasant recollection. If you're a fan, it will allow you to mostly forgive the undercooked acoustic demos (\"Can't You Hear Me Calling\", \"I Called But You Were Sleeping\") or retreads (an early version of \"Bad Luck\" offers little insight and no improvement) and revel in details like the kazoo solo during \"Here Comes Success\" (ushered in: \"Here comes kazooooo!\"), the selfreferential chorus of \"In the Autumn\" (\"CITY/ Royal city\"), and the band's sleepytime cover of the Strokes' \"Is This It\".For a band of Royal City's profile, as scenemakers, as brief collaborators with artists like Feist and Owen Pallett (Final Fantasy), as a young band that started local (on Guelphbased Three Gut Records) and found believers (their final two albums landed on Rough Trade, and Royal City arrives in gorgeous, bound packaging from Asthmatic Kitty), this set lacks a little bit of fire. But it remains pretty true to Royal City's reputation as talented, smart artists who, probably deservedly, remained on the periphery of the Canadian indie rock explosion. "}
