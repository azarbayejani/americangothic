Head spinning like a locomotion, the only salient wisp of cognition I had at my disposal was the realization that for all intents and purposes my most timeconsuming \"hobby\" was neither music or sports as I had previously considered, but instead the act of waiting blindly in anticipation for the series of events that daily forced their way into my path. Of course, the national fervor with which our culture stands behind demarcated velvet ropes is not without intent or reward: the goal of all this condoned loitering is obviously the inevitable attainment of some worthwhile prize. Thus, the cycle fatefully continues: structured quiescence leading to hopefully unbridled enjoyment, be it the stagnant vegetation of waiting for the next bigthing's debut, or the lipbiting standstill of witnessed betrothal resulting in either drunken bliss at some tented reception or some hardearned wedding night play. Trends are not so easily contained by international borders, though: somehow, the American tenseandease style of life and specifically music has imbedded itself directly in the unlikely bosom of Oslo, Norway, deep within the ranks of the Norwegian musical collective Jaga Jazzist, in their latest fulllength The Stix. Fronted by the brothers Horntveth, multiinstrumentalist Lars and drumprogrammer Martin, the troupe offers an ebb and flow of tight musical compositions derived from such varied influences as free jazz, Squarepusherdrum 'n bass, and Duke Ellington's original big band. \"Kitty WÃº\" begins the album with a low, breathy sigh, as a heavy reed mimics a high register tune before evolving into a fully orchestrated and electronically manipulated pulse of breakdown and return. From this, a modal progression ascends through the wind and finally collapses into a treated vibraphone, as the skittering sound of drum 'n bass breaks play constantly in the background, only occasionally rising to the forefront of the track. Eventually, the lazy coda of the composition is picked up anew by the harderthroughcomparison \"Day\" and \"Another Day\" suite, the two songs accenting an informal beat, the host to the breezy synthdriven melody. Sounding like a mid80s Stereolab soundtrack to a black and white Audrey Hepburn film, the tracks highlight the album's peak with a generous tension supplied between instrumental give and take, enjoyable in the same manner as early Tortoise or the most recent Cinematic Orchestra fulllength. With the exception of a few minor flourishes of awe and surprise littered throughout the remainder of the album for example, the highend fuzz of the previous Animal Chin EP track \"Toxic Dart\", the nursery rhyme skitter of \"Doppelganger\", and the slow salsa beat of \"I Could Have Killed Him In The Sauna\" The Stix is unfortunately plagued by the merit of its own complexity and taut instrumentation. This blandness of production and composition often results in leaving the listener with compulsory feelings of neglect between the rare moments when the group actually loosens up enough for the music to sound pleasurable as opposed to forced. Allowing for the inclusion of what appears to be found sound recordings of a distant panting animal and some industrial clatter, \"Reminders\" prompts a promising introduction that initially seems to excuse the above rejoinder, but ultimately falls into a homogeneous and glossy pattern of dense muzak that is nearly as compelling as a trip to the local drygoods store. Following this outline of polish and glean is \"Suomi Finland\", a gushing mesh of instruments of both acoustic and electronic origin that regrettably succumbs to the group's prominent love of 60sera spy soundtracks and cheesy synthprograms. \"Aerial Bright Dark Round\" and \"The Stix\" make noble attempts at dredging the rather forgettable second half of the album from its musical muck the former yielding its structure to sinister atonal swarms, the latter staggering its melody with a series of sharp electronic pulses but, for the sake of the album, it is a case of too little too late. Perhaps it's my overall impatience, but The Stix could benefit from a lessening of the stick in favor of the carrot; an occasional jolt of humanity would endear Jaga Jazzist's songs to heart, rather than pushing us away with the pretensions of this particularly objective slab of instrumental music. Though there's more than enough undisputed talent in this group to produce a series of wonderful albums in the future balanced in terms of likeability and technical skill for the moment The Stix is the line in the sand I'll wait for Jaga Jazzist to cross.
