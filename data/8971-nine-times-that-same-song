And what's the other, 99% of all love songs make me want to slit my face? Swedish indie pop group Love Is All admit as much in their bandname and album title. It's not necessarily a joke, but they're in on it: All people not just songwriters, Hallmark cards, and bridgeandtunnel dudes in party shirts and goingout jeans struggle talking love. Most hack it up; others come too wry on the game, too whiny, or their cleverness can be disgusting. Love Is All make it work cos they know their snags shitty equipment, lovelyrical clich√©, inevitable Life Without Buildings and Yeah Yeah Yeahs comparisons and speed headlong into them regardless. There's a dire necessity to Nine Times That Same Song, and ultimately that's its charm. Like the other recordings on the New Yorkbased What's Your Rupture? label, the playing happens beneath a prophylactic lofi glaze. All sounds seem to hit the mic at once, and our ears forgive the occasional imprecisions for the overall fit. So that's the musical counterpart to the lyrical problem turning lofi from a hohum excuse to a gritty asset. But we respond to passion, not perfection, and like your ESGs and Delta 5s, this band makes do like a motherfucker. \"Things, they aren't going that well,\" confesses singer Josephine Olausson on \"Used Goods\", which comes early in Nine Times's faint lovecycle sequencing: fall out, get over, fall in again. The song has sympathy for the stalker, who follows around town the one about to break her heart, noting those worthless similarities we all think actually mean something (\"we like the same kind of cheese\"). The guitar melody hams, and the rhythm section's on some Looney TunesmeetsOrange Juice disco chasescene bit, and funny synths poke out towards the end somehow the song communicates the complex of madness, embarrassment, and \"everybody does it, right?\"ness of watching someone pull away. \"I don't mind used goods,\" she admits ashamedly. Most times, though, the lyrics hide deep in reverb; LIA's most affecting turns are musical, and often extremely minimal. \"Talk Talk Talk Talk\" combines Daft Punk's \"one more time!\" chorus mourning in monotone, Karen O's \"rich rich rich\" snarl, James Chance sax skronk, and vicious callandresponse figures in support of the song's only intelligible line: \"Please just leave me alone.\" But all that's just a setup for the band's pregnant midsong pause they come back in a beat earlier than we expect and the song's tense last note, one halfstep away from resolving. \"Ageing Has Never Been His Friend\" tones down the desperation and ups the dance with a bigger beat, bass octaves, and a happygolucky sax line to underscore the song's misplaced hopes that all things love will stay \"fresh and young\": \"I keep the one I love/ In the freezer.\" By \"Turn the Radio Off\", no more bang: The sax plays out of tune, guitarists pluck out the chords as if they've lost all patience, and Olausson delivers the frustrated refrain, \"Hey world, I've had enough!\" The rest of Nine Times happens on the upswing, starting with the utterly optimistic singalong \"Make Out Fall Out Make Up.\" A counterpart to \"Turn the Radio Off\" in a way, the song acknowledges How Things Are, but grants \"I think I'll stay all day in bed\" a positivity \"Radio\" previously denied. \"Busy Doing Nothing\" takes nervous pleasure in the outofsight, outofmind gettingoveryou process \"Five movie marathons! Nine times that same song!\" and another deceptive stop/start and smart key change make this song the most exciting one on the album. The pretty twospeed romance ballad \"Felt Tip\" flirts with obscurities (stuff about \"spray cans\" and \"finger tips\" and \"step right on the beat\"), but that's romance is it not? A conflation of metametaphors and the prowl, this song about graffiti never says, brilliantly, \"The writing's on the wall.\" And then we're back again, in the frenzy of the fresh and young, \"clapping hands up in the air,\" saying yeah, unraveling your reactions. The band could have ended Nine Times a bit solipsistic but deservedly so on the lonely whattodo of \"Turn the TV Off\", the album's ninth song harhar. Too easy. In an album that's so anxiously avoided these types of cliches, the powerpop ditty \"Trying Too Hard\" truly seals the kiss with an afterthought: \"I was trying way too hard.\" Haven't we all. "}
