{"label":" Asthmatic Kitty","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/12992/homepage_large.4e098eb3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Eric Harvey","artist":"Grampall Jookabox","title":"Ropechain","text":" Those of us born and raised in Indiana, not exactly a farm team for celebrity culture, like to promote those of our own who have made good for themselves: The most commonly cited, at least among my friends, are John Mellencamp (from Seymour), Dave Letterman (Indianapolis), Axl Rose (Lafayette), David Lee Roth and John Darnielle (Bloomington), and of course, Michael Jackson (Gary). David \"Moose\" Adamson, who's been playing around the Hoosier State in various guises for a few years, has turned his affinity for the fallen King of Pop into \"I Will Save Young Michael\", which he's placed at the center of Ropechain, his first album for Indianapolis indie Asthmatic Kitty. \"I know for a fact that you're from Indiana, and so am I. So that makes us brothers,\" he intones in the song's spokenword outro. Then, his appeal: \"You gotta come back, and dance again, like you used to. Okay? Okay. Good.\" Made all the more hopeful by its harmless dopiness as a geographicallyinformed ode to a troubled soul, \"Michael\" sounds like it was written by Sufjan Stevens' dumbjock older brother after he heard his sibling's \"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\" Adamson's plea marks the highpoint of Ropechain's humanity.The rest of the time, it's druggie sentimentality like that of \"You Will Love My Room\": \"I took mushrooms and then proposed to you.\" The name Grampall Jookabox itself suggests someone emotionally and creatively frozen as a 19year old after a Reddiwip huff, and though Adamson tries the David Thomas/Captain Beefheart unhinged soulshouter approach on \"Room\", the song registers as a charmless, macho God Ween Satan outtake. \"Black Girls\", which flits through nonsensical utterances like \"black girls build skyscrapers with their brains\" and \"Betty Davis…the black Bette Davis\", is doofy and exploitative, and \"The Girl Ain't Preggers\" exudes the empathy of a checkoutline tabloid headline. The tweaker folkpsych goof \"The One Thing\" affirms most clearly that Adamson doesn't have much to say: Like that one guy senior year who preferred Xanax and Beam cocktails, Adamson repeats the titular phrase without ever telling us what that thing exactly is, let alone why it's worth writing a song about. I imagine him falling asleep sitting up while singing the hook ad infinitum.Yet despite its many faults, Ropechain is a hard record to hate: \"Thing\" has a solid groove, and the ridiculous, pointless lyrics of \"Black Girls\" only draw attention away from the tight, chirpy backmasked loop spinning out over a bleak, funky industrial bed, which made me type \"Anticonye West\" in my notes. Good ideas lurk throughout the album, but they either disappear under the weight of too much echo and overdubbing, or get pushed aside as a result of what I'd imagine is either a lack of discipline or dissenting voice during the creative process. Appropriately, \"Let's Go Mad Together\" a kitschy, fun scifi choogle during which Adamson attempts scatsinging but achieves a boorish stutter sounds like the desperate product of being alone for too long, perhaps near a MacBook and GarageBand.Partially because Indiana recently turned blue for the first time in 44 years, I feel less fucked than ever at the moment. But Ropechain's brief bit of chirpy stoner paranoia \"We Know We Might Be Fucked\", and the backporchjam nihilism of \"I'm Absolutely Freaked Out\", dredge up more personal, and less pleasant memories for me. They're occasionally catchy, and certainly harmless enough, but they also make plain Adamson's intermittent attention span and dearth of insight, which makes me uneasy (and not in the fun way).  Ropechain isn't going to displace Margot & the Nuclear SoandSos as the standardbearers for Indieana any time soon (though please, someone hurry up and do it), but the album can stake a claim to represent that everunderrepresented subculture that the nineteenth state owns as well as the other 49: Fidgety suburban druggies.
