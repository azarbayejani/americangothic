For a group who made their entrance with the autobiographical origin story \"Formed a Band\", the pledge that \"it's not irony, it's not rock'n'roll,\" and a humble and brash sound meant more to buttress singer Eddie Argos' wry observations than draw attention, landmines for a \"mature\" followup are everywhere. Change the lyrical approach to sober up the honest and clever selfindulgence, and you forfeit the angle that makes Art Brut unique and lovable. Pretty up the music too much, and you distract from and compromise Argos' regulardude frontman bit. Merely remake Bang Bang Rock N' Roll, and risk the accusation that the band's concept was only good for one 30minute shot, sentencing the group to the cultband oneanddone footnotes. No wonder the second album is called It's a Bit Complicated. Perhaps aware of this foreboding obstacle course, Art Brut have wisely managed to somehow make all of these mistakes and none of them, incrementally expanding their sonic palette while Argos evinces a slightly more grownup perspective, yet never straying too far from the band's original M.O. Sure, there's a more muscular leadguitar on most tracks here, they've discovered the joys of audible backing vocals, and a horn section even turns up on \"Late Sunday Evening\", but there aren't any illadvised dalliances with laptop beats or orchestration or even, god forbid, ballads. Meanwhile, Argos' muse has perceptibly changed from \"geegolly, I'm in a band!\" and bedroom performance anxiety to domestic living and the simple joy of musiclistening without blunting his wit or giving in to the temptation to talk about fame and touring. The subtle shift is apparent from the very start, as \"Pump Up the Volume\" hangs on a lead riff and an almostsolo more upfront than anything on Bang Bang, albeit far too slowly played to register as overly flashy. Meanwhile, the vocal is classic Argos, amplifying the dilemma of midmakeout radio adjustment to epic proportions, interrupting a kiss to tentatively ask \"have you heard this song before?\" Sexxing is, in fact, on Argos' mind throughout the record, from the courtship drama of \"Direct Hit\" to stayinbedbaby pleadings of \"Blame It on the Trains\". \"Jealous Guy\" is even the polar opposite of the last record's slightly uncomfortable impotence trilogy, finding the singer pleading with his sleepy girlfriend to stay up and frolic while torturing himself with paranoia about her exes.  But more effective than these romantic ruminations are the tracks where Art Brut switches up their metaaware musicaboutmusic tendencies for the better, progressing from songs about making songs to songs about the irresistible urge to build a soundtrack to one's own life. In a way, \"Pump Up the Volume\" fits this category as well; if nothing else, it's about wanting to enhance an already, er, stimulating experience with the proper audio accompaniment. \"Sound of Summer\" is even more direct, fetishizing the process of creating the perfect mixtape in painstaking detail, right down to breaking the tabs \"so you can't tape over it ever.\" The zenith of this subject is clearly reached on \"Nag Nag Nag Nag\", the band's betweenalbums single that amps up the central riff and sunbleached backing vocals to make the song's deadon comingofage headphones drama properly triumphant.  The upgrades in production values aren't always an improvement, however, as it occasionally comes at the sacrifice of the band's scrupulous spontaneity. Argos' selfaware humor is still present pronouncing \"here comes the really good bit!\" in the breakdown of \"Direct Hit\" or apologizing for his Germglish (\"punk rock is nicht tot\") in \"St. Pauli\" but doesn't produce as many bannerwaving oneliners. Moments like \"People in Love\" and \"Post Soothing Out\" are more demure than anything found on the group's debut, and embellishments like the horn breakdown of \"Late Sunday Evening\" are a poor substitute for the homegrown fistpump peaks of older tracks like \"Emily Kane\" and \"Modern Art\".  These missteps are testament to Art Brut's hidden element: the band itself. While Argos draws the spotlight of most reviews (this one included), the rest of the band quietly adds its own crucial element, which at its best is a simple, raucous sound perfect for underscoring melodramatic tales of sex and rock. As \"St. Pauli\" nervously reflects, Art Brut are at heart a throwback punk band albeit one with a frontman that is far more charming, thoughtful, and witty than your typical threechord bashers and two albums down, they're already bumping up against the constraints of that genre. By only gently nudging the musical formula on It's a Bit Complicated, Art Brut have succeeded in crafting a satisfying halfmature sequel, but may have only delayed, rather than thwarted, the sophomore jinx.
