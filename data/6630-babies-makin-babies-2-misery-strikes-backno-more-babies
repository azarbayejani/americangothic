The hirsute Roots drummer is a worldclass DJ, known for seamless sets, and a wellknown musical connoisseur with an overwhelming collection of records. Babies Makin' Babies 2: Misery Strikes Back...No More Babies, like its predecessor, confirms ?uest's credentials. But let's be clear: The first one is a good if somewhat basic getthedrawz mix; this more complex installment, which effortlessly moves from seeming sad to sounding sweet, is even better. A nod to the lovelorn, Babies has its share of blue tunes, like \"Our Love Has Died\", which wallows in selfpity, as Ohio Players' Leroy \"Sugarfoot\" Bonner grieves a failed affair: \"They buried our love, six feet down/ No mourners, no mourners came around.\" His cheerless drawl, set to dirgelike drums, then morphs to fullblown sulkfest. \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\", which sports a lush guitar, is willfully glum. Al Green is asking that which judging by his grief is unanswerable; the song's title may as well be \"How Can You Squeeze Blood From a Stone\". Thankfully, ?uest also includes songs that tell the female side of the story. Syreeta's \"Cause We've Ended Now as Lovers\" is brooding but bighearted. The Stevie Wonder protégé ponders lost innocence over acoustic soul strumming: \"Lovers walking in the rain/ So close, we feel each other's pain/ But now, you say that love has died away.\" None of the standard reproof (which inflames her male contemporaries) is heard in her quiet contralto. On the other hand, Betty Davis' \"Anti Love Song\" seethes with righteous wrath, proving it takes two to tango. While Babies feels complete, it still misses some essentials Marvin Gaye's \"When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You\" would have worked well here; \"Jessica\", by Herbie Hancock, also comes to mind. Then again, those songs are likely too bleak for Babies, whose most melancholic tracks (\"Our Love Has Died\", \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\") are not as dismal; both songs are sweetened by immaculate production. Likewise, Natalie Cole's \"Good Morning Heartache\" has a technicolor, varietyshow grandness that invalidates its woe. At any rate, ?uest achieves a rare combination: a sonic pity party with a soulsoothing sheen. "}
