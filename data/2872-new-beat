{"label":" Some","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/2847/homepage_large.c9e31d1c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Ott","artist":"Exit","title":"New Beat","text":" When did Toad the Wet Sprocket and the Gin Blossoms become key influences on kids with ripped denim jackets and justso stickyup hair? Are The Romantics punk rock icons now? Listening to The Exit's New Beat, it would seem the VH1 sounds of yesteryear are entirely unknown to the deaf, dumb and blind first generation of emo babies, who spent their teens thinking The Get Up Kids were the real deal. I have heard few songs as embarrassing as The Exit's \"Trapped\", which purports a notefornote perjury of The Police classic \"Spirits in the Material World\" before it degenerates into the sort of midtempo balladry once offered by bands as borderline lame as The Buckpets. I have to assume these kids have heard The Police, but it seems in their tactless, tasteless drive to get laid and recognized on college campuses, they could care less what lines they cross. Is it too much to ask that their elders producers, booking agents even family clue these kids in? Wait, what am I asking? They're called \"The Exit\". Originality was never a concern. Four different songs on this record (\"When I'm Free\", \"Still Waiting\", \"Scream and Shout\" and their sad attempt at a dramatic finale, the twochord plod \"Watertown\") could be inserted without alteration into The Gin Blossoms's smooth, postR.E.M. debut, 1992's New Miserable Experience. Yet, the album cover is a picture of a Clash tribute band. The Exit seek a free pass to rock stardom, and if it has any defensible purpose, music criticism strives to prevent bands like this profiting from their own ignorance, or that of their audience. The illiterate use of preexisting imagery, and the shameless musical thefts perpetrated on this record would merit a far lower rating than I've settled on were it not for their passable technical merit, and New Beat's smooth sound, care of famed Ramones producer/collaborator Daniel Rey. It may be a while before I can appreciate the childish glee of \"I Wanna Live\" and \"Pet Semetary\" (Rey cowrote both) without thinking back to this illadvised outing with the cool kids. "}
