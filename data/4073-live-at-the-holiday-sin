And this is a vulgar little record, part loopy and part seedy. In fact, is that motel even a real place? Or is this a Holiday Sin... of the soul? Sharp, former member of New Radiant Storm King and Skinner Pilot, tries to create a twisted vibe, but the record works best when it's good clean rock 'n' roll. The first three songs are terrific: she kicks off \"Dear Krazy\" with a grungy rhythm guitar and nice, driving brushwork she's a great drummer, and she reportedly records every track by starting with the drums. Guest guitarist Caleb Seavey takes a solo that's halfway searing. \"Whatever Turns U On\" speeds over a coarse guitar riff and nicely placed keyboard fills, before Sharp settles down into \"The Static's Beat\" and its broad melody and catchy chorus. And the last track, \"Miami Hurricanes,\" is too long, but it has a Sundayontheboardwalk feel and an acoustic guitar part that's like a warm drizzle. But outside of those tracks, Sharp runs out of ideas. Most of the songs are repetitive maybe starting with the drum parts wasn't such a good idea and while a couple of tracks are raucous or hypnotic, the sound can become claustrophobic, as on the headbeatingly singsong \"Ruler of the Hodom.\" And where's the evil? Sharp tries to sound loony, singing just above a murmur, but the lyrics sound like they come from Liz Phair's ruder younger sister. They swing from the hilariously blunt \"Me & My Babysitter\" (\"Let's play babysitter/ Let me sit on your face\") to the silly, indieasaheartattack \"Yr. Corporate Sponsor\" (\"Yr corporate sponsor sucks dick/ Gives good head\"). The recording sounds lofi and rough, like the wornout motels in Sharp's cover photos. But the arrangements are impeccable: every use of a keyboard or toy xylophone falls right in place, the guitars are flawless, and aside from the frantic turn in \"Jack & Ginger,\" the pace is machinelike. In fact, everything's perfect, but without enough passable songwriting or raw lunacy to carry it: it's nasty, yeah, but not as nasty as promised. "}
