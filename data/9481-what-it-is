{"label":" Rhino","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/9316/homepage_large.33d2a965.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Joe Tangari","artist":"Various Artists","title":"What It Is!","text":"  Consolidation in the music industry has created problems that have manifested themselves both in business and art, but one of the positive side effects of it is on display on What It Is!, the latest in Rhino's campaign to collate the sidelines of music history with fourdisc boxed sets. The subtitle of the box notes that all of the (mostly) obscure funk and soul sides in the tracklist comes from the vaults of just three labels: Atlantic, Atco, and Warner Brothers. Reading the exhaustive track notes, however, reveals a huge list of original issuing labels, including Keymen, Josie, Reprise, Cotillion, Alston, and Kwanza, all of which were either scooped up in acquisitions or distributed by the three title labels, which of course are all owned by the same company today. It's rather nice to have one, welldocumented place to go for such a huge range of funk and soul tracks, and Rhino has taken advantage of it, consolidating things even further to compile what amounts to, as Oliver Wang says in his leadin essay, a \"shadow history of funk.\" These aren't the songs that blew up the charts, though you may have heard a few of them Curtis Mayfield's \"(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below We're All Gonna Go\" or Wilson Pickett's \"Engine Number 9\", for instance. Though the title puts the range of years at 19671977, the vast majority of the songs gathered here came out in the first five years of that span. They're arranged chronologically, and you don't get to 1973 until the sixth track of Disc 4. This is entirely appropriate, because the real window of dirty, nasty funk before it gave way to disco and other, smoother cousins was a relatively short one. Several of the later tracks don't quite fit the spirit of what precedes them, and there's a lot of distance between the simple bounce of organ epiphany on the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band's \"Spreadin' Honey\", released in 1967, and the cosmic, synthheavy stomp of \"Riding High\", recorded in 1977 by the Ohio Players under the name FazeO.  There are names that pop up throughout the generous track notes, and two of the most common are the twin giants of New Orleans r&b, Allen Toussaint and the Meters, who often worked as Toussaint's house band. Both are represented with their own tracks, but Toussaint penned a further seven, and at least a couple of Meters turn up on six tracks credited to other artists. The best of these is a fullon Meters romp, Cyrille Neville's 1970 killer \"Gossip\". The song opens with a towering \"coral sitar\" guitar riff from Leo Nocentelli that injects a heavy dose of psychedelia to accent the rockhard beat.  A few tracks later, you get a real sitar, courtesy of Ananda Shankar's cover of \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\". Shankar was nephew to Ravi, and sold a truckload of LPs grafting virtuoso sitar playing onto psychedelic pop; \"Metamorphosis\" is the funkiest track from his selftitled LP, but \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" is more immediate. On the less frivolous end of things is \"Headless Heroes\" by Eugene McDaniels, from his political funk opus Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse, a record Spiro Agnew personally requested be withdrawn in spite of the fact that almost nobody heard it. When McDaniels refers to us all as \"racial pawns in the master game\" and asserts that \"the player who controls the board sees them all as the same/ Basically cannon fodder,\" you know he means it.  Paranoia rears its head on the dark funk of Baby Huey & the Babysitters' \"Hard Times\", an icy ghetto soul track with a chilling, guitarsoaked intro and lyrics about being held up by someone you thought you trusted. Baby Huey is one of many artists here worth investigating further including the Meters, Curtis Mayfield, Wilson Pickett, Harlem River Drive, Mongo Santamaria, Fred Wesley, King Curtis, and Bobby Byrd. There are, however, a number of artists for whom further investigation is damn near impossible. More than a quarter of the bands included here never released a fulllength album, so the Houseguests' \"What So Never the Dance\" is pretty much it. This is where the value of a set like this really comes into sharp relief Tony Alvon & the Belairs' groover \"Sexy Coffee Pot\" has never been easier to come by than it is with this on the shelves.  Some of the curiosities don't pan out like you might expect Sly Stone's \"I'm Just Like You\", cut during the sessions for There's a Riot Goin' On and released under the name 6ix on Stone Flower, is muddy and you can hear the toll all the drugs were taking. Others, however, deliver like gangbusters: The early Earth, Wind & Fire instrumental \"Hot Tune\" is a blazing slab of hard funk, spiked with African thumb piano and monstrous fuzz bass. A clutch of Latin funk tracks, including Mongo Santamaria's version of the Temptations' \"I Can't Get Next to You\", Harlem River Drive's breakneck \"Seeds of Life\", and Malo's ultrasmooth \"Suavecito\" makes the case that a box of nothing but Latin funk could be extremely rewarding on its own. What It Is! is a thoroughly enjoyable set, and it covers a lot of ground, from political agitation to the pure party groove of the BarKays' \"Soul Finger\". In spite of drawing only from the vaults of three major labels, it's a great introduction to funk for a newcomer looking for a taste and some arrows pointing down roads of further investigation. It's hard to imagine hearing the Beginning of the End's \"Funky Nassau (Part II)\" for the first time and not wanting to shout for joy or just get up and dance, and this box offers that thrill to the uninitiated 91 times.
