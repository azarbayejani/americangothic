{"label":" Atlantic","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13499/homepage_large.645bd662.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tom Breihan","artist":"Juvenile","title":"Reality Check","text":" In the movie Hustle & Flow, there's a moment where DJ Qualls, playing the goofy white beatmaker Shelby, describes Southern rap as the blues coming back home: \"From 'Back Door Man' to 'Back That Azz Up', it's all about one man's pain\" or some bullshit like that. It's a terrible scene, didactic and awkward. But it's interesting that he'd mention \"Back That Azz Up\", considering that Juvenile, the guy who made that track, has the bluesiest voice in rap (apologies to Trick Daddy): a weary singsong swampgrowl, all drawnout halfswallowed vowels and rasping New Orleans Creole wavers. And now that acts of God and governmental neglect have effectively leveled Juvenile's hometown, that voice has a tragic context.Reality Check, Juvenile's seventh album, opens with \"Get Ya Hustle On\", a Hurricane Katrina diatribe as broken and confused as it is enraged. Over chilly harpsichord plinks and foghorn bass, he seesaws wildly between political invective (\"Fuck Fox News; I don't listen to y'all ass/ Couldn't get a nigga off the roof when the storm passed\") and crackdealer bluster (\"Get ya mind right, nigga, get ya money up/ You're moving a little something, but you ain't done enough\"). With this one track, Juvenile throws the past year's rampant traprap trend into shockingly sharp relief; how fatalistic must you be to advocate drugdealing for posthurricane recovery? Nothing else on Reality Check references Hurricane Katrina directly, but \"Get Ya Hustle On\" puts the rest of the album in a weird light. On \"Sets Go Up\", the album's best song, Juvenile snarls hometown pride over Scott Storch's masterfully spacey drums and synthbleeps: \"New Orleans, see I'ma rep that cause these my peeps/ You could pick up some bad habits hangin' in these streets.\" But then, in Southern rap, it's not so much about what you say as how you say it, and so on \"Rodeo\", the bleakly guttural moans and gorgeously fragile Cool & Dre track resonate far more than the track's straightignorant stripclub lyrics.  For all its fatalism, though, Reality Check is still a commercial Southern rap album, and it has certain obligations to fulfill as such, so it has a few songs about butts and cough syrup, and a small army of rappers making guest appearances and plenty of threats to kill you. On its own merits, it's pretty great. Many of the beats come from the relative unknown Sinista, whose muffled drum thumps, streaky organs, and prim synthwhistles give the album a bright, warm cohesion; this stuff is only going to sound better when summer arrives. Most of the guests acquit themselves well, especially Skip, a member of Juve's new U.T.P. clique who raps in an selfaggrandizing nasal bark, something like Dave Chappelle's Rick James voice. At more than an hour, the album is too long; it would be much better without a few of its secondhalf tracks, especially the garbage Brian McKnight collaboration \"Addicted\". Reality Check never quite transcends its genre, but Juvenile's resonant sadness always sets it apart. The album's closing track \"Say It to Me Now\" may be a dis against Juvenile's former fellow Hot Boy Lil Wayne, but it's more despondent than it is angry; not many beef songs end with anguished conversations with God.
