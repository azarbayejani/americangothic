But it's also the season of the \"arthouse monster movie\" at least in the words of The Wall Street Journal (I know!). Among the latest snobspookers: South Korean director Bong JoonHo's The Host, Thai duo Oxide and Danny Pang's ReCycle, and The Exorcist guy's fresh Harry Connick Jr./Ashley Judd creepout, Bug. All picked up Cannes plaudits, though probably fewer than Al Gore. It's also \"the summer of Sound Team\" at least in the words of one media outlet. As blog memes go, praise for the Austin sextet isn't as ubiquitous as your aforementioned forthcoming herpetological thriller, but in Hype Machine circles it's not that far off. As with the new arty fright flicks, Sound Team's first proper fulllength Movie Monster tries hard to straddle between blockbuster and cult classic, flashing a dizzying array of instantcred reference points like so much majorlabel bling and piling on rubedazzling special effects. Most popcornthriller misfires lack the plot and character to match their sound and fury; Movie Monster's adenoidal overemoting and WalloftheEdge guitars can't hide a shortage of, like, actual decent songs. To be sure, Movie Monster has plenty to offer Next Big Thingspotters. Like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah last year, Sound Team open things with a blinkandyou'llmissit song fragment, though their \"Get Out\" is more U2 anthem particularly \"With or Without You\" than CYHSY carny busk. Just as Tapes 'n Tapes endearingly namechecked Harvard Square on this year's The Loon, Sound Team drop in another reallife locale, Portland's Burnside Ave., amid the Wilcoesque Americana of organdriven single \"Back in Town\". Then there's the hipster roll call of influences: Stereolab and Lowera Bowie (and thus Krautrock motorik) throughout, plus Loveless shimmer on \"Afterglow Years\", Gang of Rapturous Franz discopunk on marblemouthed \"TV Torso\", and singer/guitarist Matt Oliver's strangled Walkmen/Creed croak. Yes, they opened for Arcade Fire in Central Park. But Win was only returning a favor.  Amid blurry soundscapes produced by Mike McCarthy (Spoon, Trail of Dead), Sound Team hack together Yankee Kid A Foxtrot nonsense lyrics and the kind of vague melodies sure to leave you humming the video. \"All of the bedrooms fold into the Perfect Chair\", Oliver repeats between Policetinged verses on \"Born to Please\". Meanwhile, \"Your Eyes Are Liars\" is pretty much gardenvariety postElefant 1980s nostalgia, substituting hoarse bravado for Mozzy croon. Extra points for working both Kafka and Trinitrons into the big, desolate \"No More Birthdays\". Finally, the ringing drone of lofty closer \"Handful of Billions\" unveils the Bonosized ambitions lurking beneath the album's more fashionable styleshifting. \"Let the backlash begin,\" Oliver tries elsewhere, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's going to be a long summer.  For all the cinematic sonic touches, Sound Team's eponymous \"monster\" is, like Sasquatch, pretty hard to follow. At last, on the sinister, electronicsladen title track, with ghostly harmonies out of a subpar TV on the Radio outtake, Oliver screamowails that \"the movie monster was mechanical\" and he could easily be describing his band's rote reiteration of snazzy influences. Sometimes you meet the monster, and it is you. And sometimes there are mothafuckin' snakes on this mothafuckin' plane.  "}
