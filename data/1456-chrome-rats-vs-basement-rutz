Upon raising the bottle to her face for one more swig before returning to the floor, she felt a tap on her shoulder and a chorus of voices ask her, \"Excuse me, is this seat taken?\" Stefani turned her head, and saw behind her the entire group that had just finished their set, The Chromatics. \"Uhm,\" she hesitantly replied, \"no, it's not, go ahead.\" \"Excellent. We're really thirsty after that show. Would you like something to drink as well?\" the band asked. A long silence ensued while the bartender fetched four beers for the group. \"Right... can I ask why you all are wearing an oversized sweater with four neckholes cut into it? And why are you speaking in unison and wearing those ducttape anklets?\" \"Our psychiatrist says we need to focus on building our team skills,\" said the band. \"She says it will help us salve our artistic wounds.\" Stefani rolled her eyes. That's all she needed was to get hit on by yet another creatively divided band. She shuddered as she remembered her sordid affair with Wilco the previous year. STRIKE ONE  \"SO,\" the Chromatics said, \"those are nice, exaggerated cuff darkdenim jeans you have there.\" They paused for effect before adding, \"They'd look better on my van floor, though.\" \"UGH, are you serious?!\" Stefani had to set her drink down. \"Is that your opening line? Aside from being completely crass and inappropriate, it's as old as my dad!\" \"We take pride in vulgar displays of animal lust, though,\" the band argued, \"and we think there's nothing wrong with borrowing from the past.\" \"That's an understatement. I heard your new album, Chrome Rats vs Basement Rutz, and it's raw to say the least. It sounds like The Godz after 24hour exposure to Gang of Four, The Stooges circa Raw Power, and The Fall.\" \"Yeah, we feel that the tracks wear their influences like badges of honor,\" the group said before elaborating, \"We trade the catcalls and the angular honkytonk guitar of The Fall on 'Skill Fall', drag the burden of feedback akin to Sonic Youth on 'Plastic Kross', and finally utilize American dissidence with the copped Wipers tune 'Felt Tongue'.\" Stefani perked up, \"Isn't that one of the tracks that The Blood Brothers' Johnny Vade covocals? I've had my eye on him ever since the popular press started to notice the band. Where is he?\" \"Oh, well, you see,\" the band scratched their collective heads. \"He, uh, doesn't return our phone calls now.\" STRIKE TWO  Stefani tried to think of something to say to break the awkward silence. She finally declared, \"I appreciate the tangential no waveinspired support of sexual equality that you all attempt, allowing the girls to share equivalent stagetime with the boys, especially on tracks like 'Hannah's Song'. It boasts the closest connection on the album to my favorite influential groups like Ut, Y Pants, and The Raincoats, though I don't understand why you couldn't do more with the sound and content, steering away from the clich√©s of grrlrock.\" \"Our effort was really on the lyrics in those songs, though, focusing the experimental energy into lines like, 'We pose a threat to undermine your dominance,' and, 'You ought to stick it in and show me what a man can do,' and leaving the song structure at a really basic style...\" \"I was curious as to why you only allowed the girls to shine in a stereotyped Kim Gordongrowl. Don't you worry that lyrics like that will peg the songs as secondgeneration Bikini Kill fodder? And why should the woman's role be defined by sexual views while the men get to opine and politick about everything from government policy to music history? The more I think about it, the more the songs sound like loosely tackedon genderspecific apologies that work only to get the band laid.\" The band stared blankly into their drinks before raising their heads with a wideeyed grin and asking, \"Is it working?\" STRIKE THREE  Stefani picked up her buttoncovered messenger's bag and made her way back to the stage. She never saw the band again, but she heard that they followed the No New York personalities' trend of imploding before the official release of any substantial body of work, leaving behind only remnant members and a slew of other NY bands to carry the torch of arty and ambiguous musicianship into the future. She thought to herself how sad it was that if they'd only been given the benefit of time the band could have eventually surpassed their dependence on immaturity and hindsight, and ultimately not have fallen prey to both her rejection and their own. Though she moved on with her life currently dating the Yeah Yeah Yeahs Stefani never forgot that magical moment she shared with a band that burned out just when they were getting interesting. "}
