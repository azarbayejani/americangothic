Most artists would take some time off after releasing a record as allout, ballstothewall ambitious as this year's dazzling Cosmogramma, his most recent fulllength as Flying Lotus. Yet here we are three months later, with a new EP, the seventrack Pattern + Grid World. Between this and Ellison's constant stream of remixes for other artists, it's hard to imagine when he finds time to sleep.Unlike those remixes, which mostly fall between the range of good and competent, Pattern + Grid World sounds fully formed and precisely assembled. That shouldn't be surprising, considering Ellison's growing reputation as an album artist, but the fact that early single \"Camera Day\" originally made an appearance as the backbeat for Killer Mike's \"Swimming\" in June hinted that this release might wind up more of an oddsandends set. However, Pattern + Grid World feels as much like a complete work as its fulllength predecessor, from the enginerevving opener \"Clay\" to the squelching closer \"Physics For Everyone!\" And this despite its ultrashort (barely 19 minutes) runtime.Because of its brevity, the EP serves a solid entry point to Flying Lotus' work. Perhaps the only serious complaint that could be lodged against Cosmogramma is that it was daunting too dense, complicated, and harsh for casual listeners and firsttime beat freaks. This EP, by contrast, feels a bit like Baby's First Brainfeeder: you've got the speedaddled drum'n'bass freakout (\"Kill Your CoWorkers\"), the offkilter postDilla thumper (\"Time Vampires\"), and a midsection so swampy that you can practically see the flies hovering above the surface (\"Jurassic Notion / M Theory\").Which isn't to say that this is a beginnersonly record. There's plenty of detail to revel in on Pattern + Grid World new surprises are unlocked with every listen. The chintzy \"Amen\" break that serves as a foundation for the 8bit expansiveness of \"Kill Your CoWorkers\" might be recognizable from that first skittering breakbeat. But it takes a few listens to realize that the wobbly horn amidst percussion of \"Jurassic Notion\" has an enticing riff reminiscent of Missy Elliott protégé Tweet's \"Oops (Oh My)\". Elsewhere, revelations are found in the synth lines that twist above the lowriding beat on \"Camera Day\", and the rigid snareandhihat abstractions of \"PieFace\". For now, FlyLo's well of invention looks to be in no danger of running dry. "}
