The duo continues to appear on almost any bill, in front of any crowd, in any town, and if you haven't seen their names on a local listings, you might know them from their collaborations with the men of the Mae Shi, remixing their \"Run to Your Grave\" for the HLLYEA EP. Though their kindred spirits are a little left of traditional notions of hiphop, Kid Static still lays nimble, easygoing rhymes over the dense and busy production of Yea Big, who also plays the gawky, sweatbandandgymshort adorned hypeman for Static on stage. Whether you're a fan of glitchinspired scifi rap production or not, Yea Big's work here is a potent argument for continuing to work the niche: it's always chintzy and threatening, robotic and organic, teethgritting and headbobbing all at once.The tracks on The Future's Looking Grim were sent back and forth between the two principals, Postal Servicestyle, but you wouldn't know it from hearing it. The chemistry is still enough that Kid Static knows when to lead the track and when to let it pop, squelch, and thump on its own. There's a social message that occasionally creeps in from the sidelines (they carry \"two barrels of beats\" and are \"supersoakin with guns, not with skeetin\" in \"Middle America\"), and yet Kid Static is becoming a strong enough MC that his flow alone is as compelling as the content. It's evident on the frenetic Nintendo beat of \"Stomp the Pedal\" that hides more thump and open space in its second return, while Kid Static's doubletime flow and breathless inflection show his growth as a rapper. The same goes for when he slows down: \"The Nameless\" has him taking namedropping to the most absurd heights possible while rhyming \"alphabet\" with \"CoxArquette.\" It's a concept that might read as corny, but is exactly the kind of thing that can transform folded arms into smiles in an unfamiliar crowd.Yea Big, meanwhile, is all over the place jumping into juke in the outro of the opening track, providing giddy postNeptunes bounce underneath the chiptastic \"Mega Man\" valentine \"Bots\", receding into harsh static in the closing moments of the darker \"Dollar Bill Hat\", and combining jazzy hihat tapping with distorted bass hits in \"Rock Bottom Rock\". The fact that Kid Static can even keep up, let alone find a way in to these tracks, is saying something. Sonically, the album veers between a more relaxed and confident reiteration of the busybutlaidback rap of their first record and tracks that build an icy tension in their glitchier moments. Goosebumps are raised as bicyclespoke percussion floats through an otherwise silent moment before the refrain of \"Down to the River\", and paranoia lurks over the shoulder of the nightmareinspired \"Long Night\". Even \"Middle America\", which could easily be a theme song for the group, sounds a little tense and beleaguered.Though it's not completely fair to harp on a song that's more than a year old by now, \"Eatchyo Samwich\" is a good summation of Yea Big + Kid Static's strengths: they're usually at their best when they're smiling, and most potent when the track has just a little breathing room in this case, an unusually slinky beat that carries a ridiculous, occasionally uncomfortable extended riff on foodinspired braggadocio, with Static adopting a lanternjaw toughguy voice that rivals his regular tone. Yet even \"Samwich\" isn't quite the same without the presong anecdote Static delivers when they play it live. The icy pessimism of the record is compelling, but \"Samwich\" and \"The Nameless\" hint at how irrepressible and charming these guys are, and how they're comfortable in front of any audience. Above all else, the group is serious about being silly, and it's hard to get what they're about without seeing them dive into a crowd, scale a venue's walls, or turn their backs to the audience for some Supremesworthy dance moves. Fortunately, The Future's Looking Grim comes a little closer to capturing that spirit. "}
