They chose the business route, launching a suite of enterprises collectively called Apple Corps, most of which were boondoggles. Apple Electronics was a disaster; Apple Studio was a joke; the Apple Boutique lasted seven months before they gave up and announced that they were simply giving away the rest of their stock. Apple Records might have been a similarly dubious idea the Beatles weren't short of hangerson, and the label's roster was heavily populated by longtime pals of the group and curiosities they decided to release on a whim. But if the Beatles knew how to do one thing, it was make records, and almost everything in the Apple discography is somewhere between \"interesting\" and \"superb.\"This onedisc singles compilation, spanning 19681972, isn't quite what its title promises: The Beatles' post\"Hey Jude\" records, and their early solo records, aren't on here. (It's being released alongside reissues of most of Apple's notBeatlesorYoko album catalogue.) Still, they're all over it. Paul McCartney wrote the winning oompah instrumental \"Thingumybob\" for the Black Dyke Mills Band and \"Goodbye\" for Mary Hopkin, and he told Badfinger they could have his new song \"Come and Get It\" if they played it notefornote like his demo. George Harrison wrote \"Try Some, Buy Some\" for exRonette Ronnie Spector and the explosive rocker \"Sour Milk Sea\" for his old Liverpool pal Jackie Lomax. (The backing band on the latter includes George, Paul, Ringo Starr, and Eric Clapton; recorded during the White Album sessions, it would've been one of the best songs on that record if George had kept it for himself.)The Beatles were canny judges of popular taste, too, and this set includes a handful of hits that have been out of circulation for years, thanks to the Apple catalogue's being in limbo. Mary Hopkin's \"Those Were the Days  \" was No. 2 in the U.S. (and bumped \"Hey Jude\" off the top  of the British charts); Billy Preston's \"That's the Way God Planned It\" and \"My Sweet Lord\" (recorded before Harrison's own version), Chris Hodge's glamrock boogie \"We're on Our Way\", and Badfinger's \"Come and Get It\" and \"Day After Day\" all made the charts in America.What makes Come and Get It really fun, though, is the same thing that made the Beatles' own Apple releases particularly entertaining: their willingness to go to bat for totally uncommercial ideas. George managed to get the Radha Krishna Temple on \"Top of the Pops\", released a single by the Cajun band the Sundown Playboys just because he liked it, and made a nifty album with thenforgotten American soul singer Doris Troy (represented here by the single \"Ain't That Cute\"). Paul played bass on the debut single by thenunknown folk singer James Taylor. John Lennon (and Yoko Ono) wrote a benefit single for the underground newspaper Oz, \"God Save Us\", released by Bill Elliot and the Elastic Oz Band (aka John, Ringo, and Klaus Voorman).There are a couple of outright duds here, especially Brute Force's onejoke \"King of Fuh\" which George had pressed up with an Apple label despite (or maybe because of) the fact that no store would dare to carry it in 1969 and a cranky reggae cover of \"Give Peace a Chance\" by Hot Chocolate Band (who'd do much better once they dropped the last word from their name). Still, this is a fascinating document of one of the most adventurous labels of its era, built around a group so creatively fertile that they could pass their own mojo on to almost everyone they worked with.
