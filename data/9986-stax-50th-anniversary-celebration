Deusner","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Stax 50th Anniversary Celebration","text":"  It's telling that Stax Records was located in an old theatre. The music made at 926 E. McLemore Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, emphasized soulful performance above pop poise, with the sweaty spontaneity of the moment always underscoring the intensity of romantic, social, sexual, or musical needs. On the new, 2xCD Stax 50th Anniversary Celebration, you can hear this unscripted quality in Isaac Hayes punctuating a verse of Bacharach and David's \"Walk on By\" with \"you socked it to me, mama!\" or for Mavis Staples singing along with the guitar solo on \"If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)\". It's impossible to imagine Rufus Thomas writing down any lyrics to \"Walking the Dog\" and \"Do the Funky Chicken\", two of his best novelty dance songs. Linda Lyndell even made up the verses to \"What a Man\" on the spot, improvising lyrics almost as she sang them. Nearly all of the label's early songs were recorded live in that converted theatre studio, a practice born out of necessity rather than aesthetic principle but which nevertheless emphasized the latter. In fact, the label, which was founded in 1957 by former country musician Jim Stewart (ST) and his sister Estelle Axton (AX), kept things inhouse, so Stax refers not just to the label and its snappingfingers logo, but also the studio itself and the musicians who congregated there. Booker T. & the MG's, the house band, typically played on most early tracks, occasionally with Isaac Hayes on organ or piano and the MarKeys providing those readily identifiable Memphis horns (the group's key players would later become known as the Memphis Horns). Hayes, from nearby Covington, Tennesse, and Memphian David Porter teamed up to write many of the label's bestknown songs, like Sam & Dave's \"Soul Man\" and \"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby\" (the latter criminally omitted from this set). Together, all the musicians kept the songs preternaturally tight and targeted, with no fills or showboating, just pure, chugging r&b momentum that is almost businesslike in its precision. As the label developed its sound and its studio, bringing in professional composers and arrangers during the early 1970s, this dynamic all but disappeared, but songs like Jean Knight's \"Mr. Big Stuff\", Mel & Tim's \"Starting All Over Again\", and Hayes' decadedefining \"Theme from Shaft\" prove that the label's musical standard remained high. The practice of recording live in the studio, often with all the musicians gathered around only one mic, captured the performers' group dynamic along with wrong notes, missed cues, and other enlivening mistakes that reveal the studio's technical primitiveness. This might explain the absence from Stax 50th of Otis Redding's iconic \"Try a Little Tenderness\", whose big finale falls away as the horns fail to complete their crescendo surely a production error. Also missing is Albert King's \"Crosscut Saw\", a rumbling blues number with vocals buried low in the mix. However, these imperfections make those songs sound even more raw and urgent forty years later, the creations of real musicians in a real studio. Furthermore, the fourminute single version of Isaac Hayes' stellar \"Walk on By\" included here is a mere trophy compared to the towering monument of the twelveminute version, and anyone familiar with Hayes' breakthrough 1969 album Hot Buttered Soul will be able to pick out the splices. The list of noticeable omissions is long: Hayes' \"Do Your Thing\", Sam & Dave's \"Wrap It Up\" or \"I Thank You\", Redding's \"Hard to Handle\", and on and on and on.  Happily, Stax 50th gets more things right than wrong. The tracklist is commendable, with choice cuts from Sam & Dave, the MarKeys, Eddie Floyd, the Staple Singers, Soul Children, and Jean Knight, showcasing the label's range as well as its musical and technological development over the years. Johnnie Taylor's \"Jody's Got Your Girl and Gone\", with its inverted callandresponse chorus, may be channeling Curtis Mayfield, but that doesn't dilute its double indictment of men who don't take care of their women and men who take others' women. Likewise, the Staple Singers' \"If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)\" may be a rewrite of their hit \"I'll Take You There\", but that doesn't make it any less transcendent. Too bad it's followed by Taylor's \"Cheaper to Keep Her\", a gimmick track that sounds the comp's only sour note. But bad transitions are a consequence of chronological sequencing; ultimately, this set contains one incredible song after another: the BarKays' effervescent \"Soulfinger\", Albert King's doomboogie \"Born Under a Bad Sign\", Booker T. & the MG's percolating \"Time Is Tight\", Soul Children's heartbreakingly resigned \"I'll Be the Other Woman\", and fortysix more.  Overextended even considering its string of hits, Stax closed in 1976 under the weight of accumulating debt, and the historic building on McLemore Avenue was eventually demolished, an act long considered indicative of the city's misplaced cultural priorities. Despite this tragic end, Stax 50th sounds utterly triumphant and why shouldn't it? A few years after the founding of the Stax Museum of American Soul Music on the studio's original site, the label has been revived in conjunction with the Concord Music Group, and has already signed Angie Stone, Soulive, and, best of all, Isaac Hayes. They'll have a large legacy to live up to: The 50 tracks on Stax 50th are merely a fraction of the label's amazing output, making this a fine introduction and hopefully a gateway for many listeners into its massive catalog.
