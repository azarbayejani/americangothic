{"label":" Badman","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/4632/homepage_large.f5873c64.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jason Nickey","artist":"Lanterna","title":"Elm Street","text":" To poorly paraphrase John Cage from his book Silence, if you pay close enough attention, anything can become interesting, and a source of inspiration. It's only when we try to ignore something say, a sound that it becomes annoying or boring. I'm not sure of the universality of that statement, but such is the case with Champaign, Illinois' Laterna on its longdelayed sophomore album, Elm Street. All instrumental, and performed exclusively on guitar, ARP synth, and drum kit, Elm Street features 12 ambient, minimalist treks through inner and outer space. If you allow them, the songs will just kind of hang there like an old landscape painting in your grandmother's parlor that no one ever looks at. But if you're in the right frame of mind (maybe after a couple cups of coffee), the record immerses you in a idyllic, windswept world of sound. It's the kind of music that might accompany a film adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine: safe and sentimental, while simultaneously implying a darker, harsher world. The album begins with the title track, which starts with a finely picked acoustic guitar pattern, slowly fading cymbal crashes (if you can even call them crashes) and distant droning. It's got a pastoral, quaint, and jovial quality that makes it sound like segue music from \"Northern Exposure.\" \"BMinor\" is next, introducing an electrified, U2sounding guitar jangle to the mix that sticks around for nearly the entire album, its echo and reverb set on maximum. The next set of songs \"Spirits,\" \"Thirty,\" and \"Departure\" indistinguishably meld into one elongated cycle, undercutting the playful, jovial vibe of the first two tracks with an increasingly eerie and spooky buildup, and making greater use of the ARP. By the time the creepy, scifisounding \"Old Seattle\" comes around, the guitar has virtually been abandoned. But then it's quickly back to Earth with \"Wolves,\" which as might be guessed, uses some cheesy FX to mimic a certain lupine howl. \"Smoke,\" with its galloping rhythm, is the sound trying to get home before nightfall, while \"Saturn's Rings,\" despite its otherworldly title, sounds more like that nightfall slowly settling in, like it does on long summer days. \"New Moon\" returns to the acoustic ambience of the leadoff track minus the drums, while \"Glass\" is the exact opposite: as the closest thing to a \"rocker\" you're gonna get with this album, the song's drums come out of hibernation and there's even a touch of distortion on the guitar. \"Dog Days\" rounds out the album with a 12minute patiencetester that fades out with the latesummer drones of cicada and cricket chirps a nice touch to cap off the album, but a bit long to wait for it. Upon first listen, I mistook Lanterna's brand of slowpaced sonic sculpture for new age music, and they do lean in that direction from time to time, veering dangerously close to \"Songs of the Whale\" territory. But after a few times through, I saw something closer to Fripp/Eno or even instrumental Felt, though not nearly as layered as the former and not as chiming and rifforiented as the latter. And though the band is still a long way from such minimalist masters as Glass, Reich, or Riley, they still successfully manage to do a whole lot within the very narrow confines they've set for themselves.
