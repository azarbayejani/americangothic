{"label":" End Up","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/13031/homepage_large.1c183ca1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ben Westhoff","artist":"Caithlin De Marrais","title":"My Magic City","text":" During their decadeplus existence Rainer Maria held a certain corner of the sensitive Englishmajor circuit down. Like boy/girl outfits Mates of State and Georgie James, who have found success with hard/soft vocal combinations, poppy arrangements, and elegant poetry about existential despair, Rainer Maria got their yin/yang balance right most of the time. They dissolved in 2006, and former member Kyle Fischer released a solo album earlier this year called Black Milk. Fischer went deeply internal on this winning record, wrapping his songs in layers of dense postproduction.The solo debut from another Rainer Maria alum, Caithlin De Marrais, has nothing to hide behind, however. Though also coproduced and engineered by Fischer (De Marrais' exboyfriend), My Magic City has minimal overdubs and really consists of little more than her voice. Okay, technically, there are unobtrusive acoustic guitar parts and soft piano, but her pipes are nearly always frontandcenter in the songs. This is understandable. On Rainer Maria records, or when she performs with Brooklynbased collective Balthrop, Alabama, her firstrobinoftheseason melodies are almost always memorable. But whereas in those situations her voice serves as an antidote to those of her lesssilky male counterparts', on My Magic City it's pretty much all her all the time, and occasionally the whole cuppa joe is too sugary.The songs are mostly live studio performances recorded in locations including a Carroll Gardens Episcopal church, an upstate cottage, and De Marrais' own apartment. There's no doubt the other players good friends and neighbors, most all have an easy rapport with her and complement each other well. But in spots the album could use more friction, both in the music and the words. \"Like a watch that I wound until I broke a spring/ Like a lock in a door in which I've broken off the key/ Now I'm holding her heart and I'm risking everything,\" she begins on \"Carefully\", suggesting that conflict lies ahead. But no. \"Let me be true,\" she continues. \"And let me be gentle where there is a gentle need/ Let me love this girl/ Let me love her carefully.\" Through much of the album one wishes she wasn't quite so gentle.Still, it's easy to appreciate her chops, and the tracks that offer narrative intrigue make the disc worthwhile. \"I hate to think of all the time we wasted talking about your crimes/ It's 2 a.m., and there goes the phone again,\" she sings on \"Voicemail\". \"And when mom was in the hospital/ We came to visit one and all/ But you refused to go/ What were you thinking?\" (True that, ya jerk.) Closer \"April You Changed Your Mind\", meanwhile, has a driving, insistent quality that demands the listener's attention, like a soft slap to the face. One wishes the rest of the work was similarly aggressive. "}
