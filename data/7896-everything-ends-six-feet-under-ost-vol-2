{"label":" Astralwerks","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/7772/homepage_large.469f2f7d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Dahlen","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Everything Ends: Six Feet Under OST Vol. 2","text":" As the most flawed of HBO's flagship dramas, \"Six Feet Under\" is both the most familiar and most difficult to take. The characters nail every tic and whiny habit that we hate in ourselves, from feeling bad about feeling bad, to guilt over privilege, to minor acts of cowardice or selfishness, to the onagain, offagain relationships that wheeze but never die. Remember the scene in Season 3 when Nate Fischer, who can't bring himself to go home to his new wife, pulls over by the side of the road and beats off? Somebody should have won an Emmy for that. And yet every episode offers a few moments that break through the wallowing to show something special and even inspiring, the kind of human moment that you see coming but that you like regardless. And I feel something similar about the setlist of this compilation, the second \"Six Feet Under\" soundtrack: On paper, it spends too much time on commercial, familiar adult pop and too little on edgy rock; in practice, the predictable songs hold up the best. Take Coldplay. I'm as sick of them as the next guy, and actually, I blame television dramas for their overexposure: It seems like every show on the air pulls out \"Trouble\" or \"Clocks\" when the characters have to look extraintrospective, and whenever I hear Chris Martin's voice I think, \"acting crutch.\" But on Everything Ends, \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" builds to an easy, reflective climax that leaves room to breathe and along with tunes like Phoenix's \"Everything Is Everything\" and \"Amazing Life\" by Jem (who sounds like a flirtier Dido), it rounds off a good dinner party mix. \"Amazing Life\" is the one of four exclusive cuts on the soundtrack, and it's the only one that earned its paycheck. Interpol contributes \"Direction\", a mostly instrumental cut that sounds like betweenscene incidental music, and the Caesars cover of \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" stands solidly in the shadow of the original. Meanwhile, the exclusive that has scored the most attention so far is the Arcade Fire's \"Cold Wind\". Arcade Fire are big and they write about dead people, so you can see the brand synergy; but aside from an arch melody, the song seems like a throwaway and its ambience is too snowedin and Win Butler's voice, too Grizzly Adamslike for Six Feet Under's SoCal setting.Everything Ends flows as casually as if the entire Fischer family grabbed a handful of albums for the car, and sometimes the collisions are bizarre young Claire's overwraught choice of Radiohead's \"Lucky\", bumps into Irma Thomas' \"Time Is On My Side\", no doubt a childhood fave for matriarch Ruth Fischer. (The only flatout dud: eight minutes of Death Cab for Cutie's \"Transatlanticism\"? Dammit Nate!) Random but cozy, it's a fitting souvenir for the show, especially at the end: If you watch the show enough to remember the song \"Lonely Little Petunia\", you'll love Imogen Heap's brief and eerily spacious rendition, which closes the album on a note that's both bittersweet and creepysweet the kind of moment we'll miss after \"Six Feet Under\" is gone.
