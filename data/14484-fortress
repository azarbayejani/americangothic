{"label":" Modern Art","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/15544/homepage_large.962728c4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Zach Kelly","artist":"Miniature Tigers","title":"Fortress","text":" When a band tries on as many different hats as Miniature Tigers do on their sophomore LP, Fortress, it can raise a red flag. The Brooklynbased foursome spends a lot of time here stylepinching, connecting dots already drawn by contemporary indie acts. And yet Miniature Tigers are often able to pull it off. By incorporating elements outside the realm of the nofrills indie pop they're grounded, they show a genuine interest in exploring avantgarde folk, woozy psych, and abstracted electronic pop. You can still see, however, where these ideas are being plucked from.Opener \"Mansion of Misery\" (inspired by The Shining) adds smatterings of percussion and noisy, confused electronics before squeezing out a little Liarslike thrash. Neon Indianassisted single \"Gold Skull\" feels blissful and natural, while the otherwise stonerific \"Rock n' Roll Mountain Troll\" channels Vampire Weekend on high alert. What could have been a cheap stab at poaching new listeners becomes a respectful exercise in toying with popular sounds. But songs like \"Bullfighter Jacket\" and \"Lolita\" both exemplify how stylistic appropriation (in these cases, we're talking Animal Collective) can often look like posturing. Neither are unenjoyable songs: \"Bullfighter Jacket\" recalls earlier, 'roundthecampfire AnCo, complete with those otherworldly \"ayayayay\"s, while the sparkling gypsy vibe of \"Lolita\" goes so far as to lift a vocal melody from Panda Bear's \"Take Pills\". They break very little new ground, and only the most unfamiliar ears will be able to find something of substance to latch onto here.Even when the band's fondness for shadow play doesn't pan out, it's still better than the more traditional, Nick & Norah indie fare that really stalls the album. It's encouraging to hear them cherrypick former tour mates like Spinto Band and, especially on \"Dark Tower\", the Morning Benders (whose vocalist Chris Chu also guests here). Not to mention frontman Charlie Brand's shy, echoladen voice, which is the real star here. If only he had the better sense to know that sometimes restraint and careful footing can really wash a record out. "}
