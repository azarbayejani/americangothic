People pay to be at his shows so they can shout insults at him; reviewers have written of their desires to smack him around. I'll readily admit that he's flung some inscrutable splorp into record store bins, and that he needs to have that Pubescent Perry Farrell DNA extracted, but his last two unctuous, rewarding freakouts, recorded under the guises of Owls and now Friend/Enemy, lead me to ask: what does Kinsella have to do for people to take his afflicted noise seriously? Commit suicide? Be Japanese? In addition some of his usual collaborators from Owls, Cap'n Jazz and Joan of Arc, the twelve contributors to Ten Songs include members of Califone, Need New Body, and 90 Day Men, among other acts. The story is that Kinsella and Joan of Arc's Todd Mattei first developed the vocals and guitars, and then the rest of the merry ol' gang were brought in to add coils of organ, banjo, drums, pedal steel, bass, marimba, etc. Look ma, four pianists! Even without prior knowledge of the project's genesis, listeners can deduce that this album is a collision of premeditation and improvisation, of composed pieces and spontaneous seizures, of the ripe and the rotten. Every libertine musician here is destroying the village in order to save it, and the resulting songs contain megaspectrums whose shambles hunch beside their pristinery imagine Gastr del Sol with a mean low end. Festering chords (weird, open, and minor) bulge from capillary riffs imagine Mick Turner overdubbing Slint while a toddler twiddles the pitchshifter. The feedback on \"Cough Soft Cock Rock/How Do You Explain Me to Your Mom\" seems manufactured from something organic under duress, maybe the old slats of a marina creaking. The drone, strum, and keys of \"Out at the Inner (Dark)\" blend impossibly with clamorous drum rolls that sound studioyears away. I could go on and on about how willingly and edifyingly this music can dovetail, collapse, and spaz, how Zappatrocious it is, how jawdroppingly the organs roam, how the upbeat moments sound like Canned Heat with botulism, or about how the escalating jazzpunk of \"I'd Rather Be High Than Get Laid/Fucked Any Day of the Week\" is flatout bitchin'. But that'd overlook how the lyrics step up as well, imagist and longing. \"Teeny Comealong\" ends with a propulsive catalog of discarded standards: \"Feeling is too easy/ Leaving is too easy/ Quiet is too easy/ Esteem is too easy/ Dead is too easy/ Easy is too easy/ Jealousy is too easy/ Friends is too easy/ Keeping is too easy/ Responsibility is too easy/ Escaping is too easy/ Ending is too easy.\" Absurdists can only laugh so long until the horror paralyzes them, and lemme just say that Kinsella's ripped yelp of \"I hate my thin top lip!\" during \"Do the Stand on the One Foot Dance to the Radio Rodeo\", for all its superimposition, puts the fauxtrauma of Bright Eyes' photoopera to shame. One gets the feeling that Kinsella couldn't give a green damn about his haircut. Friend/Enemy is not so much a step back from Owls as it is a cryptic lope away. And yes, there are some winceworthy moments (a friend, proving the abundance of haters, described it as \"extravagant crap\"). But the band's failures are failures of restraint, not of imagination. If you come to this website to find out what Ryan Adams is up to, this crotchety album's not for you. Ten Songs is the opposite of pop. Pop strives for frozen moments, not this album's long thaw. Pop's a pacifier, offering us an unremarkable assortment of distractions from death; this album is excited about decay. Ten Songs isn't a demographicmaking commercial for anything; it's a distillation of uncanny arrangements with almost no sense of audience. Hell, the last time I saw Kinsella live, he minilectured about the Middle East while the crowd called him gay and unemployed. This stuff's what plays in the lobby of a unicorn abortion clinic, except for the almost traditionally pretty but equally complicated \"Just Like Ann E. Fay's Blues\" and \"Okay We'll Fade Before the End\" (despite its lame Phil Glass redundavox). I have to love an album whose opener breaks with sincethe60s tradition and \"recognizes the authority of the clouds before the sun.\" Now that the fashionfucks have claimed rock and roll, you almost have to wander this far out to lose your shit.
