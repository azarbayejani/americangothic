{"label":" Definitive Jux","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/8642/homepage_large.1e53f206.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tom Breihan","artist":"C-Rayz Walz","title":"Year of the Beast","text":" According to his press kit, CRayz Walz burned his rhyme books before starting work on Year of the Beast, his sophomore album. This may have been a rash decision. It's difficult to say what may have been in those books, but it can't be much worse than the confused tangle of inarticulate introspection, halfbaked bravado, and antimainstream harangues that make up the bulk of the album. CRayz is one of the thousands of indierappers who routinely confuse \"expressionistic depth\" with \"not saying anything at all\"; there must be a better way to convey postmillennial paranoia than a line like \"Inside the pain, my thoughts was in shambles/ My brain, like eggs, became scrambled.\" And he uses the godawful \"holding my dic [pause] tionary\" pun in two separate songs. Walz came up as a battle rapper, but here he mostly goes on vague philosophical tangents. And when he does lash out, his disses often come across toothless (\"You're a clown; you wanna be down and sound gritty/ Your life was inspired by New Jack City\"). It doesn't help that his voice is mixed ridiculously high, so it never gets a chance to settle into the mix. And most of these beats are boring noodley scifi indierap joints with no bounce or flow. The best Def Jux albums (The Cold Vein, I Phantom) are fully realized, unified works, but the tracks on Year of the Beast don't have a damn thing to do with one another. There's no sweep or vision, and so Walz's worst flaws are left exposed: his tendency to lose the beat, his obnoxious habit of multitracking his own voice, the lack of force or immediacy in his jumpy, splenetic delivery. It's a shame, since there's a much better album fighting to get out of Year of the Beast. On tracks like ElP's buzzing, broken apocalyptic banger \"Paradise\" and the heavy, burbling oldschool dancehall throwback \"Pink\", Walz adjusts to the beat rather than forcing it to adjust to him. And Walz occasionally shows flashes of trenchant insight and eloquence. On the claustrophobic guitarbased stomper \"Blackout\", Walz is actually funny when he negotiates racial envy and confusion: \"I'ma be the shit at the meeting, statistically speaking.\" If Walz had brought those strengths to the rest of the album, he might've had something. Maybe next time he should keep the Bic away from the rhyme books. "}
