{"label":" DBK Works","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/415/homepage_large.092c3a72.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Andy Beta","artist":"Absolute Grey","title":"Greenhouse: 20th Anniversary Edition","text":" Funny that, so far, only the most stereotyped aspects of 80s music (Plasticine posing, early betaphase FX) have been obsessed over, while the pluggedin, underground janglepop of the early 80s remains obfuscated like the mossy gray overgrowth on the cover of Murmur. Fortunately, recent weeks have seen reissues of albums by the Mitch Easterfronted janglepop band Let's Active, and now, Rochesterbased Absolute Grey. Largely forgotten upstate save for a handful of fliers, an entry in Trouser Press, and generous remembrances by band peer Peter Buck, Bangs biographer Jim DeRogatis and former Forced Exposure scribe Byron Coley Absolute Grey's last LPs only saw daylight in Greece. Now, hoping to set matters straight, DBK has given their debut the remastered treatment. Beth Brown's melodic yearning on \"Saving Face\" hints at an alternate universe in which R.E.M. was femmefronted, though its Rickenbacker jangle is more receptive than Buck's and its rhythm not quite so wooden as it breathes and spirals through longer sixminute pop structures. On \"More Walnuts\", a feeling of teen love resounds with a solid, slightly psychoactive backbeat, the new world's apologetic \"So. Central Rain\". Other tunes like \"Sidewalk\" and \"Remorse\" sport the spartan instrument flange that echoes other paisley poppers of their day, not to mention the tint (and bangs) of Echo & The Bunnymen. Bolstering these studio babysteps, this new edition of Greenhouse is augmented by a live version of their \"Memory of You\" and an undergroundobligatory cover of the Velvets' \"I'm Beginning to See the Light\". Both show the peppy exuberance and limber interplay between drummer Patrick Thomas and bassist Mitch Rasor, giving Brown's voice plenty of room to soar. The album is also accompanied by a live disc whose title, Bless Their Pointed Little Heads: Live at Scorgie's bares the group's adoration of circa'67 Jefferson Airplane (it should not be bemused as expansion upon their earlier live album, A Journey Through the Past, which evokes Neil Young). It shows the band indulging in a more psychedelic space, leaning towards early Fillmore West music expansion within pop structures, while similarly maintaining diligence in the face of extended jamming proclivities. The \"poetry\" cringes at moments, though, and Brown's outofnowhere screech of \"We hate ice cream... the mouse ran up the clock!\" breaks the otherwise hypnotic and harrowing mood of \"Two Years a Handshake\". Only four songs from Greenhouse are documented live; the recording instead chooses to showcase the band's songwriting range, which not only rocks out with \"Getting Me Down\" and \"Candy Canes\", but also includes The Dream Syndicate's \"Tell Me When It's Over\". Before they shoot through \"Willow\" (complete with a brief, quicksilver soaring inside its instrumental break), Absolute Grey use their brief time onstage to breathlessly insist that the audience go see Invisible Party, Pat Casket, and Personal Effects open for Alex Chilton, still relatively unknown himself. For a second, it sounds as if they were already aware of the impermanent aspect of underground pop and the giddiness of its unimportant importance. "}
