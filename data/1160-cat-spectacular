Legos snap into place. Flutes poke, trumpets parry, and evil robots chortle as if Bearsuits' name was Yoshimi. Somewhere in an everexpanding universe of guitar, synths, and stuff your shortlived badkid playground friend probably pickpocketed from 7/11, the guileless boygirl vocals of Iain Ross and Lisa Horton chase highfructose melodies that start, stop, and change directions in midair like a butterfly or a hovercraft. Or: In what's shaping up to be a solid 12 months for arty indiepop and schizophrenic noisepop alike, English sextet Bearsuit lend the inspired innocence of the former to the joyous chaos of the latter. The gentle, melodic \"Cherryade\", with clipclop percussion and May morning harmonies, could be The Boy Least Likely To or a more sonically adventurous Camera Obscura. \"Going Steady\" goes anything but, the frenzied energy of \"Popscene\"era Blur made weirder with herkyjerky changes and this year's nominee for Best IndiePop Comeback Instrument, the recorder. \"Cookie Oh Jesus\" and \"Itsuko Got Married\" go off to the races with rapidfire handclaps and the whirligig aesthetic of peers like Bunky, or Deerhoof, or the Go! Team, or Architecture in Helsinki. Or: \"Why are the machines so sad?\" wonders Ross on the wistful, (post?) apocalyptic finale, \"On Your Special Day\". Shit, why indeed? It can't be cinematic opener \"Welcome to Bearsuit Hotel\", an instrumental unless you count Japanese spokenword snippets! It's definitely not due to \"Rodent Disco\", 2:08 of fuzz, sirens, strobe lights, a (deaf?) dumb and blind kid, cheerleader chants (\"disco!\"), and all of the sudden the tape stopping then starting then a final 20 seconds of chintzy fucking Casio. Is it the infectious (ha!) Plagueprompted chorus of \"Prove Katie Wrong\"? Maybe it's tinkly nonconformist ode \"Diagonal Girl\" (\"don't get too straight\") or impatient shortsongwithlongname \"I Feel the Heat of the Light From Heaven\". Or: Former John Peel favorites Bearsuit don't know a good thing when they see it, but they know not knowing is a better thing or another thing, anyway and that's all I know, except that once you open the can a fake snake jumps out (it's called love!) and everyone laughs but you can't close it. A fine spectacle, indeed. "}
