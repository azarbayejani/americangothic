{"label":" Hardly Art","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15252/homepage_large.45fcf03c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By David Raposa","artist":"Unnatural Helpers","title":"Cracked Love & Other Drugs","text":" Unnatural Helpers like to keep things short and tothepoint, so let me try and do the same. Cracked Love & Other Drugs is the second fulllength for these folks, the first with Sub Pop imprint Hardly Art. Dean Whitmore (who also played drums for the Intelligence) is the brains and the beat behind this operation, as well as being the group's only constant. Unnatural Helpers membership is fluid, taking whomever it can from other Seattlearea groups to fill out its ranks. They like to play garage rock, though some might call it punk rock. At any rate, the music of Unnatural Helpers definitely rocks, and it does so with efficiency the 15 tracks that comprise Cracked say their peace in only 25 minutes.Being from the Pacific Northwest, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Unnatural Helpers' music recalls likeminded Seattle groups past and present. Of course, any group banging out tunes like these folks do (regardless of geography) are liable to earn themselves illfitting comparisons to Nuggets stalwarts the Sonics, though the Helpers do bring to mind that group's dirty R&B swagger at times. They can also approximate the Wipers' riproaring guitar sound (see \"Brave Dumb Face\"), as well as AFrames' brittle brutality (on \"Vox Humana\"). And with Kurt Bloch recording the album, it'd be remiss to not mention the powerful punkpop of the Fastbacks. But while Cracked Love brings hooks aplenty hell, \"Useful Things\" is all hook having Whitmore's gruff and grimy voice out in front doesn't really bring the sweetness the way Kim Warnick did for Bloch's bunch.If there is a vocalist Whitmore's taking his cues from, it's without a doubt Mudhoney's Mark Arm. The words to these songs beg to be sung with the same smirk and bemused disgust that Arm perfected \"My looks are killing me/ But I'm never gonna give it up\" and Whitmore doesn't disappoint. Whether he's making like the world's most jaded wallflower (in the lyric quoted previously, from \"Sunshine / Pretty Girls\"), claiming he didn't know \"She Was Your Girlfriend\" (\"It would take a real cool sleuth to blow her  cover\"), or displaying an abnormal amount of pride in taking his licks in \"Claim It Mine\", Whitmore comes off like the coolest loser in the room. Cracked Love might sound too clean and sharp to comfortably fit in with their modernday hotshit garagey counterparts like Thee Oh Sees or Times New Viking (\"blame\" Bloch's unfussy production for that blessing), but when it comes to talking about who's got the goods in this particular arena, this album shows that Unnatural Helpers deserve to be part of that conversation.
