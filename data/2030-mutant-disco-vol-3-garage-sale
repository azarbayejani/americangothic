{"label":" ZE","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/2014/homepage_large.78adecf3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Cameron Macdonald","artist":"Various Artists","title":"Mutant Disco, Vol. 3: Garage Sale","text":" Peter Shapiro provided more questions than answers when he attempted to explain the genre tag \"mutant disco\" in the February 2003 issue of The Wire. His piece detailed how during the 70s and early 80s, assorted misfits, art students, and punks concocted an alien disco music, yet his umbrella did not quite shade his honorable mentions, which were as scattered as Smokey Robinson, Public Image Ltd., Material, and James White and the Blacks. There is an argument that a scientific theory is meaningless if it cannot be explained to a 10yearold. As for \"mutant disco,\" well...let's just consider it disco or a trace of disco that is more likely to halt the dancefloor than continue narcotizing it. The recently resurrected ZE label first cut its teeth releasing examples of \"mutant disco\" on its 1981 comp of the same name. Perhaps because of Shapiro's piece, ZE reissued and doubled the size of Mutant Disco: A Subtle Discolation of the Norm in 2003. Now the label issues Volume 3: Garage Sale, a supposed shoebox of Reaganera snapshots from when disco evolved into \"garage\" or the beginnings of house music on the turntables of DJ Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York. While ZE's connection with mutant disco and house is rather forced, I just have to ask this question: Where has Junie Morrison been all my life? He planted one of the most vivid images in my mind with his 1983 electrofunk tune sold in the Garage Sale, \"TechnoFreqs\". The Funkadelic vet seemingly hosts a lunchtime performance for a teen sciencefair; pondering video game addiction with a broken tapeloop machine and a robot that parrots idiotbox catchphrases. \"Are we man or machine? We have to make the choice tonight/ (Insert the robot sidekick): 'I pity the fool who doesn't make the choice tonight!'/ Remember how to freak and everything will be alright,\" goes a few verses carefully crooned as to not upset each face in the front row. This is camp as a reason for living no matter how many friends, coworkers, and clergymen laugh at you. However, Don Armando's \"I'm an Indian, Too\" troubles me. His Broadwaydisco number, complete with a full orchestra backing, is up there with Cher's \"Half Breed\" the legacy of indigenous America bastardized into the Star's egotistical grace. But then again, one cannot take a song too seriously that demands choreography and a diva who tells you with a hand on hip, \"I am ChipoWA, IroQWA, OmoHA, like those Indians, well I'm an Indian too!\" You get the idea. Another curiosity is Daisy Chain's afterschool special rock, \"No Time to Stop Believing in Love\", which delivers raps in Spanish and Japanese to vaguely suicidal adolescents in assembly. Detroit's great Was (Not Was) delivers an oddly melancholic, openshirted, and jericurled disco number, \"Dance or Die\", and an idea that ceases to be clever after about five seconds, \"Read My Lips\" a Contempo Casuals house tune with Caesar I's wondrous promise, broken even after swearing on the King James version of the Bible. More faithful to the gospel and its blessings upon man is Suicide's \"Dream Baby Dream\", where frontman Alan Vega prays in tongues over wheatlands swaying in keyboardist Martin Rev's organs. Vega fares worse in August \"Kid Creole\" Darnell's remix of \"Outlaw\", a rockabilly jaunt that goes nowhere. Larry Levan's fingerprints on Kid Creole & the Coconuts' \"Something Wrong in Paradise\" are stronger, exploding a Latinfunk block party into a million colors. Most of Garage Sale seems to be novelties more than anything else. While that essence is the comp's selling point, it could unfortunately lead many to believe that mutant disco itself is nothing more. "}
