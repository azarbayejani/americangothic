{"label":" Rough Trade","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/2894/homepage_large.bce0d993.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Adam Moerder","artist":"Eastern Lane","title":"The Article","text":" Somehow the word \"drunken\" has become a positive modifier for a rock band. Blame it on garage rock revivalists like the Vines or Kings of Leon who've garbled and staggered their way to fame, or music magazines overly eager to publish which drugs Jet or exLibertines members take, but one thing's for sure sounding wasted is mod. Take The Article's opener \"Daffodils For My Mother\": While someone literally starts eating a daffodil for money, singer Derek Meins giggles idiotically at his own jokes: \"Are daffodils edible?...Does your daffodil taste good? Two bass drums if your daffodil tastes good!\" Then, as instructed, two beats cue the stomping 60second ToadiesviaPixies ripoff. Maybe Meins is merely compensating for Eastern Lane's hohum BerwickuponTweed roots, but his contrived recklessness isn't working. If you're going to tug at heartstrings on the mushy piano ballad \"I Feel Liberated\", don't expect to pass for Johnny Rotten and not give a fuck on single \"I Said Pig on Friday\", which contains the album's most unapologetically gauche lyrics: \"Love is a glove that does not fit/ The pussy, the folly, the tit.\" Come on, how do you not then snicker when the band puts their gear away on \"Goodbye Rose Garden\" and Meins grabs an acoustic to whisper \"I'll be waitin' till the big hand meets the small one/ And I'll be longing on my own/ I'll be waiting 'til the morning brings me 'round.\" Between these two extremes, Meins employs an overthetop bluespunk wail, often clashing with the band's sober, comprehensive playing. In this case \"comprehensive\" means mixing postpunk with anything from Gin Blossoms riffing to Foo Fighters powerpop. The best result of this fusion is \"No. 5\", which grinds on a pretty seven chord before smoothing out into a sunny, delicate chorus where shhh! Meins finally sings with his \"inside voice.\" \"For the Sun\" falls a little short of these expectations, but Meins' fieriness buoys the song despite its singalong chorus and radiofriendly veneer. Saying Eastern Lane have an identity crisis would be misleading; these guys simply don't know how intoxicated they actually are. What the band assumes is ballsout intensity on The Article is instead a selfconscious impulse to offset innocuous songwriting. You all know the type: The guy at the party wearing a lampshade on his head, screaming drunken obscenities, and chugging Tabasco sauce only to be found 30 minutes later serenading girls with his acoustic and some DMB.
