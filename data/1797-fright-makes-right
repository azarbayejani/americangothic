Prenatalism is the new futurism (which is also the old postnatalism): drummers yearn for their first belly kick, vox chicks their primal scream. A cough's a far cry from a scream heyo but like Schjeldahl said in praise of Twombly, this Chicago sixpiece had to work pretty damn hard to sound so effectively purposeless, so magically prehumanstinctual. 'Nother words: baby Swans. Coughs are loud and droney and noisebursty and the female lead singer sounds like Kim Deal (obviously). But unlike a lot of these amniotic noiseisthenextfrontier ballsacs Coughs stay in the crib, drooling over their own toddler rhymes and popping off the milky noise teat we call time signatures, somehow never giving up the charade (except once, I'll get to it, something about a banjo). Even the alphabetical song ordering smells like Gerber baby: as if Coughs just greened out the tracks and Ma Load had to sequence them, aka the noise label diaper wipe. I know I'm making everything this band does sound so dreadfully important. Truth is most songs on Fright Makes Right are not hardpassed shits but gratuitous giggles. String out a Zulu Nation break and tap that Lord of the Flies beast called men's predisposition to backyard evil (\"I killed a snake today!\" shout Coughs) that song's called \"Garter Snake\". \"Give Peace a Chance\" goes \"Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!\"; \"Mail Order\" goes \"Stay in your house/ Never come out!\"; \"Starchitect\" goes \"Frank Lloyd Wright! You're all right! I.M. Pei! You're OK!\" (Pei is \"pay,\" not \"pee\" didyaknow?). My favorite of this sort is Coughs' sametitled homage to Schoolhouse Rock's \"I'm Just a Bill\": The bill's vicious taunt, \"We're the architects of society!\" plays on the album title all too well if Bob Dorough had been covered by Josef Mengele. There's a saxophone, too. With such a fine line between virtuosity and complete horseshit (yes you, Coltrane), over time the instrument has rightfully secured a spot as incomprehensibility's choice musical avatar. Firstlesson squawks and thirdlesson flourishes stripe the disc, but Coughs totally tow the line on \"Elephant\" with its reedy wholenote slams, East London cocked back guitar needling, and Ashlee prestudio vocal and \"Narwahl\", a pleasant Sonic Youth rip. But let's talk about this banjo track. It's called \"Come Back to Me\", and like any banjo track it's simultaneously the best and worst track on the album. Best, because it's meant to be the best here Coughs freakfolk and sungtong counterpoint to the delight of us kids who didn't even know about Brian Wilson until last year. Worst though, because, as Glenn McDonald felt about \"One With the Freaks\" on the Notwist's Neon Golden, the song becomes Fright Makes Right's reverse blackhole, a pop gem that robs Coughs of their rub, the howto magic show that betrays their sleights of hand. Coughs, cough, get in my belly. "}
