Gunplay\" on Deeper Than Rap. On that album, otherwise a strictly Alist banquet of superstar entitlement, Gunplay was the only noname, and he tore into the opportunity, spitting a ferocious, rubberylipped verse. Of all the album's marqueestar guests Nas, Wayne, Kanye, NeYo Gunplay took the best temperature of the environment, delivering exuberant ridiculousness on par with his boss. In case we were tempted to dismiss this appearance as a fluke or oneoff, Gunplay has returned with this mixtape, which should clarify matters. It is named Inglorious Bastard (The Prelude to Valkyrie), which in another era could have been a Queensrÿche album title. It has the above cover art, which sort of speaks for itself. The production consists entirely of postLex Luger monstercrunk beats. Waka Flocka Flame is prominently featured on the first full song. There is a song called \"4 Loko\" in which Gunplay raps over the beat to \"Hard in Da Paint\". In pretty much every way possible, in other words, Inglorious Bastard is a straight flush of transcendent dumbassery. Part of the loony joy of Inglorious Bastard comes from how ably Gunplay springs off of his boss: He plays wildeyed foil to Ricky's furdraped crime kingpin, but since Ross is not exactly rap's most sober, grounded figure to begin with, things get giddy pretty quickly. Ross is all over the tape, too, running his bellowing \"B.M.F.\" cadence down into the tire treads, and while Ross is always welcome, Gunplay doesn't need him: he's endlessly entertaining all on his own. On a freestyle over Drake's \"Miss Me\", he claims he's \"ugly in real life, handsome on a flat screen\" and later says he's \"Skypin' with ya wifey/ Thank god for electronics.\" On \"Bust Your Heart\", he screams, \"No Arm and Hammer in my Hannah Montana/ These kicks ain't alligator skin, I think they salamander!\" On \"Pump That Fee Up\", he calls someone \"more pussy than a cat paw.\" The sneaky cleverness of some of these lines point to Gunplay's dirty, shameful secret: He's actually a pretty great rapper. It's not immediately detectable beneath his goofy bluster, but in the buried internal rhymes and piledup assonances of lines like \"My niggas rock rags like a Saudi/ My Maserati looping round the emblems on ya Audi/ Only nigga out in Berlin blowin' Cali Maui/ Only nigga out in Paree spittin' out my calamaris\" (from \"Another One\", a steamrolling collaboration with Rick Ross and Diddy) you can hear the crumpled sheets of draft paper that went into them, as well as a genuine love of words. This sense of craftsmanship is part of why Inglorious Bastard remains replayable after dozens of listens, but it also means things never catch fire in the same way Flockaveli did. At every moment, Gunplay remains firmly in control of his own unhinged joyride, whereas it wasn't entirely clear if Flockaveli came equipped with brakes. Gunplay doesn't quite fit in with this new school of goon rappers, in that way his blend of deadserious technical chops and exaggerated classclown posing harks back to Redman, an older model, and rap fans who couldn't stomach the artlessness of Waka Flocka's lyrics might find a more companionable listen in Bastard. However you take it, though, Inglorious remains some of the most colorful and invigorating rap of 2011. If you have a treadmill run in your future, or a car you need to destroy with your bare hands, it should make a suitable accompaniment to either activity. "}
