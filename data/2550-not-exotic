Deusner","artist":"Dolorean","title":"Not Exotic","text":" That's not Dolorean as in the disgraced 80s automotive tycoon or his Back to the Future car, but Dolorean as in pain. Which, all pretensions aside, is a pretty apt descriptor for this Oregon band's debut fulllength, Not Exotic. Their atmospheric indie folk plumbs the depths of everyday despair in nine tracks whose narratives and narrators suggest a shortstory collection set to music. These songs are heavy on lyrics, but light on instrumentation: only a little livelier than Low and neither as exotic as Pinetop Seven nor as tranced out as Bedhead. Usually, the songs feature just an acoustic guitar, shuffling drums, and a quiet piano accompanying Al James' plaintive vocals, but when the band's feeling crazy, they throw in synths or a quietly burbling organ. Almost as a consequence, the songs have an unhurried slacker's pace, a walking tempo. \"Morningwatch\" sets the tone early, as James identifies himself with \"those of us who cannot sleep/ Just because of things we've done.\" The songs that follow depict acts of physical or emotional violence, ineluctable catastrophes that create crippling regrets in his characters. There's the adulterer in \"Traded for Fire\" who runs from his sins, praying, \"Don't let me settle down in a small northern town to die.\" A woman withholds a dark secret from her lover in \"Still Here with Me\", although it takes it toll: \"And you kiss like a corpse,\" James sings, \"and you smile like a crow.\" On the blandly Gothic murder ballad \"Hannibal, MO\", a smalltown mechanic confesses to killing his collegebound true love. Fortunately, James has the good sense to imply the narrator's regrets instead of stating them directly: \"Her father says he'll shoot me down if I don't do it myself.\" A poet before he founded Dolorean, James traffics in a selfconscious brand of indie verse, full of gentle pretensions and casually evocative imagery. For example, in the town of Hannibal, Missouri, \"where the Mississippi turns flat and wide/ We'd lay out on the sandbars and fall asleep to the barges and the fireflies.\" Both his writerly and his physical voice meld together nicely, coasting on the last word in each phrase and drawing it out lazily to something halfway between a conspiratorial whisper and a resigned sigh. For every justright line, though, there's another in which James' lyrical approach is either too much or not quite enough. The rest of \"Hannibal, MO\" is so conversational in tone that it sounds clunky: \"Summer was ending and she was leaving soon to study writing on the East Coast.\" Even set to the rueful melody, this line jambs against the others, and despite the nearness of betrayal and death, the song never breaks its patient tone, its unexcitability undercutting rather than conveying its deep regret. On the other hand, the jaded \"So You're a Touring Band Now\" contains a pointed commentary on the life of a musician: \"My friends are knives that cut out my tongue/ No songs and no beats no words left to speak, just utters and grunts,\" he sings. \"Drive 10,000 miles just to tear off your arm just to play the guitar and recite a poem.\" The sentiment that the life of a smalltime indie rocker can quickly corrode your selfworth sounds achingly autobiographical, but James overstates it almost to the point of abstraction. As its title suggests, Not Exotic has a modest goal: to spare no pain as it ferries listeners from one morningwatch to the next, with as little fuss as possible. Perhaps a little more fuss would have made the journey more memorable. "}
