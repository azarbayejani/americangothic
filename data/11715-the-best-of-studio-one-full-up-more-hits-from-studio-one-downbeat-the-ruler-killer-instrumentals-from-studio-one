From his days running one of Kingston's most successful sound systems through the founding of the Studio One label and studio to his relocation to New York in the mid1980s, Dodd was at or near the forefront of Jamaican music, weathering and helping shape each new trend. Nearly every major name in the island's music scene recorded for him at least once, and such luminaries as Prince Buster, Lee Perry, Dennis Brown, and Peter Tosh (Bob Marley came to Dodd with Tosh & the Wailers after recording just four tracks for Leslie Kong) began their careers working with or for him.Dodd was also one of the original innovators of the signature Jamaican offbeat rhythm. His production of Theophilus Beckford's instrumental \"Easy Snappin'\" is, along with early productions by Edward Seaga and Prince Buster, among the first recordings to hint at the transformation of straightahead Jamaican r&b; into ska. Naturally, over the course of three decades, Dodd compiled an imposing back catalog, and approaching it as a newcomer to reggae is daunting, to put it mildly. Given that a collection of \"the best of Studio One\" could easily be a 12disc box set, it stands to reason that the folks at Heartbeat didn't have much trouble finding 32 killer tracks to spread across The Best of Studio One (this release is a remastered and expanded version of a 1985 compilation with informative, if somewhat partisan, liner notes) and its companion volume, Full Up.Both volumes are excellent and serve nicely as a starting point to Studio One, but they're also likely to appeal to people who've already done a little exploring, as each includes a mixture of big and small names. Bringing together material spanning from rocksteady to the early dancehall years, these discs aren't exactly focused, but even as styles shifted and the studio setup expanded, the Studio One sound remained pretty consistent, with simple, inthepocket drumming, phenomenal basslines, great horn arrangements, and plenty of amazing vocal harmonies.The Best of Studio One features three of Jamaica's greatest soul vocalists, John Holt, Alton Ellis, and Ken Boothe, each in superb form. Ellis's \"Can I Change My Mind\" skanks so easy it feels weightless, and Boothe's \"Just Another Girl\" features some backing harmonies for his supple voice to play off. A handful of great rocksteady harmony groups present reggae's sweet side, lead by the Heptones' drifting threepart vocal arrangement on \"Party Time\". Slim Smith's \"Born to Love\" sound like the Impressions in Jamaica, while the Lyrics, later to become famous for the Marcus Garvey tribute \"Black Star Liner\", sound deceptively sugary on the obliquely topical \"Music Like Dirt\". Dancehall star Johnny Osborne's honey voice mingles beautifully with roots harmonies on the transcendent \"Jah Promise\", one of several pointedly Rastafarian songs. The Rasta angle is taken further by the Abyssinians, who get overtly political on 1969's \"Declaration of Rights\", singing \"Get up and fight for your rights, my brothers/ Get up and fight for your rights, my sisters\" in something of a warmup for the following year's epochal \"Satta Massa Gana\", one of reggae's defining militant tracks.Full Up features a similar balance of the sweet and the heavy, opening with the lilting rocksteady of \"Love Me Forever\", by Carlton & the Shoes and sprinkling soul tracks like Bob Evans and the Paragons' hornfueled \"Danger in Your Eyes\" and the Royals' harmonysoaked \"Pick Up the Pieces\" around Babylon callouts from roots icons Burning Spear and Culture. Culture's \"Behold the Land\" is a particularly stunning affirmation of black pride set against the history of slavery. Willie Williams tackles modern iniquity on \"Armagideon Time\", singing \"A lot of people won't get no justice tonight/ So a lot of people going to have to stand up and fight\" over the Sound Dimension's classic \"Real Rock\" riddim.Which brings us to a third Studio One release: Downbeat the Ruler collects instrumentals from the late 60s and early 70s, focusing primarily on the rocksteady era, when the Sound Dimension (originally known as the Soul Vendors) ruled as Studio One's house band. Featuring exSkatalites Tommy McCook and Jackie Mittoo, the Sound Dimension backed dozens of singers on a slew of hits in the late 60s, but they made just as great an impact with their instrumentals, most of which have been versioned and copied many times over.The Sound Dimension's importance to the sound of Studio One from 1967 onward is evidenced by the fact that seven of the 18 tracks on the disc are theirs, with an additional three from the Soul Vendors, and solo tracks from Tommy McCook and Jackie Mittoo. Mittoo's \"Freak Out\" is a deep groover, grounded by his subtle Hammond organ and a massive bassline, with a great, easyflowing horn arrangement on top. The Sound Dimension's \"Real Rock\" is a defining track for its stabbing organ hook, immense groove, and drawnout trombone melody. Dub Specialist's \"Banana Walk\" and the Soul Vendors' 10minute \"Death in the Arena\" showcase Studio One's early embrace of dub, though Dodd's dub output was always overshadowed by that of Lee Perry, Augustus Pablo, and King Tubby.These three discs offer a look at just a tiny slice of the incredible body of work Dodd oversaw during his lifetime, but it's a good slice, below the radar for most Americans but not so obscure or arcane that newcomers will have trouble getting behind the offbeat. I'd recommend The Best of Studio One and Full Up solid introductions to Dodd's inestimable legend to just about anybody, while Downbeat the Ruler is a better bet for those already committed to exploring Jamaican music in its various guises.
