The young ones sure do grow up fast these days. Just last spring I helped a band grow from toddlerhood to adolescence. To put it mildly, Where's Wolfie, Wolfie's sophomore LP, didn't really satisfy me. Yet, those who heard their debut couldn't really call it a \"slump.\" Naturally, Mike Downey (as in \"softener\") emailed me voicing his objections. See, he plays guitar/bass and sings in Wolfie. Turns out he disagreed with my opinion! Mike went on to make other brilliant observations like, \"All music is good,\" \"If you don't like an album, don't review it,\" and \"I'm not a music critic, nor will I ever be, since it's the most pretentious profession.\" Just above rockstar, then? Then a strange thing happened. Wolfie realized I was right! On their website, and now in the press kit for their new EP, Wolfie and the Coat and Hat, the band proclaims, \"We made an album that none of us were happy with from day one of its release.\" Funny, Mike really seemed to be behind it at the time. \"We had made an album none of us could listen to,\" Wolfie confess. Certainly speaks a lot for the fans they sold it to. My primary criticism with Where's Wolfie laid in the heavy reliance on three chords, moog stabs and \"lalalas.\" Soon afterward, Wolfie coincidentally \"realized we could do better than a few power chords, a cheesy synth keyboard, and some 'la la las.'\\x94 Well then, the big question is: can they? The answer: a resounding \"Eh...\" (4.9). \"They Call Me Leaves\" opens the EP with fuzzedout bass that dominates the mix. Amanda, Joe and Mike pass off harmonies like relay batons. The song skips along with urgency, barely allowing enough time for synchronized fistpumping, rushing over hilly choruses before splashing down with a gasp Big Rock Solo into a dainty acoustic coda. The song sticks agreeably like chocolate ticks. Still, shouldn't bands set the high jump bar a little higher than the Rentals' Seven More Minutes? The big light bulb that appeared over Wolfie's collective head flickered Morse code inspiration to the awed rockers. It thus spoke in glows (being collegiate Mathletes, Wolfie easily comprehend Morse code): \"Wolfie, put two little songs together to make one bigger song and this will be complex songwriting.\" Thus, by the second track, \"It's Hard Luck Being Me,\" tempered chugging breaks into a perky fournote blues progression. (Please keep in mind that this is a guitar classification and not any indication of real \"blues.\") \"The All Good People\\x94 similarly shifts gears midway. Far from being prog, this short attention span style at least keeps listeners on their toes. Unfortunately, it also gets in the way of any real songwriting development. Still, this is pop at its gummiest. One shouldn't expect the craft of Canada's Greatest, Leonard Cohen. So, yes, some progressions are made from the last album. Guitars punch more than scratch (and tickle). Harmonies assist choruses instead of randomly babaing for babaing's sake. But Wolfie and the Coat and Hat takes baby steps for a band that disowned their last album. Grindcore or krautrock would be a real conversion. Perhaps I didn't make myself clear enough last time. Not only is there more to pop than three chords, moog stabs and \"lalalas,\" but additionally, there's more to pop than thin organ ooze, a few open chords, and some \"Ahhahahaaaaahs\" and/or \"Whooooooos.\" Okay, sometimes there's not, but that sometimes was back in 1962. Lyrically, Wolfie could use another Morse codespeaking giant light bulb. But until one comes along, let me make some final recommendations. I just want to help. I know you're listening. 1)\\tLet Amanda sing more. Or at least have Joe and Mike see someone about that sinus problem. Claritin, perhaps? 2)\\tThe instruments seem punched into a computer. Depth and warmth should slake the production. The translucent organ wavers like a whistle. Picture pipe organs bursting from church balconies. Open rooms and multiple tracks exist to be filled. Don't worry about replicating this live. Build, build, build. Tone, tone, tone. 3)\\tStop singing about birds and flowers and trees and leaves and groves and hats and coats and...
