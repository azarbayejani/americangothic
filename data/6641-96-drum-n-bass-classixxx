Does Dillinja have what it takes to dethrone the samurai math beatster as the ruler of \"Ninja Gaiden\"? And if they all broke out the Sega Master System while fiddling with their laptops, just what the hell would it sound like? Why, it would most likely sound like '96 Drum N Bass Classixxx, you silly thing. Or at least, that's the scenario Raczynski has in mind, judging from this twelvetrack assault of freakedout, 8bit, PolishcumJapanese ripups. Though described on his website as a collection of oldskool underground d'n'b rollers mixed by \"DJ Bogdan Raczynski\", what we really have here are twelve alter egos burying their teeth into said genre, mashing it between molars and bicuspids and spitting it all over the dance floor. It's a lovenote from Raczynski to the likes of Omni Trio and the Metalheadz Krew, a fusing of the former's adrenalized drillnbass bounce with the latter's pioneering sound(s). After a brief digression into the wispy, acoustic/electronic music sound so popular with critics five seconds ago, Raczynski has returned to the fertile stomping grounds of his more beatheavy material, ranging from the ballistic assshaking of Thinking of You's \"Unsatisfied Customer\" to preRephlex mashers like \"30002389\" caffeinated breaks and improbably deep bass tones that would send the balls of any raver right up into the secret pocket of their scratchnsniff UFOs. \"Battle Zone 1996\" alone is worth the price of admission to the party, its dark cutups and mighty bassline delivering on its promise to \"put the girls in heat\". Believe me, when that first bass tone rattles the window frame, there's gonna be a flood. Elsewhere, Raczynski drops a bomb under the guise of Agent 30 with \"5L45H! 4TT4CK! 3NT3R K3Y\", which pits a fuzzedout, descending arpeggio against bumrushing snare rolls before breaking into music from some lost level of \"Mega Man\". And \"D&D; Diabolical\" covers similar territory, rocking some raga breaks and bringing back the philosophizing narrator from his first album, Boku Mo Warakan.Classixxx is far from the serious affair that was 2000's My Love I Love, allowing Raczynski to hang loose and break new ground in a genre time forgot. Witness the liquid flow of \"Governor's Banquet\", the ease with which Amen breaks slide into mad drillnbass tempos before returning to their original, blunted course. This stuff is far too insane for your average jungle fan, to be sure any who dared to take a ride on a merrygoround like \"Pouch Fulla Seed (Hard on You RMX)\" would find their ass facedown on the playground asphalt in seconds. But those into the scarier aspects of electronic weirdness, who like their music abstract with rampant unpredictability and personality, will be indiscriminately beat down by Bogdan's badassery. \"Shinobi\"? Shit, this is smallcircle jujitsu. "}
