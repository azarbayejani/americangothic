His civil service is noble; too many greats were shoved to the side in many textbooks and \"hip, urban tastemaker\" namedrops that typically praise the graces of Cage, Stockhausen, Russolo, etc. Hinant was also guilty of sacrificing a few goats to these deities in his first Anthology. However, Hinant took his second volume into greener hinterlands. He featured the likes of BBC sound designer Daphne Oram and David Lynch collaborator/Eraserhead soundtrack mastermind Alan R. Splet, and he ended this set of noise and electronic music with a Captain Beefheart spokenword performance. Hinant actually apologizes for the shortcomings of his third volume, which focuses on Germany's electronica heritage. His survey introduces a few laudable drone and musique concrete artists, but gives little sense about the German electronic aesthetic. The faces of Kraftwerk, Oval, Mouse on Mars, and even Der Pate Stockhausen are missing. The great krautrock legacy is reduced to Neu's Michael Rother drifting to sleep on the Autobahn with Jaki Liebezeit playing with his seatbelt in \"Feuerland\", and a tiny excerpt of The Faust Tapes that shall fly over heads. German posttechno doesn't get much justice either: Carsten Nicolai's \"time...dot (3)\" will remind one of the \"clicks and cuts\" backlash, and Peter \"Pita\" Rehberg donates a decent but monotonous recording of a chugging engine he recorded when 16. For the nonGermanic material, Hinant offers an often enticing survey of alien and hallucinatory soundscapes. Japanese warlord Merzbow will singe memories with \"Birds and Warhorse\". Masami Akita first discomforts with peaceful birdsongs heard through a hazy cell phone causing me to flinch as I anticipated a thermonuclear blast of feedback at any moment. And, by gar, the bastid delivers. The birds wail like mistaken SARS carriers on their way to a government biohazard disposal the monolithic distortion and digital hardcore beats drive the death march. Michel Chion also bites the neck with \"Requiem: Dies Irae\", a ballet of bathtub operas, whispered group chants, and theatrical death threats. Another fine mutation is Bernard Parmegiani's \"De Natura Sonorum: Matieres induites\". He first sandpapers synapses with microtonal brine that bleeds into rainfall with tossed trash cans and guitar pings following suit. Other bafflers include a warehouse air fumigator that skitters and blows ashes in Justin Bennett's \"Ovipool\", Francisco Lopez's hyperreal document of insects muttering at overhead jetliners in \"Untitled #148\", and the liquefied crunch of stones in Scott Gibbons' \"Stone: Reciprocal\". The rest of Anthology dwells in kitchensink collages and white noise indulgence best left to termpaper footnotes. The closer, \"Eternal Love #3\" by Swedish minimalist techno unit Phauss, along with composer CM von Hausswolff and filmmaker Erik Pauser fails to seek transcendence with Geiger counter clicks and lawnmower guitar hums. Where's Beefheart when we need him? "}
