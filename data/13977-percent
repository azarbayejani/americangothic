{"label":" Kanine","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/15019/homepage_large.e2eb2c7e.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Dinowalrus","title":"%","text":" Maybe I'm assuming too much about \"indie fame in 2010,\" but there's a good chance listeners may stumble upon % because of Peter Feigenbaum's side gig as touring guitarist for Titus Andronicus. But while most of Titus' associates, whether it's Fucked Up, Spider Bags, or Vivian Girls, have some sort of relation to their beerandspittle soaked populist rage, Dinowalrus' influences are notable for their inaccessibility: Sonic Youth circa Bad Moon Rising, no wavers like Flipper and Glenn Branca.Yet that overstates %'s standoffishness judging from the songlength ambient break of \"I Hate Letters\" and the rafterreaching, reverbsoaked \"I Hate Numbers\", the album won't be too prickly for anyone who still listens to Deerhunter's Cryptograms in its intended sequence. But where that album's flow was crucial, Dinowalrus stays true to its name by smashing incompatible parts together into an intriguing, if occasionally nonsensical, sonic blend. So much of \"Electric Car, Gas Guitar\", for example could've been explored further, from the exposedwire synth shocks to the dublike reverb effects, to squawking saxophone. About the only thing that holds it together is an almost jokey baritone from Feigenbaum that barks lyrics like, \"A Chinese wall/ A toilet stall.\"Dinowalrus are too chaotic to have memorable structure, but not unpredictable enough to bring to mind improv. The Steve Reich nod \"Bead\" straightens its cycling synths into a sturdy fouronthefloor disco, but only for about a minute. Though this brief glance of coherence serves as one of %'s most exciting moments, shortly after it, Kyle Warren's vocals come off like a unholy midpoint between Comets on Fire's echoplexed wails and Lightning Bolt's megaphone cheerleading. It's enough to momentarily jar you out of a comfort zone, but like most of %'s abrasive effects, it doesn't quite burn hot enough to singe.There's an initially clever shift from warbly surf riffs to doubletime cowpunk on \"Cage Those Pythons\", and \"Nuke Duke 'Em\" has a title as badass as its stungun guitar runs, but these brief glances of songwriting congruence only occasionally lift this 10minute block from aimlessness. And ultimately, that puts a damper on what % could be. It's easy to gain the band's sense of sonic pranksterism, but from where does their passion derive? The Wirey fuzz workout \"I Hate Numbers\" has an arenasized chorus that provides a fresh wallop, but like most of the intelligible moments of %, it's more of a relief than anything else. \"Haze on the Mobius Strip\" tries for a similarly roomfilling sound (for me it brings to mind Smashing Pumpkins' \"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\") and eventually reaches a satisfyingly noisy climax, but the silo reverb lends too much distance for it to generate its intended impact. I'm sure it's all firecrackers live, and in their defense, Dinowalrus' populistnoise contemporaries (Liars, Oneida) needed periods of woodshedding to find their way. But I suppose it does the title justice when % finds a band that's not quite all there yet. "}
