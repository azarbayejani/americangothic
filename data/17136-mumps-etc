{"label":" Anticon / City Slang","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/18324/homepage_large.06210b79.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"WHY?","title":"Mumps, etc.","text":" The realization that a great band has made a terrible record marks the point of pivot where you stop thinking about what's happening as a listener and turn into something like a forensics expert asking, \"what happened?\" The best case scenario is that an outside pathogen is to blame, a failed genre experiment, an illfitting producer, drugs. These are the things cult classics and critical reclamation projects are made of. The inside jobs are far more painful to endure records such as Travis Morrison's Travistan, Weezer's Make Believe, the Smashing Pumpkins' MACHINA/The Machines of God and the Streets' The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living that clearly couldn't have been made by anyone but their creators, but where the same qualities responsible for such individual and affecting works of art have completely turned on their owners. Mumps, etc. is of the latter variety, an often unlistenable album from WHY?, a group whose music is often excellent. It might sound counterintuitive to claim that restraint would've worked to WHY?'s benefit here. A large part of the appeal of records like Alopecia and Eskimo Snow was that they let Yoni Wolf run rampant lyrically and emotionally, all while his band exploded the boundaries that would have kept them in either indie rock, hiphop, or even \"indie rap.\" No matter what Wolf was going on about masturbation, his bowel movements, any number of exgirlfriends his extremism was tethered by relatable emotions and strong hooks. Whether it was the result of taking an unusually long time off between records or not, Wolf has sunk even further into himself, but not to discover some sort of deeper truth about the human condition. Instead, a sizable portion of Mumps, etc. turns out to be a longform rumination on what it means to be Yoni Wolf, Lead Singer of WHY?. Doesn't matter if it's The Wall or from the perspective of a guy who admits, \"I make decent cash, I'm a minor star,\" as Wolf does on \"Sod in the Seed\"; the \"lot of the touring musician\" album has a great track record of establishing the frightening point when an artist feels entitled to a listener's empathy despite having their most distorted sense of self. Yet it's not unthinkable for Wolf to find pathos in this scenario, since at WHY?'s level of success, \"how can I keep this up?\" is more a crisis of relatable age and economic concerns rather than that of a poor lil' rich boy in a gilded cage. But it's nearly impossible to find Wolf's situation interesting because I'm not sure he thinks it is either.  He repeatedly references the end of his \"rap career\" as something of a given and bemoans its terrible mundanity \"I can't sleep in rental cars or airlines/ Yo, and so I keep the deck of cards for downtime.\" Either that, or he gets lost in impenetrable metaphor as a means of distracting from that mundanity. During the sickly mariachi lurch of \"White English\", Wolf engages in impressive verbal gymnastics in order to avoid saying what he actually means, and it's summed up by its diffident hook: \"Lost in translation.\" Same for \"Thirst\", which introduces potentially loaded metaphors about black cowboys and discarded pornstuffed G4 motherboards without delving far enough into their symbolism; when Wolf pleads, \"He will always thirst like that/ He will thirst like that always,\" it fails to register. He might thirst like that, but how the hell are we supposed to know what \"that\" means? But when really getting to the bottom of why Mumps, etc. often sounds like it wasn't subject to outside QC, it isn't so much about Wolf's lyrical inscrutability but rather that long stretches of the record are just really fucking hard to listen to. Musically, it's perfectly fine and a logical dovetailing of Alopecia's sharp hybrid of hiphop and indie rock with Eskimo Snow's forays into postrock and folk, if maybe sidling a little too close to the sort of Danger Mousestyle pophop it knows it can't be. And that's because Wolf has completely lost a grip on judging his own vocals. They've always been an acquired taste for sure, and on Alopecia and Eskimo Snow, Wolf showed a canny command of his various modes of monotone, staggered rapping, heartsick crooning that packed unorthodox pop smarts. As Wolf attempts a more perfect union of those various modes, he ends up with a hybrid that somehow manages to bring all of his most grating qualities to the fore, to the point where the actual words of a line like \"when I got better from the mumps, yes my swollen nut and neck shrunk\" are the least objectionable thing about it.   Combatively nasal, all jagged edges and botched notes, Wolf makes an irreversible, disheartening slide into Borscht Belt jokes about his advancing age (\"I'm in decline/ But women like be jockin' still/ 'Cause I rhyme with skill and talk so chill and youthful\"), retreating hairline (\"Girls used to fawn over my lockstokill/ Now the girls are gone and I'm on Minoxidil\") or inescapable whiteness (\"Rockin' soccer socks and sandals like, 'yeah, bro.'\") . Technically catchy but irritating all the same, \"Jonathan's Hope\" and \"Strawberries\" are the inexplicable singles, and as Wolf sings brutal rhymes such as, \"Slow pitching like a Vatican priest to be pope what? Dope,\" or, \"Your mom she sits while her hair is in curlers/ Smokes weed and listens to that Garrison Keillor/ That's how I'll live when I quit my rap career,\" there isn't so much of a melody as a curdling effect taking place in Wolf's mouth, like he's having an allergic reaction to his own lyrics. There too are remnants of Anticon.'s willfully arrhythmic approach to hiphop on \"Jonathan's Hope\" and \"Paper Hearts\", the latter of which might be the most unpleasant song of 2012. A noxious merger of topic, content, and delivery, Wolf cruelly describes a failed romantic encounter in flagrante: \"She's cute with little titties and a sense of humor/ But to tell you the truth sir, I pity the poor fool her,\" and, \"During sex I might put us in some joke positions/ But it's scary always how we end up in mission...airy like the daring men who fight to submission,\" aren't even the half of it. While there's no such thing as TMI in WHY? songs, it's nigh inconceivable to imagine someone listening to this for enjoyment. At the very least, Mumps, etc. creates a new wrinkle in discussing what \"career suicide\" can really mean. It's usually attributed to albums so off the grid that fans will inevitably refuse to follow, yet those always strike me as a cry for help, a need to trigger a reaction. But I don't think that's the case here. Mumps, etc. does have its moments that remind you how WHY? have always been a trial by fire that demands and often rewards intense loyalty that can't be shaken easily. On the contrary, Mumps, etc. sounds like WHY? reading their own eulogy. Sure, Wolf claims, \"I'll hold my own death as a card in the deck/ To be played when there are no other cards left,\" on the closing song, but \"Exegesis\" ended Alopecia making the same exact threats, so make your own \"cry Wolf\" joke if you must. It's just that so much of Mumps, etc. thinks of itself in the future tense, having already given up the fight. Even beyond Wolf's decidedly pessimistic take on his current occupation, most of the songs on Mumps, etc. just seem to opt out of delivering hooks when they could or should and meekly tap out before three minutes. But to really get to the heart of Mumps, etc.'s despondence, you have to look at \"Distance\", paradoxically the most musically accomplished and lyrically affecting song here. The sighing strings are a bit manipulative when Wolf says, \"I gotta keep my distance to withstand the silence of you missing when you're not there to listen to this nonsense,\" yet it's a real moment of resonance, and you're just left to wonder why such a typically candid lyricist took so long to get to the point. The structure of \"Distance\" would lead you to believe \"men and women might yet quote his modicum of the truth/ But never will they get right close to Jonathan Avram Wolf\" is the money quote, but it already happened. Because while Mumps, etc. expresses that Wolf is too in touch with his emotions to not potentially have great art left in him, it's just that I'm not sure even he believes WHY? is the best place for him to work it out anymore.
