Not that there's anything wrong with a clearly savvy listener like Borges resurrecting a bunch of oncefamiliar or neverremembered gems from other artists and interpreting them in her own individual voice and style. But two or three covers per record seems about enough, especially for someone who's already shown she has interesting things to say on her own. Borges' debut featured only four nonoriginals, yet between her 2007 sophomore release Diamonds in the Dark and the new The Stars Are Out, Borges (with her terrificallynamed band, the Broken Singles) has released 22 songs, a full 10 of which have previously been recorded by someone else almost all of them, it bears mentioning, by someone quite good.One clear testament to the fact that Borges is a pretty damn strong tunesmith is the fact that it's not always readily obvious which of her songs are the covers and which are her own compositions. Diamonds in the Dark included material penned by X and Tom Waits as well as a song popularized by Dolly Parton, yet Borges' own moodily metaphorical \"Modern Trick\" and heartbreaking \"Belle of the Bar\" stood nearly shoulder to shoulder with those selections, while \"The Day We Met\", \"Lonely Town of Love\", and \"Lord Only Knows\" showed her assured command of the barrock basics. Unfortunately, the originals on The Stars Are Out aren't always as impressive, and in fact some of the \"is this a cover?\" headscratching owes more to Borges' imitative sonic and lyrical choices, like the outdated talk of \"party dresses\" on the girlgroupinfluenced \"Me and Your Ghost\" or the overt fusion of southern rock and bubblegum girlpunk on the opening \"Do It For Free\". Both of these songs are fine for what they are, but do worryingly seem to be the kind of pastiche stuff that normally would represent the highwater mark for a coversdependent artist. Luckily, we have \"Symphony\" to prove that's not the case with Borges it's a lovely, arty song largely devoid of barrock influence, marked by pensive acoustic guitar, soaring violin and a wonderfully affectless vocal turn from its author.And then there are the covers themselves, of course, which I'll admit are admirably inspired in the sheer variety of Borges' source material, and on the whole quite engagingly read. NRBQ's \"It Comes to Me Naturally\" is barrock boilerplate, and it's pretty hard to fuck up Smokey Robinson (Borges doesn't on \"Being with You\"), but unearthing the 1980 nugget \"Yesterday's Love\" from Costello soundalikes Any Trouble is certainly laudable, as is digging up the Lemonheads' shaggy \"Ride with Me\" and daring to take on \"No One Will Ever Love You\" from the Magnetic Fields' classic 69 Love Songs. Borges remains a skilled, sensitive interpreter, and because she seems so comfortable in her skin as a keenly sympathetic music buff and sometime songwriter, it's hard to really knock the path she's currently following. Still, I can't help wishing she'd let her own muse have a bit more of the spotlight. "}
