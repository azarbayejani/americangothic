But it turns out that your mom was totally wrong: Portland's The Thermals have successfully flicked off all notions of inevitable evolution, eschewing presumed sophistication for dumb, youthful glee. 25 seconds into The Thermals' sophomore record, Fuckin A, shrieks of feedback fade into power chords, Hutch Henry begins lodging demands, and it becomes alarmingly clear that The Thermals' founding aesthetic grimy, lofi garage punk will endure eternally, a snarled, hyperactive, and unchanging homage to goofy basement tapes and kitchen acoustics. That Fuckin A was recorded by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla (who mastered the band's debut, 2001's More Parts Per Million) is strikingly apropos; The Thermals are not about reinvention, and Fuckin A is obviously not at all concerned with growing up, even on studio time. Mostly, Fuckin A is as stupidly (and gloriously) irreverent as its title, all adolescent threechord slams and snotty, selfchampioning chants, a seamless extension of the urgency introduced on More Parts Per Million. But despite all their snark and selfrepetition, The Thermals are still an immensely likable outfit; like a little brother demanding unconditional love, pulling down your pants and then begging for a dollar, The Thermals ingratiate themselves quickly and curiously, working against your most rational and justifiable complaints. It's not so much that the band sounds like kids (although sometimes, they sorta do), it's that they're brazenly and addictively selfconfident, hopped up on spit and adrenaline, fueled by the rewards of their own dumb fun. Frontman Hutch Henry's nasal shouts are uncannily similar to Mountain Goat John Darnielle's, and while The Thermals' lyrics tend to skew a bit more simplistic (\"It's our trip and/ And we're not listening.../ We won't flinch/ We don't give a shit\"), Henry still wields Darnielle's brand of sharp, scrappy charm awfully well. That The Thermals are the direct descendents of tweefolk duo Hutch and Kathy can sometimes seem ridiculous, particularly given The Thermals' obvious proclivity for brash, antifolk stomps, but the influence of their lineage becomes more evident the harder you listen tracks like \"God and Country\" admit The Thermals' appropriately desperate politics (\"Pray for a new state/ Pray for assassination\"), while \"Remember Today\" sees Henry adopt a Dylanesque mix of sentimentality and weird humor (\"Anything you can see/ You can probably feel/ Anyone far away/ You can probably charge at\").Fuckin A is a bit more political, a bit cleaner, and a bit less exuberant than its predecessor, but ultimately, the message is the same. That this is somehow more charming than irritating speaks directly to The Thermals' central prowess: beautiful indiscretion. "}
