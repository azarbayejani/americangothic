{"label":" Astralwerks / DFA","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/9340/homepage_large.68bd8e73.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tim Finney","artist":"Various Artists","title":"The DFA Remixes: Chapter Two","text":" On the one hand it is a largely superfluous exercise to consider the second collection of the DFA's remixes as a separate entity from its predecessor; in general terms, Chapter Two delivers more of the same, with about the same measure of success. On the other, it's too tempting not to go into further detail: Although slightly less consistent than its predecessor, Chapter Two somehow offers a stronger (or at least sharper) vision of the duo's talents, the collection's weaker moments providing an added lustre to its successes, and its successes revealing deeper and more surprising insights into the why and the how of James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy's value as remixers.First, the slight missteps: While every track here ramps up the DFA's catalogue of production tricks to decadent levels, some songs remain dubious propositions no matter how many cowbells are imported. The duo may concoct charmingly forlorn melodies on their remix of N.E.R.D.'s \"She Wants to Move\", but they're wasted on Pharrell's sneering, preening and ultimately vacuous performance. Curiously, the soundalike remix of Nine Inch Nails' \"The Hand That Feeds\" should suffer the same fate, but is instead a success partly due to the remix's sparkling synth riffs, but also to Reznor's ear for a good chorus. The DFA's loyalty to their source material is one of their great strengths but also an occasional liability, as there's only so much they can do to save limp songs (see also their attempts to polish up Chromeo's \"Destination: Overdrive\" with ostentatious synth explosions).But these are all older tracks, and perhaps my ambivalence towards them is just a reflection of their overfamiliarity, unfairly rendering them predictable and pro forma in execution when compared to the increasing grandeur of the duo's recent efforts. In an elaborate comingofage ceremony, their take on Goldfrapp's \"Slide In\" from last year encapsulates everything you might want from a DFA remix, chunky live disco giving way to big pop choruses breaking down into a percussive jam drifting into an ambient interlude building to a rousing dancefloor finish. It's so effortlessly, astonishingly large that it makes me wonder if perhaps the DFA are now, if anything, underrated, damned by the faint praise of fans who think they're cool and knowing when really they want to be wideeyed and earnest and possessed by religious fervour. \"Slide In\" may be a pastiche of the past, but was the past ever writ so large as this?While the track may be a great career summation, ultimately Chapter Two is more interesting for what it suggests about the DFA's future intentions, and here the 2006 inclusions are more telling: in their hands, Tiga's \"Far From Home\" performs the same chugging, electronic krautrocktoKraftwerk shortcircuit as Spacemen 3's \"Big City\", only with what sound like MIDIhorn fanfares propelling the track to absurd levels of tunefulness. Hot Chip's \"Colours\" meanwhile is the halcyonic flipside to the stark electronic pulses of the duo's remix of \"(Just Like We) Breakdown\" (included on Chapter One), a stately procession through resonant organs, laser zaps and glittering synth arpeggios. No longer synonymous with punky live disco, on these tracks the duo are closer to spacesuited studio boffins, abandoning the sweaty, gritty masculinity of bassled funk for the sexless, frictionless expanses of pure melody and sparkling soundforsound'ssake; far from being ambassadors for \"dance music with a human face\", the DFA now want to create soundtracks for the triumphant glide of the Star Child in 2001: A Space Odyssey.But it's probably dangerous to attach a toostraightforward narrative to their development, as Chapter Two's greatest and most delightful surprise is its closer, a remix of UNKLE's \"In a State\" hailing from 2003. Its darkly mysterious deep house groove unfurls with delicious patience, quickly reaching an unbearable intensity and sustaining it over the course of its thirteen relatively uneventful minutes. It is, quietly, this compilation's most remarkable offering: We know that that the DFA can do dynamic mutation as well as anyone, but Chapter Two reveals that it's their quest to become pioneers of the hypnotic groove that is the more seductive.
