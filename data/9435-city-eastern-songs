Like, um Bright Eyes has Desaparecidos, Elliott Smith had Heatmiser, and even John Mayer fronted his Trio (BlackBerry?). Jeffrey Lewis, a comic book artist and singer/songwriter who emerged from New York's antifolk scene, juxtaposes both sides of the acoustic/electric divide while making the unholy transition from lofi geekfolkie to studioshiny parttime punk on third album City & Eastern Songs, recorded with brother Jack on bass and some vocals. Why do we even bother? Such questions keep Jeffrey Lewis up nights. On rambling urbanbohemian fantasia \"Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror\", an Ltrainriding Lewis asks Bonnie \"Prince\" or a sunglassclad doppelganger whether email interviews and polite critical notices merit turning our dreams into hobbies i.e., \"Is it worth being an artist or an indie rock star, or are you better off without it?\" and receives his admittedly lame, possibly sexist answer only after getting violently fucked, Palacestyle. This song is witty, selfaware, and preposterous, like Art Brut set loose on hipsterdom with backporch acoustic guitars. Other quiet moments are sometimes also affecting, as restrained fiddles and his \"Simpsons\"like squeakyteen vocals help offset a digitalage sterility absent from early tapehiss soliloquies like \"The Chelsea Hotel Oral Sex Song\" and \"Back When I Was Four\". Lewis's selfhypercritical narrator is constantly on the verge of failure, whether in comic books, music, or amid the Velvets' bababas and scary octopi of \"Don't Be Upset\" love. Like filmmaker Andrew Bujalski, Lewis is an auteur of awkward youth, and he shares Mike Skinner's neurotic gift for examining mundane details so obsessively that universal feelings emerge. \"You'll never again see the angle of the street that you saw from that window,\" Lewis muses on whydidn'tIevermopbefore reflection \"Moving\", then slides the key under the door.  Still, Lewis just can't keep his rock side separate. Here faster songs like \"Time Machine\" and \"Something Good\" come off as boneheaded garage rawk think Ben Kweller's sophomore album compared to the ramshackle Beat Happening happeningness of such predecessors as \"Another Girl\". Meanwhile, even the acoustic \"Singing Tree\" would've been better had it been, as one often hopes, an elaborate Three Amigos joke. On \"Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror\", Lewis imagines being a \"a natural artist you love or hate but can't deny\". While City & Eastern Songs occasionally exhibits an undeniable talent unique enough that Lewis really should keep torturing himself for his art (sorry, Jeffrey Lewis's girlfriend!), it's really an album to love and hate.
