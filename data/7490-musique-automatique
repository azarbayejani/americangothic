Schiel","artist":"Stereo Total","title":"Musique Automatique","text":" When I was seven years old, I received a Casio keyboard from Santa Claus. You know the kind: 220 secondrate synth voices, several drum kits, and an auto rhythm section that could cover everything from \"piano waltz\" to \"hiphop\" and back to \"slow rock.\" Besides learning the theme to the Young and the Restless on that keyboard, one of my favorite elementary school pastimes was experimenting with the sound effects. Of course, I was seven, so I thought musical innovation consisted of playing \"London Bridge\" on the \"crickets\" setting. When fourth grade came around, I even entered a citywide contest with an emotional improvised piece entitled \"Life Before Death\", which consisted of alarm sounds interspersed between melodramatic minorkey pipe organ lines backed by a threepiece jazz combo. Back in my day, it was all about the juxtaposition of disparate elements. But now in the age that disowns Casio (if you would consider Stephen Merritt the spokesperson for an age), synths and samplers are put to much more serious uses. Man, did you see that Linkin Park video where they're playing on that statue of Buddha? That synth player dude is seriously into it he moves like a madman! Can't cage him! Do you think he really puts that much emotion into all that button pressing? But I digress. Spinning on my stereo at the moment is Stereo Total's latest (that's \"towtall\" if you ever want to say it out loud), a band that bridges synthpop with kitschrock and dangerously brings me back to my Casio days, as well as reminding me very much of Serge Gainsbourg. Musique Automatique, Total's fourth fulllength, finds the halfFrench/halfGerman duo of FraxE7oise Cactus and Brezel Göring ditching the premeditation and kicking out the triggerhappy sampling behind their deceivingly simplistic pop approach to songwriting. Lyrics on this record are sung in French, German, English, and Turkish, and love is their common focal point: love of the radio, love of robots, love of French highways, love of love, and so on. Total's arrangements are built around Cactus' infectious pop melodies, with accompaniment provided by guitars and live drums covered by synthesizer, pocketsampler, and drumatix (I'm guessing that's some kind of archaic drum machine).Musique Automatique opens with \"Automatic Music\", a bouncy number centering around a callandresponse between Cactus and Göring that plays off the suffix \"ique\": \"La musique/ Automatique/ La musique/ Nostalgique/ La musique/ Pathétique/ La musique/ Chaotique.\" The two verses of the song sung by Göring about sound traveling through the soundsystem to the ears of the listener kick in with a folky guitar scale fillin, defying the synthpop of the rest of the track. But unlike my \"Life Before Death\" experiment, this juxtaposition is crazily successful. The second track, \"L'Amour \\xC0 3\", is decidedly closer to radiofriendly pop, but doesn't drop the kitschy synth. The lyrics, again in French, sing about the love of threeway love (from bit translations in the liner notes): \"I know it's hippieshit/ But I say it loud/ With the three of us/ I love it.\" \"Wir Tanzen im 4Eck\", the first of the tracks in German, and also the first of five covers included, is built around Cactus' sampled vocals structured into an extremely infectious chant. \"Forever 16\", in English, is the first track dominated by live instrumentation with bleeps thrown in as ornaments, and it begs reference to the start/stop nature of \"BBC\" from the first Austin Powers flick. The sixteen tracks of Musique Automatique (including a Turkish reiteration of \"Forever 16\" and an English rendition of \"L'Amour \\xC0 3\") keep with the exotic linguohopping and synthbopping, and manages never to get tired or annoying. In fact, I thought that I could never have this much fun with synthpop because of its stereotypic banality. But Stereo Total has made me learn to love, among other things, fun loving. "}
