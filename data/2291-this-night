On that album, Bejar found a perfect balance between tight acoustic guitars and looser electric rock, and none of it sounded the least bit deliberate or sloppy.Streethawk, in other words, is everything that This Night is not. Whereas Streethawk whipped out twelve songs in fortyfour minutes, This Night draws fifteen songs out along an interminable sixtyeight minutes. Do the math. Most of the songs here are overlong, messy things. Streethawk may have been unpredictable, but it also felt as though Bejar carefully considered every move. This Night, on the other hand, feels entirely haphazard without purpose. The title track that opens the album is no exception. Several uncoordinated guitars try to find each other's rhythm, then one takes over for some of the laziest strumming you've ever heard. Bejar enters with his adenoidal voice, not unlike Robyn Hitchcock's, as he sings, \"They led us on/ They said it would be yours/ Tear down the borders, stop patrolling the shores, let us in.\" The lyrics are no surprise. Bejar has always been a bit enigmatic as often silly as he is poetic but his music always made up for the shortcomings of his odd voice and nonsensical lyrics. Here, he has no such bailout. The music is all confused and muddled, and largely devoid of any compelling artistry. And \"This Night\" is just the first of many songs that devolve into a jumbled, selfindulgent mess of electric guitars and exasperated yelping. \"Holly Going Lightly\" stumbles all over itself, with all kinds of masturbatory riffing and noodling that's enough to give anyone 70s flashbacks. Bejar, meanwhile, sings \"should know better\" ad nauseam, and all I can think is, \"Tell me about it.\" The same goes for the nearly eightminute \"Hey, Snow White\", yet another poor attempt at a longwinded rocker a la Neil Young & Crazy Horse. Oddly, though, even some of the shorter tracks here feel equally endless. All hope isn't entirely lost, though. \"Here Comes the Night\", with its melodica and chirpy background vocals, recalls some of the more whimsical side of earlier Destroyer. The crisp pop of \"Modern Painters\" would have fit nicely on Streethawk. And \"Goddess of Drought\", by far the best track here, consists of surprise! just Bejar and his acoustic guitar, with quirky lines like, \"I was looking good on the day that you fell for the way I looked.\" In recording This Night, Bejar largely abandoned his Streethawk lineup, enlisting two members for guest spots only. The replacements are unwelcome, if only because of the final product, but I hate to blame anyone but Bejar himself. He reportedly left the familiar environs of Vancouver, British Columbia, and created This Night in the decidedly less tranquil city of Montr√©al. Let's just hope that when he grudgingly admits (on \"Trembling Peacock\"), \"Vancouver made me, I guess it's true,\" that he hasn't sworn off his hometown altogether. "}
