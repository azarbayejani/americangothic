{"label":" Troubleman Unlimited","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/1783/homepage_large.7359bdb2.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Matthew Murphy","artist":"Chariots","title":"Congratulations","text":" There's just the faintest hint of nostalgia coloring the edges of Chariots' debut album Congratulations, which feels like something of a mid90s throwback, combining the complex ferocity of such bygone groups as Drive Like Jehu and Jawbox with the streamlined pummel of the Jesus Lizard. And though Chariots don't actually succeed in turning any new noiserock sod, they deliver these 10 tracks with such passionate, frenetic panache that they're able to deftly sidestep the numerous landmines that could've potentially fatally wounded the project. Recorded by Dave Gardner (who has also worked with Rocket From the Crypt, Detachment Kit, and Hot Snakes), Congratulations is loaded with massive, airtight riffs yet fully outfitted with invigorating whiplash contours as when the driving, headlong locomotion of \"Hips Unite\" dovetails abruptly into a handclapping, pintraising hooligan stomp worthy of AC/DC. The heavily effected vocals of Travis Bos, whose work in Song of Zarathustra was often abrasive enough to qualify as a dealbreaker, remain forceful but manage to be relatively nuanced and (on occasion) surprisingly tuneful. It's long been my opinion, however, that the success or failure of such an enterprise is almost wholly determined by the quality of the rhythm section, and in that respect Chariots emerge smelling like clover. Bassist Arthur Gandy plays with the same spare, limber economy with which David Sims once anchored the Jesus Lizard, while Matt Kepler's pounding, casually intricate drumming serves as a virtual focal point on hyperactive tracks like \"GRPSTX\" or \"Bored Housewife Syndrome\". The album's title track finds the group expertly matching dissonant scrawls of guitar to Gandy's lively Peter Hook bassline, while Bos screams indistinct unsweetened nothings and his partycrashing keyboards flirt shamelessly on the sidelines. Meanwhile \"Number One With a Bullet\" revisits some of the more metallic territory covered by Zarathustra, before the album finally collapses onto the broad shoulders of \"The Laundry Room in This Building Is Equipped With a Burglar Alarm\"; the entire group wrapping their collective fists around the song's meaty core and squeezing it into oblivion.
