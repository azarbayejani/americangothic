In 2007, Nick Cave gave up the ghost of youth, declaring an outandout midlife crisis with Grinderman, a brilliant, crude, strippeddown quartet. Made up of members of his Bad Seeds, the nascent group's selftitled debut was naked about its grotesqueries, as Cave futzed with a guitar for the first time, wailed about the \"No Pussy Blues\", and sucked in his gut with hopes of getting laid.It was an inspired latecareer move for the then 50yearold, invigorating and recalibrating the pianoaffixed, doomsaying troubadour. Critics fell over themselves proclaiming the return of the former Birthday Party frontman's skuzzy side. A year later you could hear the punk reverberations in 2008's Bad Seeds album, Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! But Grinderman, though fierce and often hilarious, weren't exactly a great band. Young bands no matter how old have to learn new tricks, and this one had to find interesting ways to be messy. Grinderman 2 is a sequel of sorts, but mostly an improvement. The band has widened their sound and sexual pursuits, but also poked around at the edges of decrepitude. What does life look like on the other side of crisis?Well, it's schizophrenic and sloppy. Those feral urges are still there; consider the album cover's lupine avatar. But Cave and the band who typically improvise structure and lyrics have kept the themes consistent across nine songs. And they're not terribly different from what interests him on albums with the Bad Seeds: God, Death, and America are gospel. But sexual filialness Cave seems to be calling himself \"Daddy\" and yowling at his childlover a lot here takes an uncomfortable precedence. \"Worm Tamer\" and \"Heathen Child\" are almost comically lascivious. \"I stick my fingers in your biscuit jar/ And crush all your gingerbread men,\" he moans, aping Howlin' Wolf on \"Kitchenette\", one of the album's best songs. And later, \"What has that husband of yours ever given to you?/ Oprah Winfrey on a plasma screen.\" That's a great line, the sort of insinuating thing that might get Cave into bed with a frustrated housewife, but it's also miserably desperate, selfdeprecating stuff.Cave has been leading a full life lately, finishing his second novel in 2009, composing scores for John Hillcoat's films, and writing a few screenplays of his own. But he has rarely been as experimental and unafraid as he is here. The pastoral \"Palaces of Montezuma\" is a \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" for heroin addicts, haunted by visions of Miles Davis, Marilyn Monroe, JFK, and \"a custardcolored superdream of Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen.\" It's unhinged and unerringly beautiful. So often, Cave is wise about the state of it all; he seems to know he's on the wrong side of things life, love, fear but he won't give up the fight.Like much of Cave's work, there is an ominous sense of dread always creeping. But unlike previous work, there's a speed and intensity to Grinderman 2 unheard before. From the chugging build of \"Mickey Mouse and the Goodbye Man\" through the psychhaze of \"Bellringer Blues\", there are few opportunities to catch your breath. \"Evil\" even lurches toward death metal. \"What I Know\" is a rare and tender respite from the fury; it's a plaintive ballad to precocity, process, and nothing. \"Oh I know, yeah I know,\" Cave intones, never quite revealing what it is. There isn't much to the song a stray, buzzing crackle; a faroff wordless melody; a quietly strummed guitar. It's just a simple moment in a savage life. "}
