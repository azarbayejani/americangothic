If g**** is now understood to be everything British, brutish, blackish, hollered, squawking, Dizzeed, manic, squelching, and/or Wiled out, this wouldbe ambassador is running off the genre's potholed backroads onto freshly rolledover blacktop that's still steaming in its stealth smoothness. Instead of clobbering like a crackedup Thing popping Pow! pills, this East London MC nightcrawls through the shadows, slipping deep lyrical daggers over beats that are meticulously polished, waxed, and primed to play mirror to Kano's steep autobiographical musings. A fierce student of both hyperspeed UK beat styles and (gasp!) American hiphop, this doeeyed poster boy's intrinsic influences are often bore out by an uncanny camouflow that slyly adapts to Home Sweet Home's varied sonic textures. \"If it's a good flow, it must be Kane,\" he brags, expertly utilizing the naturally egomaniacal third person. Luckily, unlike many delusional, selfsatisfied young crowers, Kano offers enough solid evidence of his vocal dexterity to make Matlock blush. While recent breakouts like the Game rep their idols with simple ad nauseam shoutouts, Kano's nods are more intrinsic to his rhyming style. Though it's nearly ruined by a cringeworthy, Black Sabbathsampling chorus, the clippedguitar \"99 Problems\" Jr. scuffup \"I Don't Know Why\" finds the MC acutely aping JayZ's Blueprintera cadence (along with a couple Oompa Loompaesque singsong lines) as he lands prettyboy punches with a knowing grin. The album's leadoff title track showcases his roidedchameleon adaptability as he eases listeners into his wordy realm by initially windingup with a slow, offkilter flow before gunning inthepocket fastballs all over the track's airtight electronic playing field, courtesy of frequent collaborator Mikey J. Produced by famed world traveler Diplo, the frighteningly impressive \"Reload It\" provides a living, breathing drum 'n' bass gauntlet that Kano duly annihilates as it skips between doubletime snaresnap and ambling, woozy wobble. With guest shots from Ritalindefying mic sharks Demon and D Double E, the track also offers a crystalline illustration of why Kano's transAtlantic potential is off the charts: Relative to his peers' slangslinging verbal zigzags, Kano's immaculate enunciation and unruffled demeanor are easily deciphered without a gullymade RWD decoder ring. Not to say his wordplay and content are simple. Along with a widerange of production styles and multiflow grandstanding comes an equally assorted thematic breadth. Whether he's bitchingout brut bouncers with verbal assaults (\"Typical Me\"), ruminating on teenage love (the Streetsproduced \"Nite Nite\"), callingout closedminded youths (\"Nobody Don't Dance No More\"), offering a megaton boastathon (the already classic \"P's & Q's\"), or just getting his Hennessy on (\"Remember Me\"), Kano injects nearly every track on Home with refreshing depth. Backed by luscious windchimes and chipmunk squeal vox samples, the loveydovey \"Brown Eyes\", with its notsoromantic refrain of \"I don't want to fall in love,\" is noticeably more conflicted and realistic than your typical femaledemo pandering fare. Stellar album cuts like the introspective stunner \"Sometimes\" see Kano tempering his encroaching stardom with secondthoughts. \"When they say I'm the next one to blow I say why do they think me,\" he admits, \"All I do is stay in mostly and sleep/ And all I do is watch Channel U and drink tea/ Why me?\" He combats such internal struggles with staggering maturity and an appealing, hardworking sense of earning ends on his own terms. \"The hood think I'm signed, they like 'I swear he is'/ But I'm still in the grind writing lines all day, every night,\" he insists with focused intensity and ghetto guilt on the bluecollar anthem \"9 to 5\", taking absolutely nothing in his life for granted. Such striving, selfmotivational forces are no stronger than on \"Signs of Life\", a sixminuteplus cautionary tale marked by arch strings and doomboom scifi bass. Crushing the easymade glorification of hiphop's drugslinging stereotype, he points a clenched fist at a lockedin bruva: \"You ain't so rich now/ I bet you feel like a prick now/ Cause where's all your fancy shit now/ Where's your whips, chicks, and your bits now/ Shit, you should have fixed up/ Fuck drugs, the mic you should've picked up/ And it was all for big bucks, now your sittin' in a cell doing situps.\" Kano doesn't just defy the sonic tradition of grime on Home Sweet Home, he defies the tidy boxes MCs are usually plopped in upon their arrival. \"I'll never have a calm day's rest until my album's in stores next to Kanye West,\" he claims, and though the likelihood of a record store sorting their wares by first name seems slim, the two MCs do share an urge for multiplicity. Laying down roads every which way, this nimble artist's future destination is promising and unpredictable: No matter what happens to grime, Kano is poised to endure. "}
