Asch gave Smith a $200 advance to compile a threevolume anthology of American folk music, fed him peyote buttons, and set up an office for Smith in the Folkways building on West 46th Street in midtown Manhattan. Smith's compulsion to collect was pathological (he also boasted a trove of 30,000 Ukrainian Easter eggs), and he is typically defined via varying euphemisms for weird Moe Asch's biographer, Peter Goldsmith, describes Smith as a man \"â€¦whose extraordinary intelligence and creativity could be both highly disciplined and hopelessly broadranging,\" while Robert Christgau accurately christens him \"a strange, bearded little man.\" In 1952, Folkways released The Anthology of American Folk Music, a collection of folk, blues, and country songs from the 1920s and 30s, culled from Smith's personal collection and ranging from the relatively popular (the Carter Family, Lightnin' Hopkins, Dock Boggs, Blind Lemon Jefferson) to the obscure (Didier Herbert, Nelstone's Hawaiians, Coley Jones). The Anthology was considered sacred work to the folk revivalists of the late 1950s over a halfcentury (and a CD reissue by Smithsonian Folkways) later, Smith's box is still considered the premiere American folk collection available for public purchase. Allen Ginsberg rightfully dubbed it \"a historic bomb.\" Between 1999 and 2000, producer Hal Willner and Meltdown Festival artistinresidence Nick Cave staged a series of epic fivehourplus concerts in London, New York, and Los Angeles, intending to celebrate Smith's work as an experimental filmmaker and musicologist by pairing contemporary artists with bits of Smith's films and The Anthology's ancient folksongs: Beck, Beth Orton, Phillip Glass, Van Dyke Parks, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Steve Earle, Lou Reed, Marianne Faithfull, and a mess of other artists agreed to participate. The Harry Smith Project documents the concerts, pairing two CDs of live cuts with a DVD of concert footage (some featuring the legendary camerastylings of D.A. Pennebaker and his team) and The Old, Weird America, a documentary about the global endeavor.  Working musicians cover The Anthology's songs all the time, and The Harry Smith Project isn't the first time modern stabs have been documented in deference Smithsonian Folkways released The Harry Smith Connection in 1997, the soundtrack to a pair of tribute concerts held in Vienna, Virginia to celebrate The Anthology's CD reissue (featuring tracks by Dave Van Ronk, Jeff Tweedy, The New Lost City Ramblers, and others.) Still, many of these songs are so specific to their time and place Beale Street, dusty Delta crossroads, southern chain gangs, Appalachian cabins, Tennessee coal mines that a contemporary recreation, no matter how wellintentioned or wellrendered, still feels a little ridiculous, like stomping through Colonial Williamsburg eating a hot dog and wearing a baseball cap. And while plenty of the cuts on The Anthology were \"covers\" to begin with (most early country and folksongs were reworkings of traditional gospel songs), they were captured at a time when folk music functioned a little bit differently when it was a vital and necessary method of documenting and lamenting the daily struggles of the poor, and not yet a political tool or floppy, coffeehouse luxury. Consequently, The Harry Smith Project works best as homage: These songs are buried treasure, beloved not only for their melody and performance, but for what they indicate about an America long obliterated. It's always nice to hear them honored (and to appreciate their songcraft without being distracted by rudimentary production techniques), but plenty is lost in translation.  Howling the Carter Family hit \"Single Girl, Married Girl\", Petra Haden never quite captures Sara Carter's strained desperation (Sara's husband, Carter patriarch A.P., was notoriously absent; Sara later left him for his cousin, quit the band, and moved to California), sounding weirdly jubilant instead. Wilco's take on Richard Rabbit Brown's \"James Alley Blues\" is rich and convincing, with Jeff Tweedy grumbling on point, all sadfaced and earnest: \"Towns right now ain't nothing like they used to be/ I'll tell you all the truth/ Won't you take my word from me/ I seen better days and I ain't putting up with these.\" Beck's version of Robert Johnson's \"Last Fair Deal Gone Down\" features loads of sloppy slide and haphazard, soulful yelps, while the box's highlight is traditional cut \"Sail Away Lady\", performed by Uncle Bunt Stephens on the original Anthology, and rendered beautifully here by Van Dyke Parks and the Mondrian String Quartet. The Harry Smith Project inadvertently asks big questions about the state of contemporary blues and folk, and works as an honest, loving tribute to the songs that informed the musical sensibilities of countless performers and, hopefully, will lead its listeners straight back to the big, red box every American music fan should own.
