Crane is archetypal of a certain sort of thirtysomething indie dude. He's brainy and at least somewhat socially conscious (he served half of a twoyear stint in Teach for America), he knows his way around musicfriendly metropolises (currently living in Seattle, he did his TFA time in Chicago), and he can certainly identify with The Boston Globe sports writer Chad Finn's excellent blog about classic sports cards (BOAT's 2008 Topps 7\" EP came with five handdrawn cards, plus a stick of bubblegum). Crane's band, meanwhile, has been working on the fringes of the indie rock mainstream, receiving generally positive reviews. BOAT's fourth album, then, finds the Cranefronted fourpiece going through something of an underachiever's quarterlife crisis. On one hand, Dress Like Your Idols sees Crane, drummer Jackson Long, bassist/guitarist Mark McKenzie, and multiinstrumentalist Josh Goodman finally making their way into a real studio for the first time. On the other hand, that studio Seattle's Two Sticks Audio is already defunct. And the songs, like the album cover, are as inspired by the band's youth as ever, merging Stephen Malkmus's obliquely deadpan twang, Tullycraft's sugary sceneskewering, and Modest Mouse's \"reptile boy\" yelp. Where some slightly younger slackers have been opting for warped 1980s synthpop, BOAT continue to love the 90s: an era when they didn't know, as per the rueful title track, that \"the job you wanted doesn't exist.\" The result is the best album yet from a band whose style finally appears to be back in vogue, though its sometimesbitterly sardonic humor still won't be for everybody. When BOAT apply their newfound professionalism, Dress Like Your Idols outdresses more than just famously schlubby Doug Martsch, whose Built to Spill is one of nine bands paid tribute to on the album's memorably meta cover. First single \"(I'll Beat My Chest Like) King Kong\" sets a basic pop hook (\"I'll love you if you love me\") over crunchy guitars and boisterous drumming that could please fans of such similarly 90sminded bands as Surfer Blood, Yuck, or Free Energy (remember, the 90s also loved the 70s: Weezer, people!). John Roderick, whose underrated group the Long Winters gets its own albumcover homage, adds his drowsy, Pedro the Lionish backing vocals to \"Landlocked\", the record's screeching, pentup emotional centerpiece. As Crane sarcastically boasts elsewhere, \"If looks could kill, I'd slaughter you.\" While the caustic, slightly selfpitying edge to PBRpumping powerpop anthems like \"Classically Trained\" (which targets those lucky souls \"making art for a living\") and \"Kinda Scared of Love Affairs\" (which begins, almost a cappella, \"I'm not sure I want to be goodlooking\") may put a few people off, it's hard to fault the successfully bombastic execution for anything except cozy familiarity. \"In time you'll become a cynic,\" hyperreferential \"When Frank Black Says (No. 14 Baby)\" warns, adding, \"We're just like you.\" When Dress Like Your Idols transcends the archetypal 30ish indie dude's perhaps understandable cynicism, BOAT resemble their heroes in more ways than one. That's why the most revealing lyric, ultimately, turns out to be this: \"Nothing seems impossible to me.\" "}
