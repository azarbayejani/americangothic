Why did \"Pole\" have to retire his vinylmastering machine? It had so much poetry. The harmonies of a stylus bludgeoning vinyl surfaces to death as narcotic dub basslines and guitar jangles trudge through the hallways of an exEastern Bloc housing project that was all virgin territory back in '99. Most of the earliest artists on Betke's ~scape label seemed to extend our man's glitches including Kit Clayton's ectoplasmic subterraneandub and Jan Jelinek's loops, which robotized souljazz records. \"Glitches\" are barely heard on But Then Again, ~scape's fifthanniversary release. That's because the album collects work from the label's current roster, a group that now focus on contorting rhythms and harmonies into new, yet rather familiar shapes. Given ~scape's feted advancements of yore, few risks are taken here, but But Then Again still entertains. Opener, Cappablack's \"5th Dimension (Antiimperialism Disco)\" shoves the listener against the wall with its sample of a lady shouting about her inability to solve a math problem. A postNeptunes crunk beat follows as their rapper struggles to teach astrophysics. What this has to do with \"antiimperialism\" is up to you. Bus & Dabrye's \"What Is Paris?\" is better rooted in bboy culture thanks to its electrofunk moogs and stubbedtoe beats that sound like a hungover Kraftwerk. John Tejada's \"And Many More\" is a curious microhouse ballad that laments over Nintendo GameBoy melodies ultimately evoking the experience of staring at tombstone apartments at dusk. The artists who say the most with the slightest gestures create But Then Again's highlights. Jan Jelinek's \"Western Mimikry\" brilliantly dangles a loop of a sleepwalking jazzguitar riff in the breeze. Andrew Pekler's \"Unidentified\" is fine, absthinejazz that flickers obtuse rhythms as if Teo Macero produced Miles Davs in 2072. And then there is Mike Shannon's \"Remembrance\" which lets a geothermal dub rhythm find its way in the dark, while guest chanteuse June scolds, \"You promised heaven far, far away!\" The record's midlights are civil and pay their taxes. In \"We Like It Slow and Steady\", Deadbeat remixes his older dub thunderclaps into R&B; that encircles a streetlight. System's \"Hu Ra!!\" clickyclacks to a toy solider cadence with a melodica and clarinet duet frowning at the world. Headset & Soulo's \"The Fall of Knee High\" scores a few brownie points for its Tom Waitsmused, chaingang beats and squealing harmonicas. Let's just hope that ~scape doesn't see gold mines in the AORdub of Triola's \"Neuland\" and the Starbucksfriendly, litejazz of Epo's \"Doorstep\", on which their frontwoman sings \"sweet, sweet cherry pie\" in an herbal teawatered croon. Hey, wait a minute. Where did Pole go? Mr. Betke didn't even show up at his own party. But then again, maybe it's best to leave broken machines alone. "}
