Shattered 20th century taboos on human intimacy are the reason this music thrived; the genre moniker itself is a euphemism for doing it. And no one ever really needed to be told what albums called Slide it In or Pump or Please Please Me were on about. Enter Home's nearcriminally titled 16th album, Sexteen, which takes on a notverysubtly different project. Its brazen and unapologetic ads want you to know upfront: This is a concept record about fucking. What's remarkable is that Home mostly pulls it off. Sexteen's strong first movement pauses midcoitus to reflect on Homes of yesteryear. \"Straddle Me\" is somehow both a KamaSutrapluspiano pastoral and a throwback to the atmospheric chamber psych of the 13th Home record, 1998's Netherregions, a title I'll never read the same way again. At the album's thematic and literal center, \"Fucking\" is the song you buy a Home album for twominutes of bliss, sexedup and awkward as hell. Lewd synth, buoyant bass, impossibly catchy melody, all focused on a lyrical admission of why rock musicians do what they do: \"If you hadn't guessed, I will let you in/ On what drives all these knobs all that spin...All decisions are based on my singular goal of eliciting a response from you\". The titular dirty verb at the top of the chorus still staggers me just a little. Then there's that handful of tracks you knew a \"concept record about fucking\" had to have, most scattered across the record's uneven midsection. \"Bubble\", a merciful two minutes long, is a Modest Mousian funk mistake, complete with Andrew Deutsch's recorded phone call to a girl with whom he discusses his love of handjobs and how \"wound up\" he is. Urp.  Equally remarkable is the band's evergrowing stylistic depth, even if this is the least prog Home to date. You'll hear a pillow of The Soft Bulletinera Flaming Lips in \"Teasin' and Pleasin'\", which is fitting, given the band's association with Lips producer Dave Fridmann on XIV and the barelyheard and oftenbrilliant no.15. It's delivered via simple drums, cresting xylophone, and strings nearly swooning behind the melody. Massive bass and twangy distorted axes give \"Push\" a suggestive Stones/Skynryd menace. There's a hint of Sufjan Stevens to \"Driving and Paralyzing\"'s pulsing, layered chimes and bells. You might even think Prince or Beck, once or twice, as \"Slide\" and \"Rushing\" document Home's surprising efforts at stilted indie funk/soul, to mixed results. After 15 albums, I honestly didn't know they had it in 'em.  Lyrical treatment of \"the act\" itself ranges from the goofy Penthouse Letters schlock of, say, \"Juicy Ass\", to more heartfelt, grownup depictions of desire. Take \"So straddle me in the back captain's chair/ And let me bury my face in your hair\" (\"Straddle Me\"): on paper, a juvenile rhyme about quickie lust. But coupled with \"Accompany me west by car...\" and the track's lilting, languorous waltz (a Home trademark since the late 90s), it achieves an awkward, inviting sincerity and a snapshot of copulation and travel a zillion miles from any of Frank Zappa's 200 Motels. Similarly, the orchestral balladry of \"Come Like You're on Fire\", a song about making your special someone do just that, proclaims that \"sated and asleep is the next best thing\". And so it is.  What's difficult about Sexteen is that even its strongest, most familiar, and Homecaliber tracks all feature dollops of that toughtoswallow procreation subject matter. Adherence to \"concept\" and erotic mood renders the weaker material all the more tiresome and interruptive. A shorter, tighter record of Amaterial might've equaled more than the sum of its private parts. At 19 tracks, Sexteen's themed collection presents serious challenges to \"going all the way\" with it, if you catch my drift.  Add CD packaging art that brings intercourse, astronomy, and cute little forest creatures enigmatically together, and you've got one complex and unexpected 16th album. Sexteen is a mitigated success and not nearly Home's best effort. But it proves itself so maturely sexual and selfaware, so happily derivative and vulgar, it helped me be truly, rightly horrified, maybe for the first time, by \"Better run girl!/ You're much too young, girl!\" as it crept down from supermarket PA speakers toward innocents below.
