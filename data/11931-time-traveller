{"label":" Decon","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/12045/homepage_large.11ee91a4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"Plantlife","title":"Time Traveller","text":" The title track that opens this album is kinda funny: As a minimalistic clicktrack/electric piano composition murmurs away behind him, a pitchedup Mr. Wiggles/Quasimoto voice claims to have a hand in dozens of pivotal moments in rap, funk, and rock history, sort of like a more benevolent bboy geekout version of \"Sympathy for the Devil\" (\"I had Melle Mel's back when he was by the edge/ I used to wear them big suits with the Talking Heads\"). It's cute and all, but it's also a bit of misdirection: most of the names dropped in this track belong to hiphop artists, yet for all the invocations of rap icons from Bambaataa to Dre to Dilla, Plantlife's Time Traveller sounds a lot more like a record informed by those artists' production influences rather than the artists themselves a second cousin to hiphop, once removed. And if that cartoon spaceman voice stops short of admitting he was there when Prince decided to start wearing purple, the rest of the record spends a good deal of time proving it. If the paisley vibe hasn't hit you after reading the tracklist (\"Agirllikeudeservesamanwhotreatsuhowulike\"; \"Got 2 Find a Better Way\"; \"Fool for U\"), it probably will after the dirtyminded heavy ballad \"Don't Go Around Looking for a Broken Heart\" and the panting, guitardriven comeon of \"Lovetoy\" (\"Sexy girl, I wanna be your lover boy/ Sexy girl, I wanna be your lovetoy\"). And if lead singer/producer Jack Splash doesn't have Prince's vocal range he mostly sticks to a somewhat raspy falsetto, which is engagingly dizzy enough to help you ignore how onedimensional it is he definitely has the babyI'mastar routine down. And judging from the darkly comic references to ego tripping and loveless sex in \"They Pay Me 4 This (Typqlsupastar)\", he knows how to subvert it as well. But on the whole the album's more in the spirit of 1999's omnivorous r&b than a fullfledged knockoff of it, and there're plenty of other familiar funk touchstones all over its DayGlo surface PFunk, Zapp, the Ohio Players, Rick James to give it a broader personality that isn't derivative of much else aside from a certain widespanning era. The music on Time Traveller is a bit more postmodern and outlandish than the neosoul production and session work Splash has done for the likes of John Legend and Estelle, ranging from modernized Sly & the Family Stoneesque raveups (\"Outta Control\") to sleek rollerdisco (\"Rollerskate Jam\") to semiLatin yachtsoul (\"Sun Shines Through Your Love\") to a guitardrenched closing slow jam Shuggie Otis would envy (\"Fool for U\"). What it lacks in a unified style it makes up for in a referential (and reverential) enthusiasm that anyone with a subscription to Wax Poetics should recognize as an individualized, wellcrafted love letter to funk gone by and funk yet to come.
