{"label":" Drive-In","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/4847/homepage_large.0a1944bd.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Scott Plagenhoef","artist":"The Lucksmiths","title":"Naturaliste","text":" The lead track on Melbourne indie pop trio The Lucksmiths' 2001 album Why Doesn't That Surprise Me is named \"Music to Hold Hands To\". The title is a perfect description of the band's aims: to write sweet yet polite songs about crushes that are reciprocated, comfortable shoulders on which to lean, and valuing understated, tender moments. The lyric, however \"I could never understand you/ Hating music to hold hands to/ Sometimes something you can dance to is the last thing that you need\" hint at a different reality, one of heartache, disappointment, and poor timing. In The Lucksmiths' world, the results never seem to match expectations and it's often for a lack of trying. These charming young chaps have made a career relishing unemployment, idle conversations at the pub, and lazy, sunny days. On their sixth album, Naturaliste, many of the band's hallmarks clever turns of phrases, a gift for sweet melodies, an odd obsession with the weather are present, but their once mostly jaunty, jangly pop is now often swapped for wistful, plaintive melodies. The band seems to be grappling with the perils of advancing age (all three of vocalist/drummer Tali White, guitarist Marty Donald, and bassist Mark Monnone write songs). Where they once sung about awkward first meetings and nervous beginnings, they're now lamenting lost loves and uncomfortable endings. Some of the record's best tracks have tinges of regret or painful selfawareness: the vanity of opener \"CameraShy\", the pensive, longdistance love of \"The Sandringham Line\", and the misplaced familiarity of lover's spats in \"The Perfect Crime\". Former single \"Midweek Midmorning\", a punchy, irresistible ode to savoring the moment while it lasts, is another highlight. Best of all perhaps is \"Stayaway Stars\", which features melancholy tonguetwisters such as: \"What sorry sights we sometimes are/ These sameshit nights under stayaway stars/ These sameshit nights in the saddest bars/ The city lights and the stayaway stars.\" So here are The Lucksmiths: Drifting away from lovers, cocooned by loneliness, a bit paralyzed by both the encroachment of age and having to put juvenilia in the rearview. And they blame no one but themselves. \"I'm trying hard not to be so antisocial/ Truth be told, I'm not entirely hopeful,\" White sings on \"The Boy That Goes Out\". \"Look back on brighter days/ A microscope on how the simple things are done/ But don't look too long to the sun/ 'Cause you'll see faults/ As there are faults in everyone,\" he warns on \"Sleep Well\". This is the sound of the loneliness of the aging indie pop star. The Lucksmiths still possess an eye for detail, ornate harmonies, bewitching melodies, and sharp wit, but each is in less supply these days. Those who have grown old with the band will find comfort in Naturaliste's autumnal tones; if there's still a fair bit of spring in your step, it's probably best to keep a Happy Secret. "}
