It's also their best release yet, but it it takes some time to sink in. The sounds that X&O (Liz Wendelbo and Sean McBride) make are regularly referred to as \"coldwave\" deadpan D.I.Y. postpunk filtered through brutal drum machines and synth lines so brittle and thin you could practically snap them over your knee. It's easy music to appreciate but hard to outright love this stuff in large doses (that held even for last year's excellent look at the original coldwave movement from the late 1970s and early 80s, The Minimal Wave Tapes, Vol. 1). The formal rigidity of Xeno & Oaklander's artistic aims can cause them to blend together at first listen, and since this isn't widereaching, crowdpleasing stuff, it takes some commitment to stick with it. So Sets & Lights is more of the same chilly, dusty electronic gloom, but they've stuck with their aesthetic and gotten better. Compared to 2009's attentiongetting Sentinelle, Sets & Lights is fullbodied and lush. Artists who release music on Wierd typically forgo computers\", so the fact that Wendelbo and McBride were able to coax such austere beauty from their machines is impressive in its own right. The highlights seem to take cues from \"Secret Stores\", a blissful track from You Today, McBride's otherwise disappointing solo effort as Martial Canterel from earlier this year. There's more intricacy, more gloriously tangled arpeggios, and a stronger focus overall on melodic composition. That last one is key, as it also Wendelbo and McBride have also developed stronger vocal presences. Wendelbo no longer sounds like she's simply sighing into an amplifier, while McBride's range has expanded and now runs from the gothic sighs on the lovely opening title track to fierce determinism on \"Corrupt\", an aggro headblast of a number that should satisfy fans of the latest Cold Cave album. Sets & Lights is also the first release from Xeno & Oaklander where they reveal that they have a sense of humor one of the digitalonly bonus tracks is a fouralarm Italo disco assault called \"Italy\". But Sets & Lights, like earlier records, is ultimately a bit too stuffy and selfserious as a whole. Still, while this collection may not be a breakout release, it's good to hear them stepping out and experimenting with new moods and textures. "}
