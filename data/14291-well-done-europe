And over their sevenyear existence, London pranksters the Chap have taken a considerable amount of glee in skewering social mores and aspirational affluence, with a manic, metapop approach that doesn't so much plant tongue in cheek as pierce it right through. But like the satirical UK periodical for which they're named, behind the Chap's broadly sardonic front lies a sincere hope for a better, more humane way of living. On album number five, Well Done Europe, the Chap continue their mission of mocking the finer things in life, but also zero in on the suppressed anxieties that go along with obtaining them. To that end, the Chap's ethos owes less to such esteemed class commentators as Ray Davies and Jarvis Cocker than to the likes of Kraftwerk and Steely Dan bands who observed highsociety behavior not from the sidelines, but within it. Like the Chap's previous albums, Well Done Europe frantically plunders myriad pop subgenres postpunk, 1980s New Pop, hard rock, electro, pastoral psychedelic folk, krautrock, Afrofunk, laptop glitchpop in a manner that reflects the ravenous consumerism and ratrace pressures detailed in its songs, complete with references to summer homes, frappuccinos, Shakira, whitewater rafting vacations, characters with uppercrusty names like Holden and especially onpoint in the wake of the Icelandicvolcano eruption the marvelous efficiency of European air travel.  But on Well Done Europe, there's a more palpable sense of the emotional void that no amount of luxury goods can fill where the nocturnal technopop of \"Few Horoscope\" leans heavily on the trusty old postpunk saw of portraying romance as a mechanical process (\"it's too late...to reboot/ The passion\"), the similarly austere \"Obviously\" effectively ruminates on the eternal question of modernday, computerworld  dependency, as two disconnected voices repeatedly ask, \"Is anybody still out there?\" And if songs like \"We'll See to Your Breakdown\" and \"Even Your Friend\" stay true to the band's openly scornful, hyperpop aesthetic, there's an insidious, understated allure to the bassthrobbed \"Well Done You\" and the shimmering jangle of \"Pain Fan\" seemingly designed to have the very middlemanagement types caricatured within tapping along on their Beemer steering wheels during the morning commute. On 2008's Mega Breakfast, the Chap cheekily declared their intent to make \"proper songs for real folk!\" Well Done Europe delivers a surprise punchline: they weren't joking. "}
