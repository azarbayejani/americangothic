{"label":" Universal Motown / GOOD / Dream On","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/14520/homepage_large.224b0b26.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"kiD CuDi","title":"Man on the Moon: The End of Day","text":" Kanye West's 808s and Heartbreak was undoubtedly a divisive record, but a rare one where it felt like both sides were essentially making the same argument: We care about it because it was made by Kanye West. It's a backhanded compliment, acknowledging that everything he does is a vital listen but also that it would be tougher to overlook the LP's glaring flaws had it come from someone who hadn't built up a decade of goodwill through his musical work and personal transparency. No wonder Kid Cudi threatened to retire before he even put out Man on the Moon: The End of Day his debut essentially exists because of a record that drew most of its power from a singular cult of personality, and that's a lot to live up to.Cudi cowrote several tracks on 808s (most notably guesting on \"Welcome to Heartbreak\"), and combined with hits in Drake's \"Best I Ever Had\" and Cudi's own \"Day 'N' Nite\", the commercial resiliency of that album proved that fad or not, this sadsack backpack stuff is here to stay. But whereas 808s was a record about a very public figure attempting a retreat he'd be incapable of sustaining, Man on the Moon uses quotidian, lonely stoner turmoil as a means of introduction.Now, I still check for Atmosphere projects and I've got a functioning knowledge of the Get Up Kids' discography, so I can't knock Man on the Moon for skewing emo. And we won't play the hipster card, since this record lives and dies by its lyrics as much as any document of spitthesebars formalism. The problem is how these two impulses feed off each other in all the wrong ways, with Cudi inverting the songwriting process so that a supposed pursuit of honesty is rendered predatory and manipulative. \"I got some issues that nobody can see,\" goes the hook to \"Soundtrack 2 My Life\", and it's a boast as grandiose as you're likely to hear in 2009. Throughout, Cudi's issues could not be rendered in a more clumsy or obvious way, blowing up every slight perceived or real (\"had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them\") into trials of such mythical proportions that it needs a bogus fourpart \"plot\" (Cudi is sad, does mushrooms, starts to get famous, is still sad) and narration from Common.Cudi also slathers his verses with a flat warble that AutoTune was made to salvage. It would be numbing enough on its own, but nearly every 30 seconds there's some terrifyingly underwritten lyric to jolt you into sharp pangs of embarrassment. He's referred to as \"our hero\" throughout Man on the Moon, and his superpower is managing to convey unlimited amounts of :( while staying firmly in his vocabstunted \"sorrow\"\"tomorrow\"/ \"room\"\"moon\" wheelhouse of rhymes. \"Look at me/ You tell me just what you see/ Am I someone whom you may love/ Or enemy,\" goes a particularly Brandon Flowerslike line of the otherwise effectively spare \"Mr. Solo Dolo (Nightmare)\". As far as rap metaphors go, Cudi is Katrina with no FEMA: \"I live in a cocoon/ Opposite of Cancun/ Where it is never sunny/ Dark side of the moon,\" or, even more pointedly, \"Gray clouds up above, man/ Metaphor to my life, man.\"But what's most frustrating of all is that Cudi can make Man on the Moon feel like a missed opportunity instead of a nonstarter. His hooks have a way of burrowing into your brain you already know the deal with \"Day 'N' Nite\", and \"Simple As...\" bears a strange resemblance to \"SemiCharmed Life\" but damn if I'll be able to forget it any time soon. He's also got a really keen ear for sounds: \"Mr. Solo Dolo\" nods to the warped Orientalism from Silent Shout's quieter tracks and you almost wish the tangible warmth emanating from the strings on \"In My Dreams\" would reveal itself in something other than a somnambulant intro. Cruelest of all, the album goes a long ways towards redeeming itself with its final two tracks \"Hyyerrr\" nods to the haziest productions from DJ UNeek while \"Up Up & Away\" unabashedly makes its altrock intentions known with jarringly optimistic acoustic guitars.It makes you think things could get better if Cudi manages to cheer up in the future (and why not? Man on the Moon is the rare record in 2009 that's beating sales expectations), but then we might just end up with more songs like \"Enter Galactic\" and \"Make Her Say\", the \"Poker Face\" remake where Cudi, 'Ye, and Common play misogynistically against type for laughs and somehow make you feel bad for Lady Gaga. Even with \"Stapleton Sex\" and \"Gihad\" making the rounds recently, it's probably still the most noxious sex rap I've managed to hear in some time.Cudi would like to think this record is criticproof, or at least that's what I cull from his decision to paraphrase the \"there will always be somebody who will shoot down any dream\" line from Kanye's \"Bring Me Down\". But that number up there isn't a judgment of Cudi's pain, as much as it is an ability to express it being misunderstood in the Midwest and lost in the big city will never fail to inspire phenomenal art in twentysomethings, but Cudi too often assumes some sort of higher ground even though his selfpity is flaunted no differently than any other tacky rapper accessory.
