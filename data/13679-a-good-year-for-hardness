{"label":" Anchor Brain","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/14708/homepage_large.e553ffd1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jason Crock","artist":"Six Finger Satellite","title":"A Good Year for Hardness","text":" A Good Year for Hardness doesn't sound like what you'd expect from Six Finger Satellite, but during the first 10 years of their career before their hiatus in 2001, they never really played to expectations anyway. From gnashing noiserock to synthheavy freakouts to Krautrock rhythms and electronic textures, the band never lingered on any particular style or sound for very long. Listeners and critics alike have compared them to Shellac, Devo, Braniac, even Kraftwerk a pretty disparate group of pretty innovative bands. Even the album they recorded before breaking up, the traightforward hardcore Half Control (which only saw release last year), was another relative left turn. But throughout all the personnel changes and stylistic shifts, the band was never dull. Until now.Singer J. Ryan and drummerturnedguitarist Rick Pelletier are the only founding members left, joined here by Dan St. Jaques and Brian Dufresne on bass and drums. \"Hot Food\" starts the record on a reassuring note, with biting and saturated guitars, backup vocals rearranged until they sound like gargling robots, and a short, spooky Moog. The repetitive riff and callandresponse of following track \"Roam From Home\", however, are more indicative of the rest of the record.  Almost all the songs are recorded with monotonous bottomstring guitar riffs and lurching, staccato rhythms. In their swagger and bluster, most of these songs have a surprisingly classic rock feel. (Ryan goes so far as to quote \"Come Together\" on \"Half Life\" and \"Macarthur Park\" on \"Midnight Rails\".) As for any electronic textures, there are few synthesizers in earshot, save for the aforementioned \"Hot Food\" and the occasional lowinthemix accoutrement on \"Half Life\" or \"Hearts and Rocks\". \"Wilson P.\" adds a glassier, more distinctive guitar riff along with some organ for some needed variety, and the hushed patter of \"Rise\", the closing track, is the record's most intense moment. However, the songs fail to distinguish themselves from one another and bleed into one lumbering, forgettable whole.That said, the band sounds excited to be back together. The austere production catches an undeniable energy, and although their lyrics are a little less manic in their delivery, they're still sung with convincing menace. Holding them to their past glory may not be fair, but before their hiatus, they were a forwardthinking and creatively restless band. If there's any standard they should be held to, it's that. Given that the band has been touring, there still may be bolder efforts ahead. "}
