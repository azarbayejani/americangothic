It's hard for a band that operates on their level semiprominent in certain circles with the odd stab of almostfame here and there, such as when they opened for Tool to keep people interested for that long. They seemed sort of on their way in the late 1990s, when they were at their peak, making records that in hindsight anticipated some of the trends of the following decade at the crossroads of rock and electronic music. A couple of substandard albums in the early to mid00s seemed to kill their momentum, but 2007's Sex Change was a strong return to form, and now we have the band's ninth proper album, Thing, which isn't quite as solid as its predecessor but still plays to the band's strengths.They've backed off the very upfront and straight vocals that helped Sex Change sound so fresh for them on the only two tracks with vocals, Means hides inside a vocoder cocoon that works well but still feels like a retreat to their comfort zone, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. So you get your scifi postrock like \"Space Dock\", which would fit neatly on the Tron soundtrack, and \"Naked Singularity\", which is like the \"Knight Rider\" theme turned inside out and remixed with heavy metal drums.For a band that never seemed to take itself all that seriously, the aesthetic decisions Trans Am made ages ago fit with remarkably well with what's going on in music now. The nods to funk, the krautrock rhythms, the hints of electro, the occasional glitch in the beat all are just part of indie rock these days. There are times when Trans Am does it better than anyone fractured and funky \"Arcadia\", with its storm of delayed guitar set against lockedin drums and sequencer, is a good example, while \"Interstellar Drift\" does something similar, only with an insistent motorik bass and drum pulse.And so Trans Am are in an odd place. The band is the oblivious kid that that never paid attention to fashion who suddenly finds that the look he's always had is cool. They still gets bogged down in places, padding the album with gonowhere interludes and a sixminute centerpiece that's mostly too chaotic to make any impact, but on the album's best tracks, it's great to hear them again, doing what they do best.
