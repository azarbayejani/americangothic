The album opens with a brief honkytonkin' interlude and \"Lux and Royal Shopper\", which adds some crunch to a cluttered, Rouge Waveesque modern take on folk. \"Love I Exclaim!\" puts anemic goodtime country over funky breakbeats, and is one of the album's most ingratiating moments, but the early peak is the gentle, spacedout ballad \"Summer Twin\". That track leaps into the aptly selfdescribed \"freakpop\" on its chorus, which is all referee whistles and chickenscratch guitars. Several different musical elements howling rock, acoustic plucking, electronic percussion, harpsichord pop in and out of its simple melodies, but the lofi production lends it a sonic cohesion. On the record's second half, the songs become more traditional and their arrangements more homogenous, but they're just as worthwhile. \"Concrete Heaven\" is equal parts Willie Nelson and the shambling folk experiments of Beck's One Foot in the Grave, its lyrics alternating between evocative and goofy (from \"Paper cups and cigarette butts left in the sink\" to \"I'm still walkin' around in rainbowcolored thongs\"). They play the wideeyed AM pop of \"Asleep for Days\" comfortably and convincingly, and the chorus of \"40 Stripes\" recalls CSN&Y.  \"Dirty Pearls\" is a speedy, competent bluegrass number, but the last few songs lack the strong melodies and quirk of the bulk of the album. Quirkiness isn't the main selling point of Field Rexx, however it simply has a healthy sense of variation. There's a lot of disparate, whimsical sonic elements in the disc's earlier songs, and they're tastefully incorporated, but most of the memorable twists and turns are provided the oldfashioned way, like the subtle guitar lead in \"Summer Twin\". On Field Rexx, Blitzen Trapper may not take the same chances as other genrebending artists, but nor do they strive to. It simply (and successfully) aims a backporch country/folk album for leftofthedial tastes.  Â   "}
