{"label":" Modular","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/12994/homepage_large.e3c41af6.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Mike Orme","artist":"Ladyhawke","title":"Ladyhawke","text":" Ladyhawke's eponymous fulllength, on which \"Paris Is Burning\" appears, has so far been met with relative apathy in the States. Part of the problem might be that no one really knows what to make of her. The ersatz 1980s influences she fronts on \"Back of the Van\" and \"Oh My\" gyrate confusingly between the appropriated, clubby electropop of Cut Copy and the more MOR side of Stevie Nicks. Brown's bipolar moods occasionally dilute her wellcrafted anthems. The result is a complicated message that offers glitzy choruses and pinpoint synthesizer strikes, but also imbues in her an Everywoman's humility and hope.But Ladyhawke carries on, whizzing by like a flipbook of classic concepts: quirky and synthesized sheen from Cyndi Lauper, feminist rocker mystique from Nicks. At her best, Pip Brown sounds like she wrote the damn book herself: \"Back of the Van\" could have headlined the soundtrack to the great neverfilmed Goonies sequel, worthy at least for the relentless \"You set me on/ You set me on fire!\" chorus. The Numan \"Cars\" rip in \"Paris Is Burning\" adorns a kaleidoscopic junk pile of skittering drums, piano stabs, and palmmuted guitar. It seems that for almost every retread like \"Love Don't Live Here\" or \"Crazy World\", there's at least a lining of forward thinking. Take the percussive \"Dusk Till Dawn\", which marches along to the beat of both the urban white chic of Gwen Stefani and the cokenosed disco rock of Franz Ferdinand. Hands down, the best moment on the record comes with the bassdrum punctuation to Brown's \"Bang bang bang/ On the wall\" mantra. To wit: some filler, some Thriller.In more ways than one, the images communicate the content. On Ladyhawke's cover illustration, Brown kneels halfclothed in a messy rumpus room, Famicom controllers and Casios strewn about the floor, Zapper gun stuck in her belt, her gaze intently fixed upon an offcanvas television. Flanked by her pet cats, Pip Brown affects the image of an Internet Age spinster, clinging to remembrances of videogame antiquity. And so it is with the music: Ladyhawke is brimming with ideas whose worst moments quantify this past and whose best build upon it. "}
