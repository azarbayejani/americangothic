{"label":" Drag City","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13171/homepage_large.5741335c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Johnny Loftus","artist":"The Fucking Am","title":"Gold","text":" Upon its release in 2001, many indie rock policy wonks noted that \"The Fucking Am\" would've been a better moniker for a Fucking Champs/Trans Am collaboration than the trucking companyesque handle \"Trans Champs\" that graced the cover of their Double Exposure. Ever the quirky appeasers, the gentlemen of The Fucking Champs and Trans Am have united once again, this time under this improved banner. The name is not only a boon to the asterisk industry, but also tunes in to just what the new group's doing. The Champs have always been enamored of chunkheaded metal and mono 70s handlebarrock, while Trans Am have recast decades past mostly through an ironic/robotic tonic of tape backup drives and synthesizers and when combined, the two groups find an unusually evenly proportioned middle ground. In other words, everyone can relax a little and stop trying to recharge intellectualism via the instrumental form. Gold gives Trans Am a chance to veer away from the shrillness of their recent work, while the Champs don't ride as high on the harmonized guitar hog. And both groups contribute to a wash of accompanying atmospherics that suggests their respective allegiances to electronically created music. Opener \"Bad Leg\"'s lurching, stopping, and starting percussion feels like the doing of the Am, while its soaring guitar line is all Champs. And how about that midsong break into buzzing Pink Floyd keyboard fluff? With two bands' worth of personnel, it's easy for The Fucking Am to fill out the metallic/melodic collagism that typifies types like Death From Above 1979 or the louder parts of Eagles of Death Metal, and \"Leg\" is a great example of this. The subsequent \"Gauntlet\" isn't as strong particularly its heavily treated, heavyhanded vocals make for an awfully weak pun. That said, a loop of its phaseshifting drum fill intro and strutting main riff would still keep a loft of 80s fetishists partying at right angles for an entire week.Gold's midsection again points to its casual amiability. Starting with a melody inspired by the softrock saccharine croon of Orleans' \"Still the One\", \"Doing Research for an Autobiography\" shambles into a series of descending \"Foreplay/Long Time\" organ solos, and has an endearingly liverecorded quality. And \"Taking Liberties\" chucks the instrumental format for a boozy, dangling cigarette backup to the chestbeating guest vocal of Jillian Iva. The Fucking Am then heightens the microprog arc of Double Exposure's \"First Comes Sunday Morning\" and \"Then Comes Saturday Night\", offering a threeway albumclosing tribute to hazy seventies sunlight in \"Acoustico Gomez\", \"Elastico Gomez\", and \"Electrico Gomez\". The first is led by its gently plucked lead into a fog glimmering keyboards and evocative Vangelis soft focus, while \"Elastico\" is the album's drug rock cocktail, a mess of backwards guitar solos and desert heat drones. The subsequent \"Electrico\" skyrockets Gold's Me Decade muse to a feelgood pinnacle with two guitars dueling and a consistent build. It's like an ode to the art of Boris Vallejo. Subtlety can prove elusive for instrumental rockers, just as identifying them as such gets pretty redundant. Their lack of vocals somehow seems to qualify them for press that expects something very serious, or at least intellectual. From Fbombed monikers to looselimbed referential jams, Gold lets The Fucking Champs and Trans Am get conjunctional, and focus on making music instead of upholding a concept. "}
