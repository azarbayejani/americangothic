{"label":" XL","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/12194/homepage_large.340487c4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Cajun Dance Party","title":"The Colourful Life","text":" Bernard Butler produced the Libertines' first single, \"What a Waster\". Six years later, the former Suede guitarist and cosongwriter has become a producer of choice for aspiring NME pinups. Butler totally deserves his status as Britpop legend, but his recent reemergence was anything but preordained. Aside from his shortlived 2005 reunion with Brett Anderson as the Tears, Butler's postSuede output has tended to be, at best, unexceptional. His production credits including the 1990s' Cookies, Sons & Daughters' This Gift, and the Veils' Runaway Found, but also Black Kids' Partie Traumatic and Duffy's Rockferry have been similarly scattershot.Black Kids have a handful of good songs, all of which sound simply inept rather than charming on the album. London fivepiece Cajun Dance Party are better off they only have one good one! And it's better suited to the sort of rollicking, punchedup production Butler gave the Libs or the 1990s. Cajun Dance Party released first single \"The Next Untouchable\" last year, when the group's members were all younger than 18; the song's snakelike guitar riff combines with Daniel Blumberg's pinched, impassioned cries to overcome unremarkable boygirl lyrics (\"Do you really like me?/ 'Cause 1 and 1 and 1 makes 3\"). Another jittery postSupergrass rocker, it loses less than \"I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance With You\" when Butler polishes off the appealingly rough edges.The rest of The Colourful Life is, ahem, less colorful. Most of the blame shouldn't go to Butler, but to these notsoragin' nonCajuns. There are many reasons critics tend to adore the Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner, and one is that he doesn't write songs like this album's sunny opener (and second single), \"Colourful Life\", which cautions, \"Don't crush the bird just for fun/ Because that's not fun for everyone.\" Another single, \"The Race\", exerts a great deal of Arcticslike energy answering an ageold question: If the sun rises and no one's around, does it still rise? (Um, yes.) And Blumberg's breathy whispertoshout antics quickly grow old, particularly on the \"Creep\"aping coda of \"Buttercups\" or the empty, Travislike melodrama of \"Time Falls\", which fails despite mentioning a wildebeest.Not that Butler completely evades responsibility. The sentimental strings draping \"Yesterday\"style ballad \"No Joanna\" don't make up for its fundamental silliness and ethereal moaning that must have Jeff Buckley rolling in his (watery?) grave. Nor do they help second single \"Amylase\", which opens with a suspiciously Go! Team or Black Kidslike group chant of \"1, 2 1, 2, 3, 4!\", has big bendy Oasis guitar bits, and is disappointingly nothing like \"Animal Nitrate\". That's from Suede, dudes.This slight album's ninth and final track, \"The Hill, the View, and the Lights\", is pleasant but befuddling, with keyboardist Vicky Freund briefly turning things into a Neko Case gothic fairytale as she gets her first turn on lead vocal. Earlier, within dud \"The Firework\", Blumberg sings, \"This is now and that was then,\" a clich√© that means no more on The Colourful Life than it does here. One thing Cajun Dance Party's future selves have going for them, though: They aren't called Beirut. "}
