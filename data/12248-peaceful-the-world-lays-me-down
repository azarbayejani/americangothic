Movies, I mean. Six months go by between trips to the multiplex. If Netflix still turns a profit after recent financial events, it'll be because of two DVDs my wife and I have been meaning to send back (unseen) since, ohh, August. So in other words, those early Wes Anderson flicks are still pretty huge for me, even as a divided pop culture has helped bigbudget schlock conquer actual film snobs. Anderson and many effective fey indiepoppers have real similarities: obsessive detail, pitchperfect verbiage, outlandish characters, bookish humor, Harold and Mauderetro aesthetic, supersized cult followings. No surprise, then that Noah and the Whale take their name from director Noah Baumbach and his Andersonproduced The Squid and the Whale.Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down, the debut LP by the London folkpop quartet, bites its best sensitiveindie forebears and then pukes up all the most superficial chunks. You've got your boygirl harmonies: Charlie Fink sounds like a UK Jens Lekman covering Pedro the Lion; Laura Marling is more Amelia Fletcher. You've got your quirky, mostly sprightly arrangements: acoustic guitar, ukulele, banjo, glockenspiel, handclaps, fingersnaps, strings, horns, eccentric percussion... the full Sufjan Stevens. You've also got your trite generalities, ridiculous philosophical musings, utterly banal narrator, and, most damningly, no recognizable sense. of. humor. at. all. This is twee pop you might order in a kit, ask Dad to put together, and then leave on a shelf for the dust to cover up (the sooner the better).I'd have to be getting reeducated Clockwork Orangestyle or else a paid album reviewer even to listen past sunnily bababaing opener \"2 Atoms in a Molecule\", which is to the concept of metaphor what the 1980s Tampa Bay Buccaneers were to the concept of pro football: \"If love is just a game, then how come it's no fun?/ If love is just a game, how come I've never won?\" But still we press on, only to hear the similarly tweebynumbers \"Jocasta\" fill spaces with the word \"oh\" the way us inarticulate GenYers tend to say \"like\" or \"you know.\" Timpanirumbling \"Do What You Do\" and pianobacked \"Give a Little Love\" offer practical advice, generally of the \"Do what you do\" or \"All is fleeting/ Yeah, but all is good\" sort. By the time the whistling starts over \"Brimful of Asha\" chords on highestcharting single \"5 Years Time\" (\"Sun, sun, sun!\" \"Fun, fun, fun!\" \"Love, love, love!\"), smoking \"stupid little cigarettes\" and drinking a few boxes of \"stupid wine\" oh, respite and nepenthe! sounds like the secondbest activity to stupid little murdersuicide. \"We're all just matter that will one day scatter,\" Fink points out on the slowmotion, Fbombing title track. It's all ample grist for Noah and the Whale II: Vote for Pedro. "}
