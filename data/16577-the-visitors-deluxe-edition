The Swedish pop goliaths have been quietly protective of their legacy over the last three decades no reunions and tight archival control so the new song made headlines. Would \"From a Twinkling Star to a Passing Angel\" be an unreleased gem or a justly forgotten offcut?  Actually, it's neither; instead, it's a good argument as to why exactly there's nothing left in the vaults. The tweeest title in ABBA's, and possibly pop's history, hides a fascinating, carefully arranged montage showing the group's craftsmanlike side. They take album closer \"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\" from its birth as a rearrangement of \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" to its release as a twilit meditation on mortality. None of the many versions disco, nursery rhyme, stringsattached are as good as the final release. The medley seems designed to show both ABBA's punctilious approach to getting a track right, and their good judgement in knowing when they'd managed it. Even as the band's commercial star faded and its professional relationships quietly unravelled, they were perfectionists. ABBA's music on The Visitors is more pristine and ambitious than it had ever been, its themes darker, its personal politics more tangled. Both of the band's couples had divorced, but the men were still writing lyrics for the women to sing meaning it's easy to see a cruel edge in tracks like \"One of Us\", in which a woman regrets her new independence over a typically gorgeous melody. All of this has made The Visitors a perennial critic's favorite. It's the record on which the wintry melancholy of \"late ABBA\" whose sadness had bubbled under their music almost from the start could finally dominate. But things are never quite so simple. The original nine tracks that make up The Visitors are no less uneven than any ABBA fulllength; in fact, the weakest songs are a snapshot of their foibles as a group. They had a long dalliance with musical theatre the pomppop fantasia \"I Let the Music Speak\" is their last and most bloated attempt. \"Two for the Price of One\" a hokey story of a failed threesome calls back to their earliest, goofiest records. \"Slipping Through My Fingers\", about the impotence of watching your kids grow up, is a great example of how the group had come to pitch records at adults, but in execution it's pure schmaltz. The highs, though, are astonishing. The title track is a snapshot of life in a totalitarian state, full of justified paranoia and exhausted fatalism: \"I hear the doorbell ring\" it begins matteroffactly \"and suddenly the panic takes me.\" The music lurches between seasick synthpop and nervous disco flourishes, with Frida Lyngstad's ragainfuenced vocals rolling uneasily on top. It's five years and a musical lifetime since this band sung \"Dum Dum Diddle\", but for all its distance from ABBA's traditional sound, \"The Visitors\" never gives up on catchiness. This is grownup, risktaking pop, but always pop nonetheless.  The same goes for the record's other strong songs the ghostly \"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\", the cryptic \"Soldiers\", the wise and sympathetic \"When All Is Said and Done\". Aurally, too, the group was never better: The Visitors is deliciously crisp, layered, and rewarding where a lot of contemporary synthpop now sounds rather thin. Some of the band's latterday weaknesses have been ironed out their rather awkward relationship with disco, for instance. Their \"disco LP,\" VoulezVous, was marked by a noticeable stiffness: By the time of The Visitors ABBA hadn't got any funkier, but they had learned to use their unyielding rhythms creatively, turning their dancepop into something intriguingly angular and staccato on \"I Am the City\" and \"You Owe Me One\". Those songs are both included on the reissue as bonus tracks indeed The Visitors' set of bonus material is uniformly terrific, turning a fine album into a great one. \"Cassandra\", like \"The Visitors\", is a cryptic sketch of unspecified political disaster, given devastating dignity by Frida's measured vocals. \"Under Attack\" and \"I Am the City\" are clockwork jewel boxes of hooks. \"Should I Laugh or Cry\", a puncturing of a pompous husband and dead marriage, takes all the spite of their famous divorce songs and turns it back on the men to wounding effect. And leaving out \"From a Twinkling Star\"'s exercise in archaeology The Visitors ends with career highlight \"The Day Before You Came\", Agnetha singing a woman's hesitant reconstruction of the day before she met someone we assume is her lover. The details are banal, but Agnetha makes them live anyway, and they're contrasted by keening backing vocals of such dread that it's been speculated the song's \"You\" is killer, not partner. \"The Day Before You Came\" is, on paper, a happier song than \"The Visitors\", but it shares its themes with much of the album: Life is unstable, happiness may be fleeting, and your world can be instantly and forever overturned. These are strong, resonant ideas to end a career on, and this is an excellent way to finish a band and a record divided between almost throwaway studio mastery and spectral, uneasy premonitions of their own demise.
