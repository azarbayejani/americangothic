Janes can sing pretty well, and she writes decent enough songs, but she knows both of these things, and Poison & Snakes sounds a little too house proud. Technically, the album's \"about\" the American West, and Janes' country doowop twang complements her more relaxed loveydovey numbers nicely enough, as on the letyoudowneasy lullaby \"Wonderkiller\", the potsypanny, sometimes throaty \"Deep Sea Diver\", and the album's title track, for which Fifel Goes West And Plays The Album's Token Harmonica Solo. Elsewhere, I don't know, it's all just too much. Janes goes for bonsai countrified punk on \"Streetlight\", but the whole thing comes out sounding like a Burger King commercial. \"Sets To Cleaning\" is unhinged and rickety, but not without the drummer's most transparent efforts to sound like he's completely autistic. The canned pianoandkiddievox opener of \"Desert\" kicks up just enough postrock dirt for the noodling to hit the sevenminute mark, but by the end the song still has nothing to say for itself. \"Go Between\" also sounds like a Burger King commercial, but in fairness, there are some scenes from Dances With Wolves it reminds me of as well. I try not to get wrapped up in the folk authenticity or \"Who's faking the folk?\" debates about tradition, eclecticism, and so forth. Really, my biggest concern is whether an album makes me feel old, and this one definitely does. Poison & Snakes is quality but adultcontemporary, a fine piece of Waterford crystal or Cat's Meow memorabilia that I can't yet appreciate if I'll ever want to. "}
