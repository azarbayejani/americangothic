{"label":" Hyperdub","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/14632/homepage_large.6dfa66ed.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nate Patrin","artist":"King Midas Sound","title":"Waiting For You","text":" The Bug's London Zoo aged well over the past year: It still stands as one of the more exciting albums of 2008, a rootsheavy dubstep/dancehall crossover with ribcracking rhythms and an amazing guest roster of singers and toasters that stands as a remarkably distinctive collection of voices. But there was a surprise harbinger in that album, a song that my original review actually completely overlooked due to or maybe despite a strippeddown, ambient eeriness that offset the rest of the album's aggrobeat feel. That song was \"You & Me\", a strikingly delicate yet powerful collaboration with the softvoiced singer/poet Roger Robinson. And about three months after London Zoo dropped, the creative partnership of Robinson and producer Kevin Martin brought forth a deservedly lauded single under the name King Midas Sound: the ghostly \"Cool Out\", which rivaled the best of Burial when it came to the more desolate corners of dubstep.One year later, \"Cool Out\" has reemerged as the lead track off the first King Midas Sound fulllength, and it's retained its impact assuming you can refer to the feeling of becoming slowly enveloped in abandonedhighrise ambiance and serenaded by quivering, sweetly voiced murmurs as an impact. It also stands as one of the highlights of Waiting for You, or at least one of the most chilling moments; the fact that this album can conflate the two is a sure sign of where it's coming from. Every strength this record holds draws off the symbiotic relationship between Martin's beats and Robinson's voice, which adapt to each other in a way that the last two people in a barren environment might. This is dub production rendered as the final reverberations of a deserted cityscape, infused with a crumbling lowend that does for bass what a single fluorescent tube in an underground concrete tunnel does for light. And the voice decorates it like a spiderweb fragile in appearance, but structurally resilient enough to hold strong against the rhythm.Robinson's singing sells his idea of zerogravity lovers' rock like a champ, filling in the evocative cracks that his mostly straightforward lyrics don't do much to cover. The title track's lovesick sentiments are familiar, but there's this pang to his voice a bit disbelieving, bitter, hopeful and agonized all at once that holds the deeper meaning. And he's just as powerful on the other songs where he's called upon to invoke that lonely brooding atmosphere \"One Ting\" (sonically bleaker than the nanoorchestral lavishness of Dabrye's remix from the \"Cool Out\" 12\"); the mistyeyed takemeback begging of \"Darlin'\"; \"Meltdown\" and its heavysighing pleads for intimacy. Robinson does have an intriguing vocal counterpart on a few tracks in the person of Dokkeki Q member Kiki Hitomi, at her ethereally malicious best on \"Goodbye Girl\" delivering spiteful reprimands and Elvis Costello quotes with a scalpel's agility (\"I wish you pain 'til you can't ever feel joy/ I wish you luck with a capital F, boy\"). But the more remote and abandoned Robinson's aching voice sounds, the heavier it hits.Not all of Waiting for You has that same ambiance, though it rarely rises above the level of a soft rumble. Martin's production forgoes the stereotypical dubstep war of bassbin attrition to let the beats glow instead of flash, and even when it approaches an actual heavy knock like the underwater dancehall bump of \"Outta Space\" or the smothered Mantronix boomclap of \"I Man\" it still resembles the starker moments of Mezzanineera Massive Attack more than it does something along the lines of Bug tracks like \"Skeng\" or \"Warning\". Still, a little something is lost when things digress from the cutting isolation that made \"Cool Out\" work, especially when Robinson breaks from his singing to issue scoffing spokenword holistic reprimands on \"Earth a Kill Ya\" a decent bit of preaching with a heavy scowl of a beat beneath, but oddly harsh and selfassured on a record that thrives on sounding vulnerable.
