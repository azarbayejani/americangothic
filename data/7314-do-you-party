N I P K (truth)  L4D135 + ge(nder nonspecific)nts: You shan't be disappointed in Wednesday evening's corral of events, featuring The Western cutup Mr. Drew Daniel! Providing live deviancy via a slew of unrelated sexual incidents (aka the! finest! in! bassdominated! entertainment!), tonight's master of ceremonies is prepared to offer you an incredible display of haute panache and dddisco flash. Fresh from a storied career as onehalf of San Francisco's dashing elektronik outfit Matmos who themselves have delivered three longform eclectic fineries of their own, e'en working with an Icelandic butterbird of some kind Mr. D. has trimmed the fat and now ventures beyond the mundane and into our house. The Soft Pink Truth has already presented the world with two 12inch samples of his manhood on the esteemed Matthew Herbert's Soundslike imprint, but Do You Party? is his first fulllength outing. For the project, he's dragged along bongos from Matpal Martin Schmidt and the vox stylings of Blevin Blechdom. But rest assured, this is not \"intelligent\" dance music, nor is it a simple technological experiment it is truly a declaration of penetration, a celebration of gender confusion and ONE RED HOT JAM.Do You Party? is an allages event, but attire is strictly adult (girls: that means no dresses). Minidisco at one moment, electroshocking the next, this party engorges the senses with only the Holiest fouronthefloor. It is explicitly prohibited to remain still, and we are not \"Soft on Crime\". (4warning: Some moments may contain high percentages of European microhousing, especially ones that reference dead French composers.) (2x4warning: Others don't.) Admission is absolutely nothing for: Girls, girls, girls, girls, women, yo ladies, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, women (I always thought that I knew), all the ladies across the globe, girls, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, girls, girls, (big booty) butt (bitches), Miss E., and anyone who wishes they were a lady. Check the guestlist if you have heretofore accepted [BOOTY] as your savior. There will be oldguard analog synths, a million and three onesecond vocalists distilled to their most soulful essences, BASS, tastefully updated mutations of disco, ritualistic orgiastic ceremonies (time permitting), \"a devastatingly funky house rhythm\" and \"staggering compositional talent and sampling virtuosity of the highest order.\" Strike a pose, there's nothing to it. The particulars, then Time: Soon Place: SF/Detroit/KÃ¶ln Girls: Ladies Make Up: Lipstick, eyeliner, green, blue, comb hair, I WANNA MAKE IT GOOD 4 U Smoking: \"I'm not ready yet\" Dancing: You're wasting your time if you play this while sitting down.
