It's true in multiple senses of the word much of their work is concerned with physical coupling or the pain derived from the lack thereof, and even when shooting for hacklesraising anthems, they're never playing for the cheap seats. Grand as they were, \"The Modern Leper\", \"I Feel Better\", and \"Skip the Youth\" still came off like an animated barfly keeping the regulars enrapt with their latest tale of romantic futility. But when thinking about their superficially pleasing qualities Scott Hutchison's handsomely burred vocals, their scrappy acoustic interplay, and unapologetically heartsick emoting you start to wonder if there's any reason that couldn't be as popular as softbatch, StayPuft stadium filling like Snow Patrol or Mumford & Sons. Should they be as popular? The Glaswegian band is signed to Atlantic now, and the State Hospital EP is a strange experiment in this context, never too far from what you might expect from the band, yet presented in an emotionally and sonically cohesive way that makes the songs here come off as unnecessarily simplified. It would be easy enough to attribute that to the rich, luxurious production of State Hospital, but The Winter of Mixed Drinks was a pretty glossy album, even if it couldn't completely suffuse the activity of Frightened Rabbit's musicianship. State Hospital continues the trend of redistributing the depth of the rhythm section on The Midnight Organ Fight to everywhere else and often it detracts from their more immediate talents Grant Hutchison's stickbreaking drumwork, the nimble guitarpicking of his brother Scott and Andy Monaghan. This stuff is easypaced, pure hangover balm, in the mode of \"Poke\" or \"Good Arms vs. Bad Arms\".  While State Hospital lacks for pure visceral pleasure, Hutchison can still convey such a deep, muscular ache in his vocals, indicating that Frightened Rabbit still know their strengths. The title track is a rare example of Hutchison writing about a lack of fulfillment from the other side of the sexual divide and problems that go deeper than an inability to get one's rocks off in this case, presumably a girl born into poverty with the attendant pall of domestic abuse, emotional detachment, ineffective schooling, and the lack of expectations thereof. Her skin and blood are \"thicker than concrete,\" and as \"State Hospital\" wells up, the indignities do as well the death blow occurs as Hutchison reveals her fate \"to keep warm the arms of a plumber/ Bloody and balding/ Who just needs a spine to dig into/ Just for the head and a hand for the holding.\" By \"Boxing Night\", Hutchison is back playing the victim as hihats and backup vocals jangle nervously, finding the hopelessly lovesick narrator \"at home/ With a drink to ill health/ Just me and these walls and a beaten up chair.\" In a previous live version of \"Boxing Night\", he was \"drinking to death.\" It's an auspicious start to State Hospital even if it doesn't display how Hutchison can turn some less admirable human qualities bitterness, sarcasm, alcoholism into endearing and often funny little songs. The only humor on State Hospital is supplied by Aidan Moffatt's stein/torchpassing guest spot on \"Wedding Gloves\" (\"A melting of morals/ A solder of souls/ As sexy as lace/ But with just as much holes\"). This is Frightened Rabbit sounding as emotionally meek and needy as their name might suggest, which gets a bit grating towards State Hospital's back half, where it gets hitched to some worryingly perfunctory songwriting. Frightened Rabbit have always had a thing for big, soppy metaphors the biblical selfloathing of \"The Modern Leper\", baptismal rebirth on \"Swim Until You Can't See Land\". They weren't necessarily clever, but Frightened Rabbit made those their own through sheer commitment. Too much of State Hospital feels like songwriting exercises on loan, asking to borrow a feeling. \"I might never be normal again\" is the climactic admission in \"Home From War\", and it's not enough of a payoff to endure the latest tour of duty in \"Love Is a Battlefield\". Meanwhile, \"Off\" finds Frightened Rabbit stealing from their own supply \"Off\" is nearly the exact same song as The Midnight Organ Fight's \"Old Old Fashioned\", stripped of its spirited folkrock stomping and charming specificities. Title aside, The Winter of Mixed Drinks gave us the indication that being perpetually soused and sexstarved was starting to wear on Frightened Rabbit as artists and people Hutchison admitted that he couldn't make another \"breakup record\" after The Midnight Organ Fight, one of the finest of recent vintage. But did opening for Death Cab For Cutie teach them the lay of the land? Let's not forget that band's Atlantic debut (and bestselling record) was the aching, insular and glassy Plans. Whether Hospital finds them following the same path, at least for now it indicates the triumphs of \"Living in Colour\" were shortlived, or at least strangely illfitting for Frightened Rabbit's next, and likely less intimate phase.
