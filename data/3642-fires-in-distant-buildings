{"label":" Warp","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/3606/homepage_large.33e34bb9.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jason Crock","artist":"Gravenhurst","title":"Fires in Distant Buildings","text":" Hidden amongst the largely electronic Warp Records stable, Gravenhurst have recorded two albums of hushed folk; on their third album, Fires in Distant Buildings, they take a bold step forward. Opener \"Down River\" sounds different from the off, with pronounced drums and an ominous lowend, a minimal, slowly unfolding riff, and few words getting in the way of its distorted climax. \"Velvet Cell\" is the biggest digression, a sleek Interpol clone with quick, clean downstrokes, Talbot's voice clear and plaintive while introducing the album's macabre preoccupations: \"To understand a killer/ I must become a killer/ Now I've tasted hatred, I want more.\" \"Animals\" holds back musically but keeps the dark streak lyrically, a quiet strum of clean guitars, hushed cymbal crashes, and pale organ, not to mention a killer opening line: \"They descend upon the city like flies/ Spring their eggs into a dead dog's eyes/ It's England on a Saturday night.\" Suicidal laments and a blues guitar solo follow. Eventually Gravehurst return to their comfort zone, offering the heartstopping acoustic waltz \"Nicole\" and \"Cities Beneath the Sea\", a gothictinged seashanty with an oddly cheerful bass part and droning church organs. \"Songs From Under the Arches\" further explores the band's postrock influence over 10 minutes of protracted morbidness, and the record closes with a cover of the Kinks' \"See My Friends\", which is given leaden underwater atmosphere that devolves into a loose jam session.  Talbot's voice keeps me back from total immersion in the album's dark source material. Sure, lowkey villains can be plenty creepy, and there's something to be said for juxtaposition, but not a shred of angst or aggression ever enters Talbot's voice. It all just seems so pleasant. Fires in Distant Buildings bears the calling cards of previous Gravenhurst albums the chilly atmosphere, the detached vocals, the attention to detail both instrumentally and lyrically but there's much emphasis given to new sounds that are wellexecuted but clearly indebted to other artists, and the murder ballads feel forced with Tobias' squeakyclean delivery. The expansion of their sound is refreshing, and the subject matter lends the record a dark singularity, but Fires in Distant Buildings feels more like a transitional album than anything else. "}
