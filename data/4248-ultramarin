It's incredible to contemplate the variety of emotional reactions possible from nothing more than a 4/4 bass drum, bits of percussive static, and a vague ghost of a melody. Tracks by the likes of Sutekh and Plastikman seem very cold and foreboding to me, suggesting something about the nature of man and machine, and the bleak future in store where the twain do meet. And then there's music made with similar tools by Jan Jelinek (under his own name and as Gramm) and Wolfgang Voigt's Gas releases, music that's warm, organic and expansive, suggesting a cheerful fusion of carbonbased life and silicon. Jetone (Montrealbased Tim Hecker) belongs in the latter category. His tracks are anchored by a bass thump with vast space moving between the sounds, but the slight textures he does incorporate lend the music a cozy and intimate feel. Extreme dub effects in minimal techno can give the illusion of music echoing through an empty concrete structure, but the reverb in Jetone is subtle and gentle, decaying slowly through a soft, welcoming space. \"Phoedra IV\" recalls the frayed loveliness of early Mouse on Mars, in particular Vulvaland's \"Chagrin,\" with its heartbeat pulse, clumps of sonic fuzz, and soothing keyboard drone. Enriching the stew is the slightly psychedelic nature of the sound sources, with portions of \"Phoedra IV\" recalling the drift of EAR's \"Space Themes.\" The repeating glitches that sit in the foreground of \"Mtl Bass\" seem related to the guitar refrain that opened Fennesz's Endless Summer, but with an insistent bass pulse pushing the tune away from more abstract realms. And \"Octan\" ups the grooviness factor with some playful electro squelches in the background, coming off as a more austere Two Lone Swordsmen. Throughout most of Ultramarin, Jetone clings to the relaxed 4/4 beat like a tattered shred of a favorite blanket, using the familiar rhythm to bind the unfamiliar and varied sound sources. But a handful of tracks jettison the grid and nestle into pure ambient territory. The finest of these is the brief \"Only Then,\" a glow of static and uncertain pitch that unfolds like a flower greeting the sun. The latter part of Ultramarin finds Jetone getting just a bit colder and darker. The percussion in \"Phoedra II\" sounds like the work of a backhoe, with chunks of crumbling concrete following each heavy blow. \"Untitled\" opts for an edgier palate, with a stern bassline and samples that seem stuck in an infinite loop. \"Fkstrtowr\" replicates the basic ambient format of \"Only Then,\" with harsher, more metallic noise standing in for the affirming hum. And \"Dakkar\" closes the album on its most aggressive note (and, not coincidentally, its most danceable), with electrotribal percussion and leanings toward house. Still, for the bulk of this fine record, Jetone shows a marked skill in crafting soothing body music as deep as it is wide. "}
