Pink's second album, Worn Copy, furthers his cultbaiting mystique as a bedroom hermit from suburban L.A. who conjures up ghosts by burning a roll of avocadogreen shag carpet unvacuumed for 30 years. To his credit, Pink has sharpened his songwriting and studio touches he has several 1970s AORpop Muzak formulas nailed, making his freakitude compelling and digestible. That's a quality Ween and Redd Kross sometimes failed to capture quotation marks were clearly and fashionably marked on their odes to that decade's trash culture. But the problem remains that if the fashionably shoddy production values are removed from the sound, Pink's music would melt into the air. Still, Worn Copy's first half is a gas. Opener \"Trepanated Earth\" begins with a hazy, synth and flanged guitar. Pink then mumbles something romantic before one of his split personalities interrupts, \"The human race is a pile of dogshit!\" and \"Mankind is a Nazi!\" After a few false starts and jumbled rickets, he then becomes a charming easylistening opening act for the Wings 75 tour. \"Immune to Emotion\" is nasally congested \"I'm OK, You're OK\" pop that could serve as country club luncheon entertainment. \"Jules Lost His Jewels\" is a 33rpm powerpop raveup cranked or \"Alvinized\" (as composer John Oswald might put it) to 45 with bloodlines that can be traced to the Mothers of Invention's \"Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance\". Pink's most poignant moments come when his lowfi smoke screen dissipates. \"Credit\" is a clever, discospiced lament that smokes its second pack of cigarettes over credit card policies and bills the mundane subject matter made so bizarre yet sensible for the inflationaddled 70s. \"Life in L.A.\" is a fine downerrock number with a languid mood that mimics the exhaustion of watching the sunset over a beach while you're trapped in a traffic jam on a freeway bridge. The rest of Worn Copy indulges in too many halfrealized noise experiments and ideas. \"Bloody! (Bagonia's)\" is Pink amusing himself with Tourette's syndrome, while the quasirap number \"Cable Access Follies\" earns a silver star for imitating Beck at his most confusing. By the way, did you know that this year marks the 10th anniversary of Mike Watt's sleeperhit \"Against the 70s\"? It's the tune where the legendary postpunk bassist has Eddie \"Crazy Horse disciple\" Vedder sing, \"The kids of today must defend themselves against the 70's!\" The key lyric goes: \"It's not reality/ It's someone else's sentimentality.\" "}
