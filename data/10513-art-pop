The cover completes the trio of primary colors that have adorned their releases, but it's also the first to include images of any kind, though the image is somewhat ambiguous. On the disc itself, the music is less spare and more diverse than it was on Profile or the Headgit EP. The title of the album is an obvious label for the type of music it contains it's sort of like putting a sticker that says \"apple\" on a granny Smith. There's a portion of the album where the \"pop\" half wins out considerably, and those songs tend to be the most satisfying all around. For opener \"On Your Own\", Newman largely leaves his usual Githead monotone behind in favor of the kind of gentle, harmonyfriendly singing we first heard from him on Wire's Chairs Missing almost 30 years ago. In fact, later in the album, the chorus melody of \"All Set Up\" flirts directly with the chorus melody of \"Outdoor Miner\". Rimbaud and Spigel sometimes double Newman, giving certain songs a melodically layered effect that wears quite well. Spigel is a bit more prominent, taking the lead on \"Lifeloops\" and \"Space Life\", two of the most divergent tracks on the album. \"Lifeloops\" is built around an acoustic guitar figure, distinguishing it from the sleek, electronic guitar tones on the rest of the album. The lyrics are no less abstract than any of Newman's image salads, though, and Spigel's deadpan delivery never really takes it anywhere. \"Space Life\" is quite a bit better, a swirling, stomping slice of future funk that features Spigel's intonations at the beginning and endneither track is quite as good as her showcase from Profile, \"My LCA (Little Box of Magic)\", which was the best song on that album.  The album's lowest point comes smack dab in the middle. \"Jet Ear Game\" is a synthesized soundscape that houses a voice (probably Spigel's) heavily coated in electronic processing, to the point of near unintelligibility (it's reading bits of Githeadrelated criticism, so take from that what you will). It sounds like it would have been interesting to put together, but it isn't very interesting to listen to. \"Drop\" and \"Darkest Star\" have decent beats but do little with them, producing surprisingly static final tracks.  It all makes the sublime pop of tracks like \"These Days\" stand out moreNewman really stretches himself as a songwriter and singer on these songs, and what he comes up with is truly excellent. Ultimately, though, Art Pop has a similar problem to its predecessor in that outside of a core of outstanding tracks it's fairly thin. It is, however, nice to hear the band evolving and experimenting and generally being treated like a major project by the participants.  "}
