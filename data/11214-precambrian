{"label":" Metal Blade","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/10992/homepage_large.2d50f8b5.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Cosmo Lee","artist":"Ocean","title":"Precambrian","text":" Berlin's the Ocean are a peculiar study in band management. Guitarist Robin Staps writes their music, then teaches it to a rotating cast basically, whomever is around. Staps estimates that the Ocean has five guitar players, but no more than two at a time. On a recent tour, one was a Swiss 19yearold plucked from the Internet. Twentysix musicians played on Precambrian, including a British vocalist (also found via the internet), various hardcore punk luminaries, and members of the Berlin Philharmonic (the band is currently seeking a longterm live cellist). Drums were recorded in Finland, while vocals were recorded in the U.S., Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany. Staps assembled these materials at his home base, a former aluminum factory for Uboats in World War II. Now dubbed Oceanland, it houses a recording studio, rehearsal space, and sleeping quarters. Such spaces are distinctly European, as is the Ocean's scope. The band has two sides; the first blends Neurosis' heaviness with Converge's angularity, while the second tempers the first with atmospheric keys and strings. To showcase these sides, the band's first two fulllengths, Fluxion and Aeolian, were originally planned as a double album. Their record label nixed this idea, but agreed to it for Precambrian. Its first disc is 22 minutes of metallic hardcore punk, while the gentler second disc sprawls across an hour. One 11minute song combines 84 tracks of audio. Even the packaging is epic in Europe, anyway. There, Precambrian comes in a colorfully layered, diecut digipak. Metal Blade's U.S. arm, citing American apathy to artwork, issued the album in a standard jewel case. Even such flat presentation requires two booklets of liner notes. Ostensibly, the album revolves around the Precambrian era, the first chapter in the earth's history. The discs are subtitled \"Hadean/Archaean\" and \"Proterozoic\", the two halves of the era; their subdivisions are the song titles: \"Siderian\", \"Rhyacian\", and so on. Staps wrote the music first, then applied this conceptual framework.  Such post hoc construction risks pretension, but the framework fits. Unlike Isis' minimalism and Neurosis' elemental bent, the Ocean is beautifully baroque. Even its harder side is artsy. \"Neoarchaean\" begins with earlySpoon indiearena rock, then detonates with drum rolls and spiraling guitars. \"Eoarchaean\" throws sharp elbows, but tags on a Middle Easternflavored coda. Disc two parallels the reconstruction of life after the Oxygen Catastrophe. It starts as a cleantoned spaghetti western, patiently building before exploding with distortion. \"Statherian\"'s 6/8 recalls Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\", then leaps into synthsprinkled thrash. \"Cryogenian\"'s piano ostinato suggests \"Linus and Lucy\" dressed in black. The Ocean had such colors before, but they pulse more vividly in these spacious settings. \"Calymmian\" layers Pink Floyd slide guitar over mournful cello. In \"Stenian\", Radiohead does \"Hotel California\", as strings keen underneath. But crushing distortion buries the dirge; there will be blood, indeed.  Unlike Mastodon's Leviathan, which simply set Moby Dick to song, Precambrian isn't about rocks and lava. The lyrics bristle with natural imagery, but they're metaphoric. During the Precambrian era's Oxygen Catastrophe, oxygen and methane products of photosynthesis built up and caused mass extinction of anaerobic organisms. The obvious parallel is global warming. Precambrian, however, addresses human destruction more generally. \"Hadean\" declaims, \"Sitting out the goosestep of the long march of the yesmen/ As their gold cardwielding wives are consumed by bitterness.\" \"Archaean\" is likewise anticonsumerist: \"We'd pay any price to buy everything/ We stand in line and smile...Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives.\" \"Paleoarchaean\" sets Baudelaire's \"Man and the Sea\" to ripping hardcore punk; the vocals draw out the English translation and grind it on gravel: \"The sea is your mirror; you contemplate your soooooul/ In its eternal waves that chafe and roooooll.\" When man fights the sea, he ultimately fights himself. Precambrian is gaudily dense with literary references. Quotes from the Comte de Lautréamont's Les Chants de Maldoror fill the liner notes, as well as the entirety of \"Mesoarchaean\"; \"Neoarchaean\" draws from de Lautréamont's \"Poésies\". \"Ectasian\" sets Austrian poet Georg Trakl's \"De Profundis\" to Panteraesque hemiolas. In \"Rhyacian\", Staps mixes his words with those of Nietzsche and de Lautréamont. He overreaches, as his lyrics are bluntly unpoetic. But even if his references aren't narratively coherent, they're spiritually congruent. Staps is fighting for the human soul. His liner notes contain a mission statement: \"Precambrian is our stance against MySpaceinduced volatileness and transience...It is an album for people who still believe in the idea that an album can be more, and should be more, than the sum of its tracks.\" In concept, packaging, and strata, Precambrian defiantly shakes up the human fossil record.
