{"label":" Domino","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/15026/homepage_large.70c7689a.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Amy Granzin","artist":"Archie Bronson Outfit","title":"Coconut","text":" Archie Bronson Outfit's last album, Derdang Derdang, had a winning way with a tired genre, divesting psychedelic garage rock of all but its essentials: swaggering grooves, stabbing riffs, and gouging pop hooks. Aesthetic differences aside, songs like \"Dart for My Sweetheart\" and \"Cherry Lips\" were almost Spoonlike in their economy. And while ABO singer/guitarist Sam Windett's voice isn't conventionally pretty, he conveyed a rare emotional intensity, even danger. Derdang's timing, however, was unfortunate. Ahead of any garage rock revival, the 2006 LP dovetailed with the rise and UK chart triumph of Arctic Monkeys.No surprise then that, four years later, the bearded trio's copping a different sound one that includes synthesizers, dance beats, and Tim Goldsworthy's production work. Lame bandwagonjumping? Actually, no. Former DFAcohoncho Goldsworthy didn't stamp his dancepunk signature on every one of Coconut’s tracks, but the ones he did are uniformly ace. On first single \"Shark's Teeth\", ABO's buzzsawing guitars and punk instincts are preserved, but leavened with Hercules & Love Affairstyle disco nostalgia. \"Hoola\"'s another peak, its cooing female backups flirting with Windett's strangulated yelp in a swirl of beats and hooks. Two psychedelic raveups on the record's first half, \"Magnetic Warrior\" and \"Wild Strawberries\", offer both delirious drone and expert popcraft.But Coconut stumbles midway through with \"You Have a Right to a Mountain Life/One Up on Yourself\". A title like that's a tipoff, and the song is indeed a malodorous heap of bellowing reverb, guitar noodling, and dire lyrics like \"Eat your heart out/ It's yours to eat.\" \"Mountain\" is only four minutes long, but feels like 40. However, it may be preferable to the several cuts that follow. With little of their predecessors' electropop sparkle or psychedelic fireworks, but plodding rhythms and vanillaflavored melodies to spare, tracks like \"Bite It & Believe It\" and \"Hunt You Down\" kill any momentum the album had generated.In fact, the whole second half of Coconut would be a wash if it weren't for finale \"Run Gospel Singer\", in which Windett assumes a favorite role as maidentemptingMephistopheles. \"You're a gospel singer and I am a seller of songs\" he wheezes over swishy tambourines and Arp Cleveland's headlonged kick drums. The track's rough and rushed, but also sexy and spontaneous, leaving you wishing the album offered more like it. So, yes, Coconut seems to be a \"transition album\": A sometimesexhilarating, sometimesWTF layover between a possibly playedout formula and exciting new sounds on the horizon. "}
