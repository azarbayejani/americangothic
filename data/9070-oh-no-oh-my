Oh My!","text":"  The DIY ethic's nothing new, as any caveman will tell you, but in the indie universe it still matters, especially for bands relying on throngs of internet hype and scenesters' word of mouth. Like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Nashvillebased Oh No! Oh My!'s debut is selfreleased and registers across the indie spectrum and beyond, drawing comparisons from the Shins to Simon and Garfunkel. However, Nashville ain't no Brooklyn, and certainly no one's spotting David Byrne or David Bowie at their gigs. Throw in the band's Googlephobic moniker, and you've got yourself a hype machine running solely on a MySpace page and scattered blog fumes. Songwriting duo Greg Barkley and Daniel Hoxmeler pull off the halfserious, halfgoofball indie shtick just about as well as you'd expect from two proud homeschoolers. Obviously the guys have girl troubles, though they're just as likely to deal with them earnestly (\"Goodbye to my sweetheart/ You fill my day up like a spark\") as they are in tongueincheek, Violent Femmes fashion (\"Jane Is Fat\", \"Women Are Born in Love\"). This pullnopunches, anything goes strategy creates a more relaxed, effortless feel than so many starchy indie upandcomers vexed by the desire to immaculately emulate their favorite influences. Using twee as a jumping off point, the band utilizes an orchestra's worth of instruments that takes their sound through altcountry, electropop, and back. Opener \"Skip the Foreplay\" is a \"Sesame Street\"flavored flourish, despite lyrics about sex and pregnancy. Barkley sweetly coos the story of an overeager lothario who impregnates a girl before bursting into an Ã¼bercute chorus of \"doodoos\" and \"nahs\" over sparkling synthesizer lines. \"Walk in the Park\" could become your favorite summer folk jam. Bouncing ebulliently from chord to chord, the band hedges the song's wideeyed gush and familyfriendly snapshots with a melancholy sound that quickly evaporates into the singsong chorus.  Unfortunately, too many tracks simply dote on impish melodies and moony aesthetics. Songs like \"Lisa Make Love! (It's Okay!)\" and \"Women Are Born in Love\" simply run out of steam where more confident tracks \"Jane is Fat\" and \"I Have No Sister\" motor through hooks and stylistic twists. Luckily nothing's too egregious here, and the album drops at a propitious time considering the bubbly images it conjures of ice cream trucks, beach balls, and slackers having awkward sex. Although exhibiting rather unassuming technical chops, the band's unique charisma should garner results in your heart's blog search engine, if not Technorati's.  "}
