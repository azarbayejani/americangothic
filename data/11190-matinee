He has some of Pete Doherty's visionary busker schtick, some of the cosy chattiness of Kate Nash, and some of the brisk optimism of goofy UK chart darlings Scouting For Girls. It's no surprise that he's done rather well in Britain. This debut album opens with \"Spit At Stars\", all his signature elements on show: the chunky, quickstrummed acoustic guitar, the undeniably sticky hooks, and most of all the breathless vocals and philosophical lyrics. Peñate's thoughtful bent is what sets his approach apart from his pop friendslist: he sings like he's just read the secrets of the universe in his fish and chip wrapper and is bursting to pass them on. So what are they? Here's where the trouble starts. \"Made Of Codes\" and \"Learning Lines\" tell us that society's structures come prescripted: \"Deciphering is the game we're all in.\" On \"We Will Be Here\" he takes a still wider view: \"So small, oh so small are we/ By 'we' I mean all humanity.\" What's the solution? Well, like he says on \"Spit At Stars\", \"we all got our dreams,\" and it turns out our smallness is what makes us human: \"The stars can't feel a lover's touch.\" Matinée is full of these little aphorisms, and Peñate's heartfelt presence means that your impression of the album is going to be quite closely related to whether you think they're full of shit or not.  One of Peñate's problems is that his gift for showing gets overtaken by his penchant for telling. \"Got My Favourite\" runs through some of his most treasured clothes, noting who gave him each of them. The point is clear and sweet our lives are a collection of connections but he has to ram it home with a chorus that clumsily explains exactly what he's saying. His quirky observations are always crushed by explanations, and only on his ballads does he stop cramming in thirty words per line. Listening to Matinée straight through is exhausting, like being trapped in the kitchen at a college party while someone with curiously wide eyes Explains It All to you.  Mind you, those wideeyed guys tended to have pretty intriguing love lives: Matinée is at its best when Peñate turns his eyes from the cosmos and attends to matters of the heart. \"My Yvonne\" keeps it simple and gentle, a hushed infatuation ballad which gives Peñate's melodic touch much needed space. The best of his upbeat tracks, meanwhile, is \"Have I Been A Fool?\", where he's the one doing the unrequiting and worrying he's leading a girl on. The song isn't much more than a pretty piano figure and a sense of rhythm but it suits Peñate's intimate style.  The most interesting track, though, is \"Run For Your Life\", partly because it appears to be starting a beef with Dizzee Rascal. \"Don't fix up or look sharp\", he says, while calling out bullies everywhere with the passion of the sometime victim. It's brave, and not disagreeable, and it nails Peñate's appeal: everything on Matinée suggests he's a decent guy. But just as you're warming to him he comes out with another oneliner like \"no one owns what nature's grown,\" and you're forced to remember that good men can also make bad records.  "}
