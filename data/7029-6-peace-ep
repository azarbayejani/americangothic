Jan Jelinek sings. Pole recruited a rapper for his next fulllength. Mouse on Mars added the goldenvoiced Dodo. Dan Snaith of Manitoba traded his MAX/MSP patches for bababa's. Over the last three years, a lot of artists making abstract electronic music who previously nodded in the direction of pop took a page out of Eric Carmen's book and went all the way. And it's a good thing. It's good because this meeting offers another avenue to explore, not because pop songs are something every musician should strive for. There's a lot to be done with this place where experimental electronics and chaotic beats collide with pop music. If vocal IDM becomes its own subgenre and history remembers it, Schneider TM's year 2000 collaboration with KP.T Michigan on \"The Light 3000\", an inspired remake of The Smiths' \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\", will surely be acknowledged as an early classic. What Schneider TM and KP.T Michigan did was to take a perfect song about a brief respite from loneliness and remove the respite part. Listening to The Smiths, I always imagined the narrator in \"There Is a Light\" picking up a telephone to call his friend at the beginning of the song, begging him to take them both to a place \"where there's music and there's people who are young and alive.\" His home life is terrible, but experience has shown him that he can extricate himself, both physically and psychically, by hitting the town with his pal. Sure, he welcomes death while riding shotgun beneath the overpass during the chorus, but it's because he wants to die happy, not because life isn't worth living. And whatever happens, he is not alone. In \"The Light 3000\", on the other hand, I think the friend is imaginary. The way Schneider TM processes his voice, I believe in my heart that his request to \"take me out tonight\" could not possibly be answered. He's too different, too damaged, a mutant. The warm, glitchy beats are friendly enough, but the narrator is stuck at home, maybe forever. When the track first came to my attention in 2000, it became, for a time, a pretty hot download on Napster, and the image of thousands of people the world over hearing it over their PC speakers as they surfed the web into the wee hours reinforced for me just how painfully lonely \"The Light 3000\" really was. The inclusion of \"The Light 3000\" is the best reason to get this sixsong EP, which is being released to coincide with Schneider TM's forthcoming tour with The Faint. The Binokular EP, where the song first appeared, came out on City Slang and never received a proper North American release. Another track from Binokular, \"Chotto Matte\", also appears here. \"Chotto Matte\" is okay, but I would have preferred the earlier EP's other vocal track, the feedbackladen and melodic \"Onnanoko\". The rest of the 6 Peace EP is filled out with the album version of \"Reality Check\" from last year's Zoomer, a solid, noisier, beatheavy remix of same by Mogwai and David Jack (taken from the \"Reality Check\" 12inch), and two remixes of \"Frogtoise\", which appeared on the 12inch of the same name. \"Frogstears\" is the better of these. The simple arrangement, just acoustic guitar, some digital claps in the background, and Dirk Dresselhaus' voice, shows that it's a lovely song even without production accouterment. The harmonica fills (!) are a little much, but the song is so likeable it's easy to let Dirk have his Neil Young moment. There are videos of \"Reality Check\" and \"Frogtoise\" included, for those interested in that sort of thing, but really, this one is all about \"The Light 3000\". Everyone should hear it. "}
