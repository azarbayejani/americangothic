The San Francisco garagerocker has always been prolific, but after four years of albums, collaborations, singles, and covers, his discography has become particularly unwieldy. His output from the past year alone has been diverse. On Slaughterhouse (and on stage), he's an impish, thrashing apostle of hardcore and 1970s hard rock. With Hair, his collaborative album with White Fence, he angled for jamheavy, psychleaning rock'n'roll. Only a year ago, he delivered his \"serious\" album Goodbye Bread, where he both cooed calmly and screamed about an exploding head. Impressively, all three of those albums are really good. It's a testament to Segall as a restless songwriter who can adapt to, and successfully execute, several different styles. So here we are with Twins, his third LP of 2012, which stands at the intersection of all of his recent interests.  In the tradition of Lemons and Melted, which each had ballads alongside searing garage punk, the new album doesn't have a unified focus. With the exception of frenzied, shredding highlight \"You're the Doctor\", there's nothing especially aggressive. \"Gold on the Shore\" is his acousticdriven, folky, sentimental love song. Then there's \"The Hill\", the bleary psych track where Segall's voice recalls John Lennon's on \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". (The track also features some beautiful vocals from Thee Oh Sees' Brigid Dawson.) There are familiar elements from Segall's backlog in play, like that specific fuzz guitar tone, which is something like his trademark at this point, and some twominute songs a number that's especially apparent on his recent Singles collection. Those bitesized singles pop next to lengthier tracks like \"Ghost\", the slower stoned jam, or the romantic and apocalyptic closer \"There Is No Tomorrow\". With each new song, hook, idea, and tone, it's increasingly clear that Twins doesn't fit in any one box. It's a grab bag, and it's easy to view it as a disappointment to look at Segall's disparities in 2012 and want him to pick a sound and follow it for 12 tracks. But alongside his engineer partner Eric Bauer (often credited as \"King Riff\"), he delivers a series of songs that, despite their aesthetic differences, flow very well. Even when he makes a significant jump, like from the giddy rampage of \"You're the Doctor\" to the paranoid stoicism of \"Inside Your Heart\", there's usually an easy thematic or sonic transition that keeps the album from sounding like a compilation. In that way, it's close in format to Goodbye Bread, which maintained cohesion despite several shifts in delivery and tone. Twins' offerings, however, are far more sugary and immediate: faster tempos, thicker fuzz, more power. Lyrically, Segall thrives in two modes: songs about love with very straightforward wording (\"Love Fuzz\" is a falsetto stab at seduction; the content of \"Would You Be My Love\" is pretty much stated right there in the title), and stories with a more fantastical bent. The latter approach was prevalent on Slaughterhouse and especially \"I Bought My Eyes\", and it comes into play here with the darkly abstract \"Handglams\" and the creepy \"is it living inside of me\" tale of \"Inside Your Heart\".  In the liner notes, Segall writes two things that feel fitting for Twins. \"This record is for San Francisco.\" That makes sense the man's a frontrunner to become San Francisco's garage laureate. But he's also talking about his friends and inspirations he mentions White Fence's Tim Presley, Thee Oh Sees' John Dwyer, and the rest of the Ty Segall Band by name. It's easy to hear how the album fits tidily in San Francisco's bigger picture to hear Dwyer's \"falsettoasprimaryvocal\" on \"Love Fuzz\" and \"Handglams\", to hear Sic Alps' elegant minimalism on \"Gold on the Shore\", to hear the whole town's penchant for mysterious and druggy storytelling, etc.  His final \"thank you\" in the liner notes goes to Neil Young, an artist who, as soon as the masses pegged him with a genre, did whatever the fuck he wanted to do and didn't look back; who never compromised on his vision, even when it meant making a bizarre, shitty rockabilly album in 1983; who famously \"headed for the ditch\" when he felt his radio hits were \"middle of the road.\" Twins doesn't stick to the middle or even pick a lane. It swerves, visiting territory welltread with a perspective that feels new, and knowing Segall, he probably won't make another album that sounds like it any time soon. "}
