He's dazzled by the sudden appreciation his music is getting.\" Of course, it's all Prater's doing. Sure, acoustic guitarist Estribou recorded the Grateful Dead and released their first single in 1965. But that's hardly enough to keep the man on even the most detailed of musical maps, let alone earn a dazzling level of popularity.JeanPaul Pickens is also one of popular music's many footnotes, a banjoist in Bay Area poet David Meltzer's psych/folkrock outfit Serpent Power, who could claim to be among the pioneers of Hindi modesmeetsWestern pop \"ragafolk.\" But that's a boast that could also be made by John Fahey or Sandy Bull or Robbie Basho all of whom worked at nearly the same time as, and were more innovative than, Pickens. And so it follows that Intensifications, Estribou and Pickens' split LP of solo improvised instrumentals, fell by the wayside.Intensifications is not and never was groundbreaking even at its most extreme, the improvisations are still relatively normal given the Bashoweirdo benchmark. But the album is solid, and, amidst the current freefolk love affair, is certainly relevant and worthy of its remastering, rerelease, and reconsideration.To an extent, improvised solo instrumentals are less about a song and more about the player's technical ability, so showboating factors heavily into one's appreciation of these virtuosic displays. And despite the album's split nature, Estribou and Pickens complement each other well. Estribou's conceits are primarily tonal and less rhythmic. The raga opener, \"You Know, the One You Played Saturday Night\", is somewhat dogmatic, beginning high and ghostly before settling into breezy strums and high noon modal ebbing. Slide picks and Delta blues licks dominate Estribou's tense doubleplucked meanderings on \"Amalgam\", whereas \"Metathanks\" seems decidedly more guiltfree, structured and countrified. Estribou's last cut, \"Eeee Minor\", is at once his most musically and rhythmically energetic piece, as he carefully fits his most abrasive dissonances alongside dactylic jitter.Pickens' portion of the record smokes from the start. On \"Coo Coo Bird\", Pickens begins with a wash of strings before launching into some swift and hyperrhythmic but still remarkably melodic Americana banjo. Burner \"Shady Grows\" sounds like a Celtic woodwind ditty performed at Rescue Ranger speeds, albeit also with a high degree of melodic retention. And the sprawling \"G.R.\" is Pickens' answer to the variety of playing styles Estribou displays on \"Eeee Minor\", as he places nongimmicky rubato oneliners between dense, swift packets of terrific strumming. In a fictitious world where virtuoso folk guitarists contest for title belts, \"G.R.\" would cinch Pickens' victory over Estribou. But there's no need for a grudge match here: Intensifications features impressive performance from both artists. "}
