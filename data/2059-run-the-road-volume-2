Since its rapturous reception, RtR's perfect snapshot of a starving scene has paid dividends in the form of Kano's stunning Home Sweet Home LP and Lady Sov's continuing streak of munchkin tales along with her recent Stateside Def Jam deal. So, as the chorus to Run The Road Volume 2's icebreaker aptly asks, \"Who's gonna be next with 16 lines?\" With the jawsmacking wtf?! factor vastly diminished, this sequel offers a slightly wobbly answer to that question by attempting to expand its predecessor's definition of grime in new, sometimes dubious directions. Perhaps a bit tired of the Wembleysized arcade crunk sound, those pushing RtR2's brazen buttons try for a little more polish and nuance. The epic introduction, \"Get Set\", proves that such ambitions have the potential to be fruitfully realized. Stinging strings counteract the track's deepdigging bass while wailing backing vocals offer some cinematic shading. The song also boasts RtR2's most impressive union of mic fiends as golden boy Kano competes with Ghetto and Demon for infinite rewinds. Coming off like a grime version of Puffy's \"Victory\", \"Get Set\" successfully takes the young hybrid genre to uncharted levels of grandiosity. It also stands well above the rest of RtR2 in scope and execution. The rest of the record is hardly a failure but, next to its progenitor and sprawling opener, it gets stuck underneath a grey cloud that rains whispers of inferiority. Ghetto once again pounces and plunges into the beat with his quick tongue on \"Run the Road\"; too bad the Destiny's Child leftover r&b; hook falls woefully flat in its attempt for some kind of crossover push. Although JME shows lyrical promise on \"Serious\", his onenote bitching about emcees discussing shanks and breasts quickly becomes just as trite and pointless. And No Lay's \"Unorthodox Chick\" seems to exist only as a lesser foil to her previous RtR stomper, \"Unorthodox Daughter\". Even when the record goes way out of its comfort zone as on Klashnekoff's Nasstyle, grimefree \"Can't You See?\", the track's Yank tendencies are clearly secondrate. As RtR2's final two tracks suggest, maybe it was too early to tinker with grime's bloodrush Space Invader bombs. Featuring the boisterous, appropriately dubbed Bear Man, \"Drink Beer\" doesn't pussyfoot around its titular purpose as it wildly veers off the rails drunk off six pints of Strongbow. Same case with Dynasty Crew's mobsterhorn blaring \"Bare Face Dynasty\", which offers a spiritual and sonically appropriate successor to RtR's completely mad \"Destruction VIP\". Both tracks revel in the chaos that much of RtR2 lacks. Still, this comp doesn't indicate grime's death knell or anything just its tobeexpected semiawkward growing pains. "}
