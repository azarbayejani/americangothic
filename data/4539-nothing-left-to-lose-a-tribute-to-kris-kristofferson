Shame on those of us who only know him as the guy with the feathery hair on the cover of some album we saw stacked inside one of Mom's crapboard endtables alongside Lionel Richie, Air Supply, and those hunky Kenny's: Loggins and Rogers. Shame on us, because the very educated Kristofferson was an estimable American songwriter (though I have to pitch my tent across the field from those who'd label him one of the Greats). Kristofferson's most impacting work strings together the observations of chronically defeated visionaries. These minimartyrs can be absorbedly selfpitying, like prisoners who pay lip service to free livin', but their capacity for surrender yields some powerfully fatalistic evaluations of hope. \"Jesus Was a Capricorn\" is possibly the best synthesis of Kristofferson's concerns (Low's messianic hypothesis \"If You Were Born Today\" owes this tune a debt), and Diana Darby's minimal, whispered rendition is only one of the reasons this compilation trumps 2002's other Krisnod Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down. This disc's roster is largely a who'swho of subdued altfolkrock, both traditional and progressive. Souled American's sloptwinkle handling of the lastchance anthem \"Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends\" is both brainy and sentimental, ideal for those fidgety hours before one's pride allows them to hit the bar or bottle. Both Califone offerings, \"Borderlord\" and \"Nobody Wins\" (the latter a teamup with Rebecca Gates) prove my thesis that this band doesn't know how to bore: they use all manner of digital manipulation, yet still sound earthy and interplanetary, yet symphonic and hymnal, despite their staticblasts. They contrast overstated and understated percussion, they strain pianos they even serve up some phased Olivia Tremor Control transitions. Calexico defies their predictable cactusfunk formula by adding an amazingly sour organ tone and NicoversusMarleneDietrich vixen vox to \"Casey's Last Ride\". Radar Brothers' deservedly increasing fanbase should pounce all over their panoramic \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\", and if my ears don't lie, that's Brother Jim Putnam's thinsoul throat fronting a much warmer Court & Spark on their \"For the Good Times\" (one of at least three songs about opportunistic excouples saying \"What the hey, let's get it on\"). The showoffs in Zmrzlina and Milkchopper create the comp's richest soundscapes, mixing sixstring theatrics with windshield wipers, drum tracks, radio samples, anxious keys, doleful strings, and layered, coed vocals. Their pairing deconstructs Kristofferson's most famous song to the point of redefinition, editing the refrain down to, \"Freedom's just another word for nothing.\" The rest acquit themselves as well: Richard Buckner is a moving fit for the strumming \"Loving Her Was Easier\" ; Crooked Jades make a hootenanny of \"Shipwrecked in the Eighties\". Virgil Shaw and Howe Gelb both tip their hats amenably to the outsider ethos, but Deanna Varagona threatens to oversing Kris' great line about \"seeking salvation we don't understand.\" Creeper Lagoon's \"Why Me\" and the Handsome Family's \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" are decent, but labor in the shadows of Johnny Cash's and Crooked Fingers' recent revisitations. Only Grandaddy's powertrio take on \"Best of All Possible Worlds\" (the polar opposite of the version from Bernstein's Candide) reeks of sleepwalkers' drool. You could insert a lengthy rumination on the futility/plurality of tribute compilations here, but recall that the oftcovered Kristofferson reportedly wrote a song called \"Let's All Get Together and Steal Each Other's Songs\". To their considerable credit, most of the artists on this austere compilation strive to give a little back. "}
