On his label debut, 11:11, that means dispensing cordial party anthems (\"Pound That Beer\") with Big 12 fight song handclaps and plenty of social realism (a glib survey of Mac's workingclass buddies and foils on \"Know It All\"). Technically, Mac's more ambitious than his tools will allow. When he tries to spiral into gatlinggun assonance his breath control fails him, vowels indecipherable from gasps. He's got more than his share of annoying habits: telling everyone what a song is about before the song starts, and trying balance out his everyman, toothless \"I get sad too!\" melancholy with the Marxism so many indierappers seem to adore. But Lethal isn't naïve. His previous Love Potion compilations released on Kansas City label Black Clover have chugged along for about half a decade. He knows his audience enough to hate the same things they hate, and to keep tongue firmly in cheek when he compares a girl's body to a bottle of Shiraz and namechecks Cool Water Cologne. For God's sake, he proudly barks: \"I used to like Tool!\" You keep looking, prodding, interrogating 11:11's thin 14 tracks for something more than the aesthetic of averageness, the homogenized middleclass confessions and triumphs and complaints \"this world is plastic and fake/ And I was born a few generations late\" and you dig up bland string screeches, typically \"jazzy\" independent rap drum loops, and a few subversive giggles \"a gun named Corey Feldman and a gun named Corey Haim!\"  Despite Mac Lethal's faults and deficiencies, he's a local boy, and it's probably no coincidence that when he settles and focuses on his hometown he actually loosens up and finds a way to blend his Puckish tendency with social pulls. The album closes with the almost beautiful \"Sun Storm\" where Lethal praises the wind on the Great Plains, and paints KC as over a warm acoustic: \"I'm from the Meth lab city of broken dreams and cracked out dopamine's/ Where everybody looking for an ocean scene/ Where Pac and Big are passé cause back home/ We speak in terms of Mack Dre and Fat Tone.\" Through all the labels and veils and we finally get down to what Mac Lethal believes in Kansas City first, everything else second.
