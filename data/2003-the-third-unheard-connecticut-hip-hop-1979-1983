The backbeat for what was, in fact, New England's first hiphop track, \"Rappin' with Mr. Magic\", sounds remarkably like the break from Chic's \"Good Times\", famously sampled by New York City's Sugarhill Gang for 1979's \"Rapper's Delight\". Magic's beat is not \"Good Times\" it's actually a live band rerecording of Vaughn Mason's \"Bounce, Rock, Skate...\" but his track's similarity to \"Rapper's Delight\", which is generally considered the first successful hiphop single ever, seems a boldly confrontational move. Lyrically, the parallels are even more apparent. Mr. Magic, who built the Southern Connecticut hiphop scene on his own after hearing Kurtis Blow's \"Christmas Rappin'\", spends nine minutes defending the rap abilities of the Constitution State, concluding with an ode to loyalty: a roll call of Connecticut towns. Magic's point is that the Connecticut scene could step to anything coming out of NYC, and while that may not have been completely true, CT did produce a worthwhile crop. New York, of course, never really got on the commuter rail to check out Mr. Magic, or Pookey Blow, or The Outlaw Four, or Willie Brown & Woodie. In fact, the City itself was close enough that if aspiring Connecticut rappers really wanted to be a part of the New York scene, it wasn't such a hassle to move there much of Southern Connecticut commuted to work in New York anyway. It's reasonable to assume, then, that Mr. Magic's scene was extremely committed to itself, yet still reaped the benefits of New York's close proximity it was an insular scene, but not devoid of influences. Which, along with the downright fantastic tracks recovered here, is what makes this compilation is so fascinating. With The Third Unheard, Stones Throw's Egon and Peanut Butter Wolf perform two great services to hiphop. First, they successfully reconstruct an extremely talented and fiercely loyal musical scene that was clearly part of the early New York old school, even if the Big Apple didn't actively assume so. Secondly, the tracks on The Third Unheard are gloriously littered with quotes from early old school New York singles, which in itself implies that even early on, hiphop was extremely conscious of genre. So that's the historical stuff; obviously, though, the tracks here are fun as hell. Mr. Magic's introduction is followed by two tracks from Magic's 12yearold nephew Pookey Blow: one of them, \"Get Up (And Go to School)\" samples the heavy auxiliary percussion and sparse guitar hits of Herman Kelly's \"Dance to the Drummer's Beat\", adding some cartoondreary synth and kazoo solos, all while Pookey laments being in school, falling asleep in English class, and wasting time when he could be rapping. In the end, though, Pookey agrees with the title's directive: \"You gotta go to school and learn all you can, if you wanna be the president of\" I think (and hope) \"Japan.\" Mr. Magic takes the kazoo shtick one step further on houseparty song \"2001 Kazoos\", for which he recruits the Positive Choice band to back his own rap and even more persistent synths, whistles, and kazoo choruses. The Outlaw Four's \"Million Dollar Legs\" boasts one of the comp's catchier choruses (\"Just dance to the rhythm of The Outlaw Four!\") and perhaps its thickest groove, not to mention plenty of individual gems (\"How you doin' pretty mama? It ain't no thing/ If you wear your panty hose with the static cling\"). The song finds its counterpart in the equally catchy \"Shake Your Booty\" by the 3 Chillie MCs, whose open desire for wealth and recognition marks a shift in tone from the rest of the disc: \"We've paid our debt, we did our time/ Now we're here to make money off our rhyme.\" Clearly, The Third Unheard's most bizarre track is Willie Brown & Woodie's \"Ventriloquist Rap\", where, in fact, Willie and his puppet Woodie trade verses over Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Best of My Love\", anticipating the schizophrenia Madlib feigns with Quasimoto on Madvillain's \"America's Most Blunted\". If nothing else, The Third Unheard is an extremely refreshing return to the carefree spirit and highlevel energy of hiphop's formative stages. Unburdened by tradition during this early era, Mr. Magic and the Southern Connecticut scene dove headlong into excitement, blissfully unconcerned with the potential influence or importance of their recordings let alone whether their art might one day evolve into pop music's most visible form.
