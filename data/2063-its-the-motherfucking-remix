{"label":" The Rub","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/2047/homepage_large.60dfc594.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jamin Warren","artist":"The Rub","title":"It's the Motherfucking Remix","text":" At the start of 2004, the term \"mashup\" finally went overground in the U.S. when Danger Mouse's infringorama The Grey Album earned the bootleg blue ribbon for its surgical deconstruction of the Beatles' sound. But while some cats are trying to make sense from absurdity by calling a spade a spade, let's be perfectly honest: The rock guitar vs. emcee isn't new. Run DMC did it, Public Enemy did it, even Onyx did it. Fortunately, DJ Ayres and co. skip the semantics: It's the Motherfucking Remix. Known for the innovative sets at the Brooklynbased Rub parties, The Remix carries all the energy and creativity for BK crowds itchin' to scuff up their dancing shoes. The collection capitalizes on two elements: originality and flow. Listening to Mobb Deep's Prodigy boast about murderous blood splatters on his daughter over the Ghostbusters theme evokes a few chuckles, but succeeds because the synthtuba perfectly accents the Queensboro duo's spitfire. Nick Catchdub's cross between middle school favorite \"Cannonball\" and \"Party & FireShit\" combines a fiery Rah \"Ima beat that bitch with a bat\" Digga with Lollapalooza. (For all you Phillyheads, it's like Y100 shaking hands with Power 99.) Of course not every single was ever meant for crossbreeding. The Beatles' \"And I Love Her\" and Kelis' \"Milkshake\" is an unholy alliance of a shameful degree. Gregory Isaacs over \"Go DJ\" is wholly cacophonous. And Mark Ronson rides the gimmick pony with \"Bombs Over Baghdad\" and \"Take Me Out\". C'mon duke, I know there's at least one other record in the crate. And, of course, conceptually this doesn't clear any new ground other than offering a new platform for some rising deejays. Nonetheless, The Remix is honest and creative. \"Culo\" and \"Let's Go to Bed\"? Motherfucking brilliant. "}
