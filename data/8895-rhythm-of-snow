{"label":" Force Inc","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/8746/homepage_large.2a44839d.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Paul Cooper","artist":"Yagya","title":"Rhythm of Snow","text":" The subhead to Rhythm of Snow would read, \"Computer science student denerds himself.\" By day Aalsteinn Gumundsson (for Yagya is he) taps away at code and virtual logic gates. But by night, he and his computers attempt to \"reflect the beauty of the world.\" And I hear tell that there's a lot of beauty up there in Iceland. It snows a lot and there's plenty of precipitation and wind. Not everyone finds such things beautiful, though there is something inviting in Gumundsson's drony representation of drizzle, sleet, and ice. But I have to break up my lovefest because, while nice enough in exectuion, Rhythm of Snow is an imitation (albeit a faultless one) of Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project. Both Voigt and Gumundsson expertly arrange natural ambient sounds (wind, rustling leaves, rain) and weave dulcet melodies through nature's soft white noise. Gumundsson has divided the seventyeight minutes of Rhythm of Snow into ten sections, all titled \"Snowflake.\" While I'm uneasy about a rain shower being called a snowflake (a rain shower is the central motif of multiple \"Snowflake[s]\") the fact that Gumundsson has titled his tracks identically is fitting, because they pretty much are identical, apart from microscopic differences in size and shape. \"Snowflake 8\" pushes the rain shower sounds of \"Snowflake 7\" further back in the mix and brings forward a Rhythm and Sound digital skank. \"Snowflake 4\" incorporates microhouse clicks and hiss but backs them up with a formidable warping groove that Detroit's Ion would badmouth DJ Assault's ghettotech for. The most dynamic of the snowflakes, \"Snowflake 5,\" bears a deep house bassline that sustains the same Mellotron \"aahs\" that the Orb used at the beginning of \"A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain.\" \"Snowflake 6\" pads out nine minutes with cricket chirrups and a dulled kickdrum for lowend action. \"Snowflake 9\" is much more lugubrious, all but discarding the kickdrum that sounds increasingly redundant as the album progresses. Much of Rhythm of Snow is interchangeable. Gumundsson shows that he can riff on other musicians' themes. But if you're in the right mood (whether pharmaceutically, or whether your brainwaves are flattening out in preparedness to slip into the arms of Morpheus), you can't beat this stuff. At seventyeight minutes, even the most crankedup speedfreak would be lulled into the realm of dreams. However, judged only by Rhythm of Snow, Gumundsson certainly hasn't exhibited the range of style that Wolfgang Voigt has shown. As well as this type of soft beat, Voigt has produced crazy acid, house, and synth homages to Marc Bolan. Rhythm of Snow is as a commendable a starting place as any, but Gumundsson will have to release very different, original material if he's not going to melt swiftly away from collective memory. "}
