{"label":" Empyrean","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/3305/homepage_large.b54b33d3.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stephen M. Deusner","artist":"Ffa Coffi Pawb","title":"Am Byth: Casgliad O Ganeuon Coll '86-'92","text":" Am Byth means \"for ever,\" and that's a mighty long time. The Welsh phrase proves a particularly ironic title for this rarities collection, not only because the band in question, Ffa Cowfi Pawb, has been defunct for more than a decade, but also because it has been handily overshadowed by its members' subsequent groups. Gruff Rhys and Daffyd Ieuan cofounded Super Furry Animals in 1993, Rhodri Puw joined Gorky's Zygotic Mynci after John Lawrence left, and Dewi Emlyn has toured with those two bands as well as Mogwai and Cornelius, among others. By comparison, Ffa Coffi Pawb (which means \"everybody's coffee beans\") is basically obscure, at least to nonWelsh audiences. Formed in 1986, when they were university students, the band called it quits seven years later when heavy touring of Wales led to almost no touring outside of Wales. They released four albums altogether (three on Welsh label Ankst), but none are in print. Am Byth is their only surviving record, as of this writing anyway. But that title isn't some Oasissize declaration of selfimportance; it's more like a mission statement. Ffa Coffi Pawb wanted to make durable music. \"Lluchia Dy Ffachlwch Drosda I\" (\"Throw Your Flashdust Over Me\") reveals a strong belief in music's redemptive powers: According to Gruf Rhys's liner notes and translations, it's about \"the realization that the Earth is a flop and that sometimes the only friend we can turn to is dumb rhyming pop music.\" Thirteen years after the band's dissolution, their music holds up surprisingly well, especially considering all we have to judge it by are 16 \"lost songs,\" as the subtitle dubs them. Despite being one of the most recent songs on the album, the opener \"Valium\" starts with an 1980ssounding drum machine that screams \"Cardiff Vice\", but most tracks don't seem to have aged much. Some are singleworthy gems, like \"Segur Sega\" (\"Lazy/Redundant Sega\") and \"Arwynebol Melyn\" (\"Yellow Superficial Pony\"). Others, like \"Hydref yn Sacramento\" (\"The Fall in Sacramento\"), go on and on without having much going on at all, suggesting a young band that didn't have full control yet over its own creative powers. It's easy to pick out the similarities between Ffa Coffi Pawb and their direct progeny, especially Super Furry Animals that's unmistakably Rhys's voice delivering those consonantheavy lyrics, and that soaring threenote harmony on \"Segur Sega\" and those dreamy nananas on \"Breichiau Hir\" (\"Long Arms\") are prototype elements of the bouncy boogie of Radiator and Guerilla. As a result, it's now difficult to hear Ffa Coffi Pawb as its own distinct entity, but rather as the leadup to other bands. Maybe those four \"lost\" albums tell a different story. "}
