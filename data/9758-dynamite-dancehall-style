Dancehall Style","text":" It was only a matter of time before Soul Jazz got around to focusing on dancehall. Though the label has released great collections of Panamanian funk and free jazz obscurities and primeval New York hiphop and glittering and gaudy Tom Moulton disco mixes and chilly Brazilian postpunk and early acid house and sweet Philly soul (you get the idea), they're perhaps best known for their devotion to Jamaican music, from ska to, now, ragga. Most of their Studio One series of compilations, collating a variety of themed cuts from the venerable reggae label, are worth owning, and they've put out a string of solid single artist LPs. But the label's most seductive point of entry to Jamaican music has been their 100% Dynamite series, a mix of tunes almost anyone with a cursory interest in reggae knows and a few deep pocket obscurities to keep heads scratching. Ragga had shown up on the 100% Dynamite records since the third installment where Wayne Smith's epochal 1980s burial tune \"Under Mi Sleng Teng\" bumped up against dub cuts from the late 70s and ska from the 60s; later installments featured Bounty Killer, Red Rat, Tiger Ranks refixing \"The Real Slim Shady\", and a 21st century version of \"Under Mi Sensi\". But Dynamite! Dancehall Style is the first Soul Jazz compilation to feature exclusively dancehall, stretching from predigital deejay chat tunes to modern computerassisted, hiphopsaturated gangsta records to a few nonJamaican mutations. All mixed up nonchronologically, of course a crossgenerational and crosscontinental meeting of the minds. For modern dancehall fans accustomed to sparklingly recorded handclaps, Burundi drums, country banjos, psychedelicized ProTools touches, and 3D gunshots, the hissy, lofi production on many Dynamite! Dancehall Style cuts may take a few spins to acclimate to. Early B's \"Boombox\" and Dillinger's \"Dubplate Pirate\" were recorded with inelastic drum machines and dippitydoo keyboard basslines born with \"Sleng Teng\" and its 1985 Casio approximation of a rolling Eddie Cochran guitar riff with their producers playing around with the echo knobs and layering vocals up and down in the background. Even beefed up on Powerman's 2003 \"Right Yah So\", that \"Sleng Teng\" bassline is charmingly cheesy, totally infectious, and cartoonishly effective as a hook.  Like Mantronixera hiphop, this stuff still sounds great. (Especially since I wasn't there at the time to experience either.) On the chorus of Anthony \"Red\" Rose's \"Tempo\" one of the big smashes from a revitalized, digitalera King Tubby the producer throws crude digital reverb on the singjay's voice, making Rose sound some o.g. \"Battlestar Gallactica\" villain over an ultraminimal riddim. (And dig how much of a delicious reverbed smack Tubby gets out of his rigid mechanical drums on the later \"Fade Out\".) That kind of ticking hypnosis is all over the earliest cuts on Dynamite! Dancehall Style, as producers who were well versed with swirling human drummers through the echo chamber relearned their trade on boxes with little in the way of give or swing or sway. Even the newer cuts, like Lady Saw's 2003 \"Mi Ting Deh\" recorded in an era where garage bands use Garage Band keep things spare and deadly. And as for the British interlopers, the shuddering, shivering synthetic bassline on dubsteppers Digital Mystikz's \"Earth a Run Red\" owes as much to \"Sleng Teng\" as it does to Wiley's \"Igloo\" and \"Blizzard\". (For instrumentals, though, the Mystikz are unsurprisingly cut here by reggae legend Sly Dunbar's steel drumdriven \"Wake the Town\" and eerie \"Assault Rifle.\")  Likewise, the deejaying on many of the cuts may sound archaic at first, taking off on the biddlyzungazangabong style of onomatopoeic scat pioneered by chatters like Barrington Levy, EekAMouse, and Yellowman or the almost peaksandvalleysfree delivery of early digital deejays, sounding like they're trying to out John Henry their drum machines. Pompidou's \"Governor General\" opens with the croakyvoiced MC repeating \"general\" about 15 times in a row, as well as devoting special attention to how he can juggle the words \"jigglyiggly\" (or is it \"igglyjiggly\"?) and gargling other phrases a few dozen times each. (At least that's what I hear.) Robert Christgau may have said that Kleenex/Lilliput had the best collection of vocal nonsensicals since doowop but dancehall deejays might give the Swiss ladies a run for their money. In contrast, Shinehead's slow, skanking, reverential take on MJ's \"Billie Jean\" feels slightly out of place here, maybe only \"dancehall\" by dint of having been released in the '80s. That inclusion and a few other tracks mean that as any sort of dancehall primer, Dynamite! Dancehall Style is too flighty and a bit too obscure in places to really work, but as a kickass mixtape put together by your cool, intheknow friends at Soul Jazz, it's pretty much a treat from end to end.
