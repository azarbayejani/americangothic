But up on the Other Stage, Rocket From the Crypt are looking like a million bucks (or, roughly Â£500,000). Halfway through their set, John \"Speedo\" Reis parts the crowd and challenges the more daring members of the audience to use the empty space as a mud slide; after five minutes of watching inebriated Englishmen hurtle themselves face down into the brown, Reis stops midsong, flashes a shiteating grin a mile wide, and announces, \"Ladies and gentlemen, if we have learned anything here today, it's that you can dive face first into pig shit, and still not be famous.\" Sadly, for Rocket From the Crypt, you could haul ass for 15 years, release 11 albums, and even get Interscope to pay for two of them, and still be only slightly more famous than a bunch of British knuckleheads swimming in mud. But then Rocket From the Crypt were early 1990s punks who operated much like an indie rock band circa now, releasing a seemingly inexhaustible supply of quality singles and EPs at a clip that hearkened the current postblog deemphasis on the album, while their atomic fusion of Springsteen and the Stooges foreshadowed indie rock's nowperfunctory Boss worship. But where so many contemporary indie rock bands pay lipservice to Bruce's allAmerican authenticity, RFTC were more proponents of the E Street bigband theory, favoring breathless, soulrevuestyled set lists, titanic blasts of brass, and only the most selfaggrandizing stage banter. So it's fitting that when the San Diego sextet announced their final show on Oct. 31 2005 as per their tradition of Halloween homecoming shows the venue of choice was not a local punkrock landmark like the Casbah, but rather the ballroom in the Westin Horton Plaza Hotel. However, as lastshow documents go, the CD/DVD package R.I.P. arriving perhaps two years too late, but just in time to herald the arrival of Reis' new band, the Night Marchers is determinedly low on sentimentality. It's hard to get too choked up when you've got El Vez reading your eulogy (\"they were so young!\"), and Reis taking the stage dressed as Screaming Jay Hawkins complete with nose bone to warm up with a goofy riff on \"I Put a Spell On You\". But after this awkwardly stagy intro Reis admits himself it's \"long, boring and [goes] nowhere\" in the entertainingly nobullshit liner notes it's all business. \"We invented this type of music,\" Reis declares six songs in, \"it's called rock'n'roll.\" He's half right: What RFTC really do is rock'n'roar you don't so much listen to songs like \"Boychucker\" and \"Don't Darlene\" as brace yourself for their ribbruising onslaught of sax and violence. The chainfight menace is reinforced by the fact that R.I.P.'s careerspanning setlist is stacked with onetwo punches pulled sequentially from the original albums: \"I'm Not Invisible\"/\"Get Down\" (from 2002's Live From Camp XRay), \"Light Me\"/\"A+ in Arson Class\" (1995's The State of Art Is on Fire EP), \"Middle\"/\"Born in '69\" (1995's Scream, Dracula, Scream!). Like all great prizefighters, Rocket give you nary a second to figure out what hit you before hitting again.  The 51minute CD portion of R.I.P. features only part of the full 95minute set documented in grainy digital video on the DVD, and with good reason: this chaotic concert is marked by the sort of intrusions a tossed plastic gun to Reis' head during \"Jumper K. Balls,\" an overeager stage diver derailing \"Carne Voodoo\" midsong that make for more interesting viewing than listening. But you still have to question some of the editing choices: a meatslabtough version of Hot Charity's \"My Arrow's Aim\" doesn't make the album cut at the expense of momentumcurbing selections like \"Shy Boy\" and \"Velvet Touch\" (both from 1991's Paint as a Fragrance), and while the CD omission of RFTC's one altrock semihit, \"On a Rope\" suits the band's contrarian attitude (says Reis in the liners, \"[it's] the song that will forever be our piss stain on the footnotes of underground 90s rock lore...I still get checks for $13.92 every year. In some parts of the world I can buy an ox and fuck it for that price.\"), R.I.P. feels less like a definitive careercapper as a result. But such quibbles are forgotten by the time we hit the lateset airing of Circa: Now!'s triumphant grunge waltz \"Ditch Digger\", where, even without the benefit of a DVD, you can just picture the costumed crowd raising their arms to valiantly brandish those RFTC tattoos that can no longer be used to get into shows for free. Even in its dying moments, a Rocket From the Crypt show is no place to get all emotional, but if only for a few minutes, you just might confuse all that sweat for tears. "}
