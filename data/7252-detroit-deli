The Detroit trio of T3, Baatin, and Jay Dee managed to produce a phenomenal chestthumping debut fulllength, Fantastic, Vol. 2, two years before Em hit the silver screen. The record crystallized Unmah allstar Jay Dee's patented assrattling bump and established him as one of the hottest producers in the game. Unfortunately, after Jay Dee's departure in 2001, Slum Villa's sophomore release, Trinity: Past, Present and Future, left significant questions as to the group's longevity, despite notable production work by Bling 47 counterpart Waajid and promising returns from the duo BR Gunna. 2003 delivered more surprises when Baatin, Slum Vil's inhouse Rasputin, was diagnosed with schizophrenia after increasingly erratic behavior on tour and a twoday shark steakinduced coma. By 2004, hope was fading, deals were drying up, and the frequent lineup changes were wearing heavily on the remaining members.Detroit Deli, unfortunately, meets every expectation for a group as battleweary as Slum Village. Tag team producers Young RJ and Black Milk (aka BR Gunna) possibly could have offered the benefit of solid backbeats, but they themselves are still searching for finesse. Tracks like the 80s fauxfunk of \"Do You\" and the Egyptian twist of \"Things We Do\" bear hints of hotness, but in the end only paraphrase J. Dilla's genius. Emphasizing beats over rhymes is purist anathema, but let's be honest: Elzhi, T3 and Baatin historically never have had the subtlety or dexterity to hold court by themselves. Even on Slum Village's debut, Jay Dee was the visionary, and the rest of the gang was playing catch up. Detroit Deli only emphasizes this disparity further: Baatin's sexistential ramblings are sorely missed; T3 has yet to push past his own penis; and Elzhi drops some flatout trash verses, as on \"Count the Ways\": \"You're screamin' in our semen/ We get done.\" On the opening volley, \"Zoom\", T3, Elzhi and Detroit counterpart Phat Kat stumble like amateurs at the 106 & Park tryouts: \"Catch me in Range with the rims, spinnin'/ Spinnin', sorta lookin' like its windmillin'.\" Even WuTang fugitive Dirt McGirt comes off lazy on his feature track \"Dirty\", serving up the anthemic worst line of 2004 and a surefire ladyslayer: \"If you're flexible, intellectual, bisexual/ Can I get next to you?\" Despite its many shortcomings, Deli manages a few brilliant moments. On Kanye West's addition \"Selfish\", Slum Village enlists the help of neoneosoul crooner John Legend to create a simply ephemeral R&B; cut (although I wonder if Kanye's knack for homonyms on his verses is wearing thin). The baby'sbottom vibe on \"Closer\" displays an understated mesohorny romanticism few can match, and the inspirational \"Old Girl/Shining Star\" demonstrates Slum at its playful, gritty best. That Detroit Deli even exists as an album testifies to T3 and Elzhi's determination, but Slum Village's ambivalence prevents the record from the organic smoothness of days past. Without the production ethos of Fantastic, Deli only further complicates the group's turbulent history. On \"Reunion\", Jay Dee quips, \"You thought we broke up / But we were just reassemblin'\"; if they even survive to make a fourth album, Slum Village will need to find a better configuration. "}
