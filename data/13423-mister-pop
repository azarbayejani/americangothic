But if the New Zealand trio's output has been notoriously sporadic over their 32year lifespan, their releases have been fortuitously timed to capitalize on their unyielding influence: After a brief string of legendmaking singles in the early 1980s, the band's relatively prolific 199096 run coincided with the ascendance of Clean acolytes Pavement and Yo La Tengo; their last release, 2001's Getaway, dovetailed with the Strokes and the Shins' backtobasics ethos; while the new Mister Pop only their fifth fulllength release arrives at a time when a new generation of lofidelity allstars (Jay Reatard, Bradford Cox, Crystal Stilts, Love Is All) is displaying a voracious appetite for Kiwi pop.But the Clean have always exuded a casual grace that suggests they'd still be making the same records even if no one was listening, employing the same set of devices ramshackle locomotive rhythms, buoyant basslines, swirling organ lines, and widesmile melodies irrespective of prevailing fashions, technological developments, or geopolitical unrest. And yet, the Clean's periodic resurgences serve as a reminder that, in a world of uncertainty, there are still some things you can rely on.Despite the eightyear layoff since Getaway, Mister Pop effectively picks up right where we left off, with a pair of warmup exercises the metronomic organgrinding jam \"Loog\" and the possibly selfreferential dreampop ditty \"Are You Really on Drugs?\" that feel like vaportrail echoes of its predecessor's distended, psychedelic haze. Even in light of the Clean's lofi legacy, the tracks feel demograde, built on single ideas that, while lasting only three minutes each, still feel run into the ground, begging the question of whether eight years was actually long enough for the song reservoir to replenish itself again. But such quibbles are cast aside 30 seconds into \"In the Dreamlife You Need a Rubber Soul\", a headlightbright janglepop pleaser (possibly about the new Beatles reissues?) that boasts all the hallmarks of classic Clean. On another track, David Kilgour makes an even more explicit reinforcement of Mister Pop's returntoform intent: over a paisleytoned, modrock swing, he repeats, \"It puts me right back in the day.\"And so Mister Pop stays the course for the rest of its relatively compact 10song, 34minute length, reshaping the Clean's core components into poignant bossa nova instrumentals (\"Simple Fix\"), propulsive Krautrockouts (\"Tensile\") and, as only they can, bizarro fuzzorgan jigs that resemble White Light/White Heatera Velvets auditioning for \"Riverdance\" (\"Moonjumper\"). But whenever Mister Pop threatens to drift off, it's grounded by an aceinthehole strummer like \"Factory Man\", a GoBetweensworthy workingclasshero portrait that, rather than comment on the bluecollar life from an artist's distance, sees a kinship. \"He's a factory man/ And I'm no better than he 'cause I'm a factory man, too,\" Kilgour concludes. And after all these years, the Clean's assemblyline craftsmanship is as welloiled as ever. "}
