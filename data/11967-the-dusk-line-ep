These tracks don't quite fit into the fulllength's sonic scope, and on their own they constitute something of an enigma. They feature just vocalist Sian Ahern and Rupert Clervaux, who only plays the grand piano here. These songs aren't as fullbodied as those on 59:59; the minimalism of The Dusk Line both in its sparse instrumentation and its fascination with patterns and repetition suggests an unexpected quasiclassical base to the band's music.Earlier this year, in an interview with Anthem magazine attributed to the band as a whole, one member stated, \"There's more power in quiet/loud/quiet than just LOUD LOUD LOUD.\" They demonstrated that application of the Pixies Principle on their twothirds quiet debut LP. The Dusk Line EP shows that, along with dynamic shifts, the development of a song is something that's best demonstrated through repetition: The goal here is to draw out the hypnotic, subtle power of a single melody, a technique that aligns Sian Alice more closely with contemporary classical composers or the American minimalists of the 1960s than the shoegazers with whom they're often compared.\"October's Piano\" could be called \"October's Rain\" it begins with tinkling, dancing notes before it folds into the EP's twohanded trick: one hand repeats and paces on a rhythm, while the other hunts out melodies, giving the sensation of repetition and variation all at once. In fact \"Days Of Grace III\" appears on 59:59, as does \"When...\". Do these versions feel particularly connected? Not really. \"Days III\" has a ticking energy, part from its rhythm section, part from the chirping birds sampled in the background. Dusk Line's \"Days Of Grace II\" uses Ahern's long syllables to give the slow, rhythmic feeling of a bellows pumping. Ahern's voice also, in a sense, replaces the strings on 59:59's \"When...\". It takes a second to realize that her \"ohhhs\" on \"When...(Variation)\" isn't some otherworldly instrument. She adds in wordless sighs that trace one side of the piano melody, while the other side dances over a few patterns.Each song could almost blend into the next, such as when the title track's feline grace slinks into the respiratory repetitions of \"Days Of Grace II\". The record's brevity saves it from becoming a slog, then, as the combination of repetition and modulation starts to flatten out as it progresses. Were Sian Alice a more established band, this EP would be a \"fans only\" affair, not because it's bad or indulgent, but because it's stripped to the marrow, showing what Sian Alice would be without the horns and granite basslines. Without the context of 59:59, The Dusk Line becomes a kind of found object, fascinating for everything it doesn't disclose, but frustrating in its arbitrariness.Â  "}
