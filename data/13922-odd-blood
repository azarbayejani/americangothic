They carried an air of mystery and surprise, and at their best (\"2080\", \"Sunrise\") managed to make offbeat mysticism and offkilter pop music seem attractive and exciting. They were basically a rootsy, classic rockish version of MGMT then. Their fate seemed doubly sealed by \"Tightrope\", their laserfocused and damn near bestinshow contribution to the allstar charity compilation Dark Was the Night.Then they arguably topped that with \"Ambling Alp\", the prerelease single to sophomore album Odd Blood. \"Alp\" managed to retain the leftfield bona fides within an easytolove glassy pop sheen. That duality extended to the lyrics as well: The song is about infamous Italian boxer Primo Carnera, but in the chorus Chris Keating sang the kind of wholesome fatherly advice you might hear in a Shrek montage.Like \"Ambling Alp\", Odd Blood itself should appeal to a lot of people: Yeasayer have made a potentially vanguard record using the full range of possibilities of softwarebased music to create what once would have been radiofriendly rock. The elastic \"O.N.E.\" and the Tears for Fearsish \"I Remember\" are successful mid80s throwbacks, achieving the full potential hinted at on All Hour Cymbals and rivaling that album's best material. Opener \"The Children\" also works by tailoring their offbeat tendencies into a tightly packaged song. In much of the first half of the album, Yeasayer demonstrate a rare craftsmanship and consideration that's too often shoved under the rug in modern indie music. Their lyrics may not say much of anything, but their agile arrangements, sense of dynamics and pacing, and singer Chris Keating's expressive vocals communicate plenty.The rest of the album suffers from a major identity crisis few of the various farflung ideas it explores pan out, and most of them wind up overcooked. On the whole, the record alternates between a progrock version of 80s UK synthpop (and those are the good songs) and dreadlocky altpop or yuppieera world music imitations (aaaand... those are the bad ones). Songs like \"Rome\" or \"Love Me Girl\" aim for ambitious sprawl but just wind up muddy, while the ballads \"Strange Reunions\" and \"Grizelda\" seem plodding and congested. The more in need of editing the music gets, the weaker the lyrics become: \"Mondegreen\" is the worst offender, with Keating chanting \"Everybody's talking about me and my baby makin' love 'til the morning light\" ad nauseum over shamanistic electroboogie. (But you knew that I mean, everybody's talking about it.)Of course, Yeasayer aren't going anywhere: quality singles, inventive videos, and solid live performances go far. But it's hard to miss the pressure the band was under to deliver here it's nearly palpable in their overfed production and search for direction, and as a result, Odd Blood is a bit too much of not enough. I went back and listened to \"Tightrope\" again. It remains charming, human, and assured, winning your affection instead of trying to earn your respect. When Odd Blood succeeds, it does the same, but when it fails, it fails badly. "}
