Deusner","artist":"Big Star","title":"In Space","text":" This Big Star really isn't Big Star. Sure, it has two of the founding members, Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens, and it has two touring members, Jonathan Auer and Ken Stringfellow of the Posies. Sure, that's the same lineup that played on Big Star's last release, Columbia: Live at Missouri University 4/25/93, and that's the same lineup that's been touring on and off for years as Big Star. They've remained Big Star longer than any other of the other incarnations, but judging from the band's first album of new material the first bearing the name Big Star in nearly 30 years they sound more like the countless Big Star followers than Big Star.Band names are essentially brand names, especially in the case of Big Star, which took its moniker from a regional chain of grocery stores. That choice proved ironic: Despite critical acclaim and best efforts, the band never achieved any sort of stardom, but instead gradually became cult kings. For a band like Big Star to release a new album of original material 30 years after what most believed was their last is a calculated risk: It's sure to get people's attention, but it also threatens to devalue the brand. In Space isn't as terrible as internet chatter predicted. In fact, it's not really bad at all, even though it starts off aggressively mediocre. The opener \"Dony\" has Jim Spake's outofnowhere sax solo to enliven its midtempo pop, but Auer and Stringfellow's \"Lady Sweet\" and Stephens' \"Best Chance We've Ever Had\" lack any such flourish. \"Turn My Back on the Sun\" starts with a Beach Boys fakeout a toy piano melody and the words \"Wouldn't it...\", but \"be nice\" is replaced with \"surprise somebody to find.\" That's the lyrical highlight of In Space. Most other songs are full of banal sentiments (\"the sunlight in your hair seems to stop time\"), hoary cliches (\"Lady Sweet/ Looks like she can't be beat\"), and simplistic rhyme schemes. The band sounds hesitant and maybe uncommitted, and instead of conveying feelings, these first songs reveal a lack of ideas, suggesting that Big Star don't have much to say. It's not until \"Love Revolution\" that In Space begins to pick up a little. The song is so silly it's almost embarrassing a discolite anthem with shoutouts for allnight lovemaking and platform shoes. But at least it sounds like they're having fun. It kicks off a middle section that's a lively and energetic remedy to the songs that precede it. Stephens' \"February's Quiet\" is no revelation, but it's a sweet ode to making it through the cold months with the one you love. \"A Whole New Thing\", \"Do You Wanna Make It\", and their cover of the Olympics' \"Mine Exclusively\" bounce with a groove that recalls their former label's house band, Booker T. and the MGs, and the awkwardly charming \"Aria Largo\" sounds like the coolest wedding processional ever. But In Space ends on a dim note, with the mess that they've titled \"Makeover\". It's the inverse of \"Love Revolution\" a selfimpressed racket that's not even salvaged by its insistent bassline. Still, for all its bright spots, In Space is not much more than adequate power pop. It's hard to judge the album on its own terms and almost impossible to shake the fact that it would sound better with another band's name on the spine, one that didn't invite hopeless comparisons to #1 Record, Radio City, and Third/Sisters Lovers. For instance, In Space would be a decent Posies album, and there's enough for a passable Chilton solo joint, but as a Big Star release, it's inescapably disappointing. "}
