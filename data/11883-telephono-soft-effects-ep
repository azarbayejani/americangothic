{"label":" Matador","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/9109/homepage_large.04c0d578.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brian Howe","artist":"Spoon","title":"Telephono","text":" A decade after debuting on Matador, Spoon's first album Telephono and followup EP Soft Effects have been brought back into print by Merge, reminding us that while the Austin band's taut rhythms, spiky guitars, and jaded urbanity have always been with them, the starkly gestural rock they perfected on Kill the Moonlight was only attained by a gradual paring away of excesses. Telephono is more spastic than anything Spoon would record over the next 10 years, and it invoked a barrage of Pixies and Wire comparisons that dogged the band long after the group had hit upon their own distinctive sound. The Soft Effects EP finds Spoon roughing out the bold, blocky edges that would resolve into sharp focus on their later work. Thanks to Britt Daniel's vocal panache and durable songwriting, both albums hold up well.The most striking thing about hearing Telephono again, besides its raucous energy and massively serrated guitars, is how much it resembles early Pavement. Like an indie rock Helen of Troy, Pavement launched a thousand deliberately sloppy, apathetically brainy rock bands, and while Spoon may not have been directly influenced by them, it's certainly possible that Daniel was internalizing Slanted and Enchanted while writing Telephono whenever the guitars drunkenly reel or Daniel does funny stuff with his voice, the affinity, however coincidental, resounds.\"Don't Buy the Realistic\" opens in a tangle of squalling guitars and buried vocals before unkinking and straightening into one thrumming wire. On the ebbing \"Not Turning Off\", Daniel gradually lathers the refrain \"Oh honey, oh please, it's just a machine\" into a gibbering falsetto, then a shrill scream an undeniably wacky moment for a singer whose rep is built on laconic poise. But Spoon's always been an indie rock band for actual cool kids, while Pavement was for kids who thought being smart could somehow make you cool, and there's a confident concision to Telephono's wantonness. Jim Eno's percussion holds the shattered songs together like wire on a broken jaw; pillars of bass suddenly topple clear from chaotic ruins; Daniel's lyrics are aloof and proleptically dismissive, with an \"I pull more chicks than you\" smirk contrasting Malkmus' \"I've read more Chaucer than you\" variety of the same.Soft Effects finds Spoon in transition, and if \"mellowing\" isn't precisely the right term for it there's nothing mellow about the densely barbed fuzz of \"Get Out the State\", or the monolithic slabs of guitar punctuating the barren expanses of \"Mountain of Sound\" Telephono's relative volatility is replaced by deliberation, angling the band directly toward the jagged preMoonlight rock they honed on Girls Can Tell and A Series of Sneaks. Noisier tracks are counterbalanced by twitchy poprockers like the classic \"Waiting for the Kid to Come Out\", where Daniel roundly inflects like a selfassured Elvis Costello over a brightly convulsive rhythm that erupts into crunchy choruses.While they'd yet to achieve the almost Zenlike restraint that galvanized later recordings, Soft Effects finds Spoon well on their way, and remains a high point in their catalog by virtue of its blend of earlycareer vigor and budding aesthetic refinement. Historicallyminded listeners should find interest in hearing Spoon lay the sturdy foundation of an edifice that would become more spindly and baroque as it climbed. But context is entirely optional: These records remain, as always, more satisfying as sonic achievements than as documents of progress. "}
