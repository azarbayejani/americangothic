{"label":" Matinee","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/12954/homepage_large.19437be7.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"The Lucksmiths","title":"First Frost","text":" Indie pop, like other scenes outside rock's traditional canon, doesn't necessarily demand consistency. With a tradition of vinyl singles, small but beloved labels, and an intense sense of community, indie pop fans tend to place value on singles and EPs as much as albums. And with a decade and a half of reliably charming singles, EPs and, yes, albums the Lucksmiths are kind of like their genre's dependable goto; they're the Hold Steady of indie pop.You know what to expect from the Australian band's ninth album, First Frost, and as with Craig Finn & co.'s latest, Stay Positive, you also a get a few new wrinkles. Standup drummer Tali White sings a little bit softer now; the guitars crunch more often. But the songs written mostly by guitarist Marty Donald, though also by White, bassist Mark Monnone, and newer guitarist Louis Richter are still genial singalongs that bounce from languid introspection to scrappy exuberance. Covering familiar subjects like the weather, drinking, geography, and quiet melancholy, they delight with catchy tunes and understated eloquence. First Frost doesn't match the peaks of 2005's Warmer Corners or last year's 45track Spring a Leak compilation, but it comes close.Recorded in Tasmania with Chris Townend, the album continues a gradual sonic exploration: Horns and glamrock swagger help Donald's \"A Sobering Thought (Just When One Was Needed)\" clear its head, while an unexpectedly grinding guitar solo lets White's acoustic \"Up With the Sun\" move beyond \"a time when every lunch was breakfast.\" Monnone's \"SouthEast Coastal Rendezvous\" comes about as close to the wavy guitarscapes of Strawberry Wineera My Bloody Valentine as the Lucksmiths probably ever will, evocatively concluding, \"Here's to who knows what\" (alas, not \"when\"). Strings nicely adorn slower songs like Richter's opening \"The Town and the City\" and Donald's similarly themed \"Pines\". \"I don't mean to suggest I'm getting older/ But the city looks better over my shoulder,\" goes the latter.If it sounds like the Lucksmiths that wrote happygolucky songs like \"Under the Rotunda\" and \"TShirt Weather\" have grown up...well, they have, but their craft has matured, too. They still \"drink and laugh and eat,\" as on Monnone's folkier, slightly drab \"Day Three of Five\". Only now they're left to ask themselves, \"Why did you get drunk\" in Donald's mournful, countrytinged duet with female vocalist Bee Rigby, \"Lament of the Chiming Wedgebill\". No, wait, it's the chiming wedgebill who's asking.Most admirably, First Frost finds the Lucksmiths continuing to put out quietly ambitious records that could be enjoyed by almost anybody who loves music not just indie pop partisans. \"California in Popular Song\" is the best song on the album, but it's not a difficult critic's favorite; either you'll love the trebly guitar interplay, White's tender phrasing, Donald's vivid storytelling about someone leaving for an imagined California, and delicate turns of phrase like \"your eyes are wet with wine,\" or you'll listen to something else. Yes, I realize the poetically arranged SATword singalong that ends Donald's gorgeous \"The National Mitten Registry\" is waaay too precious for the Hot 100. But as White sings: \"Fingers crossed/ All is not lost.\" The Lucksmiths still drink; they haven't dried up, and it doesn't sound like they're going to crumble into dust anytime soon. "}
