{"label":" Death Row","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/9005/homepage_large.30468fa8.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Sean Fennessey","artist":"Dr. Dre","title":"Death RowÂ’s Greatest Hits: The Chronicles","text":"  Lavishing Andre Young with praise is like getting worked up over filet mignon. You're not going to impress anybody with description and deification. Dr. Dre didn't just reconfigure rap music with The Chronic, he played perhaps the largest role in making it the most viable form of American popular music this century. What's gotten lost in the writing of his legacy is the slight devolution his most successful period marked. As much as GFunk set the post80s generation ablaze sidling up to the table less than a year after Nirvana's Nevermind began dominating the consciousness it leaned too heavily on George Clinton's twodecade old cosmic slop. And for all of Snoop Doggy Dogg's liquid cool (anyone else miss that Doggy?), there was always Dre's hyperclunky delivery. Still, there's no denying the immensely decadent, trunkrattling pseudoreality of his best Death Rowera output. This 15song set is the second Dr. Dre compilation this decade, following 2002's similarly titled Chronicles: Best of the Works, and it struggles to match the comprehensive assemblage of 1996's Death Row Greatest Hits. This one, however, leans far more heavily on Snoop, eliciting four tracks from Doggystyle and one from the underestimated Tha Doggfather. Snoop's a cipher nowadays, awash in product placement's goop, but the armchair funk of \"Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)\" is as funny and flagrant as ever. Rank misogyny in hiphop wasn't news at this point, but damn, did Nate Dogg take it to romantic extremes on that track. Elsewhere, \"Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')\" and Lady of Rage's \"Afro Puffs\" sound aggressive as ever, where Dre and the Lady spit invective over that signature West Coast ping and kickingadeadbody snare. The major hits, especially \"Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang\", hold up, but the Leon Haywoodsampling skeleton reveals a song that rode to prominence on the strength of Snoop's elegant discourse (\"But, uhh, back to the lecture at hand/ Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand\") more than originality of production. Still, Dre has mastered so many styles over the years, from N.W.A.'s soullaced nihilism to Eminem's carnivalbarking circus themes to 50 Cent's megalomaniacal street semantics to the ultrasheen of Gwen Stefani r&b. His Death Row tracks are his most iconic, without question, but feel more about purpose and personality than sonic clarity. No one wants to rate Jesus' miracles, but I mean, c'mon, making the blind guy see was more meaningful than watertowine, wasn't it?  Really, they're all gems, but two shine extra bright: Dre's reunion with Ice Cube, \"Natural Born Killaz\", actually foretold the chaotic slams of Dre's best album, the overwhelmingly precise 2001; and the 2Pac collaboration \"California Love (Remix)\" features the littleheard, nearly twominute vocoder solo from Roger Troutman, one of Dre's forebears. The solo is chillinducing, stretched out longer than it has to be, punctuating one of rap's most extravagant songs with a finale full of grandeur and, dare I say, gravitas.  There are only a handful of songs here that even the most casual fan of rap nay, popular music won't own. But as a playlist, Chronicles lacks any thematic connotations. It certainly works as Gangsta Shit 101 and nudges everyone, again, about Death Row's frozenintime prominence. It also reminds listeners that the label didn't really have much going for it musically aside from Dre's (and later Dat Nigga Daz's) production. As Dre has aged and attempted to maintain his grasp on screwfaced gangsta lean, his output has taken a turn for the absent. It's been a struggle, as Dre the family man is clearly no longer Dre the \"I will kill EazyE if I see him in public\" thug. He may never have been. Take a peek at some pictures from his days in the electrofunk squad, the World Class Wreckin' Cru sometimes I wonder if he still tries on that shiny suit. So, as his longrumored Detox angles with Chinese Democracy for most overhyped Neveruary arrival and heads get antsy, there will always be compilations like this to insist things are not like it was then. Maybe.  "}
