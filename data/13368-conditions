But even in an age of instant global communication, Australia is still pretty far away from most of the rest of us. So when this Melbourne rock foursome with stadiumsized ambitions first landed in my inbox last October, it was a modest revelation. Curtis Vodka, Alaska's remixer extraordinaire, was pushing all the right techtextural buttons on an epic reworking of \"Sweet Disposition\", a majestic anthem which, if annoyingly derivative, had \"mainstream hit\" written all over it. Listeners who Shazam'd the original after hearing it in ads for Sky Sports TV in the UK or, stateside, on the trailer and soundtrack to altemo romcom (500) Days of Summer probably know the feeling.Hemispheric differences may have given the Temper Trap room to develop their radiofriendly sound without getting pushed prematurely into the spotlight (for real: sorry, Black Kids), but otherwise their debut album could've been made just about anywhere. Conditions is one for the Coldplay set all tightly executed grandiosity and U2 pedals, generally with pounding drums, soaring vocals about steadfastness or mortality or whatever, one rumbling bass note per arpeggiated guitar chord, and a modest drizzling of synths. Unfortunately, when you adopt the trappings of revolutionary significance without showing much interest in advancing beyond the revolutions of 20 years ago, you sound ridiculous. Southern conservatives are super concerned about racial discrimination now, you guys.Defined by almost any measure except musical creativity or lyrical ingenuity, the Temper Trap are a lot better than I'm making them sound. Dougie Mandagi's virtuosic falsetto is the kind of instrument that should come with a moneyback JeffBuckleycomparison guarantee. When Mandagi comes in, over ecclesiastical keyboard stabs and handclaps on opener \"Love Lost\", there's a brief glimmer of hope Conditions will end up being more like TV on the Radio, with all that New York group's restless adventurousness, than, um, whichever band we gave that \"U.2\" rating. His bandmates are no slouches, either, as instrumental finale \"Drum Song\" shows. If its jagged rhythmic attack owes something to Arctic Monkeys, then it's no coincidence producer Jim Abbiss also helmed the brainy Brits' fateful debut, along with albums for Kasabian, Adele, and others.What the Temper Trap do devastatingly well is drape postofficeparty mistakehookup tackiness in the lofty imagery of global struggle. You can just picture Mandagi standing on a mountaintop for \"Sweet Disposition\", his hair blowing in Bono's wind, but remember, ladies: Some insincere sketchball with limited imagination is going to use this to try to get you to have sex with him. \"Just stay there/ 'Cause I'll be coming over,\" Mandagi booms. \"Won't stop to surrender.\" Well, love is a battlefield, right?Elsewhere, the Temper Trap's pairing of sweeping portentousness with mundane douchebaggery is trickier to overlook. \"I pledge myself allegiance to a battle not to sleep at home,\" Mandagi clarifies on another single, the reasonably catchy uptempo electrorocker \"Fader\". Synthdripping slow jam \"Fools\" adds, \"I want it, I want it, I want it,\" amid rebukes to unnamed, uhh, fools. Cold War Kidsish indie nod \"Down River\" pulls out all the orchestral, choral, and vaguely baptismal flourishes in Neon Bible's book to repeat, \"Go, don't stop.\" And remember \"Love Lost\"? It adapts a line from \"Amazing Grace\" into a request to \"flash your heart.\" Yeah, open up your shirt and ohhh. One more in the name of love: Latest UK single \"Science of Fear\" samples Robert F. Kennedy's famous remarks on the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. I take it Mandagi still hasn't found what he's looking for.It's telling to learn where, in fact, the Temper Trap did come from. The first thing producer Abbiss apparently heard from the band was a demo of \"Soldier On\", Conditions' Muserific nadir. Mandagi tells the BBC, \"His wife really liked it so apparently they had a moment together and out of obedience to his wife Jim decided to record us.\" The sixminute track moves from Graceful guitar and falsetto into gnashing progrock bombast, until Mandagi is seriously howling at \"death.\" I'm gonna assume he means the little one what the French call \"la petite mort.\" "}
