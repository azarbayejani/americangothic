If your camp counselor were telling a ghost story and this guy jumped out at you at the end, there is no doubt that you would wet yourself. If you were eight. The new album from the Bay Area's Dead and Gone, The Beautician, is the first release since Baker quit and rejoined the band. While he was gone the other members formed a separate group, Creeps on Candy, and it's easy to see especially from their work that Baker is what makes this outfit, putting a face to the horrorshow mood and pulplike lyrics. And this is pulp in the best sense of the word: the imagery is wittily imaginative, so much so that I didn't even need to be told that \"Towers on Fire\" wasn't a mockery of the Twin Towers disaster (\"See the flames through the windows... And we are the walking dead\"); I already guessed that they chose such gruesome lyrics just because they sound cool. In fact, the lyrics are littered with cartoonish horrors \"Rats as Big as Rats\" is particularly notable for the lines, \"Drinking all my liquor like a pack of politicians/ RATS RATS RATS RATS!\" The album's best track is another reflexively titled song, \"Leave the Dead to Bury the Dead\". Baker's stay in a crummy hotel room, abandoned by a girl, becomes an epic dirge. He turns the squalid imagery into a vision of hell, sinking from \"there's nothing on TV\" to \"you're allergic to your own skin/ She won't call back,\" before he hits rock bottom: \"And dust is dust/ And Christ just keeps on dying.\" Depending on how you read it, this could be the best song about posthotelmasturbation guilt ever written. All thirteen songs are solid so solid, in fact, that few of them stand up and make a difference, melding into a half hour of steady dirgecore. But there's enough invention on the fringes to keep the momentum (the interludelike \"Ultimate Remote Control Toy\", for instance, has a great burst of synths) and guitarist Rockey Crane plays grinding chords and arch lines with restrained but perfect color. On tracks like \"Towers on Fire\", he bashes the ground and then slices through with a high staccato melody; when he slows down, his lines chime through the doom. The rhythm section (bassist Brian Stern and drummer Joey Perales) is reliably heavy, too.The Beautician is Dead and Gone's third album, following two that were produced by Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong. I conveniently left that fact to the end, so that any of you who are too indiehip to get near a Green Dayrelated hardcore band could give this one a fair hearing: the anticommercial, roughedged production, perfectly controlled mood and terrific lyrics make the music entertaining beyond the mosh pits. It's recommended to anyone who wants a good album to scowl with. "}
