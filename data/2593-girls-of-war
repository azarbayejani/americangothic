Big Black EPs, Flipper's \"Sex Bomb\", and No New York are convenient but unrealized inspirations: Drummer Chris (first name only, plz) pounds the toms but the smoke never rises, screamster slash guitarist Brace Pain runs his fingers haphazardly up and down the fretboard, and saxophonist Nate who apparently plays without a reed or lips fidgets nervously until Brace gives him the nod to make some noise. A few beats in, Brace starts demanding destroy all rats before suddenly ending the song with a 20second instrumental shitstorm. Congrats, Batss, you just cut Track 6. Noiserocking Hammerhead guitarist Paul Sanders notveryfamously said: \"I remember sometimes when I felt like when we played it was like surfing a big sonic wave. That's the feeling I associate with 'noise'. When it worked, it was transcendent. When it didn't, it was just difficult and annoying.\" A third adjective Sanders could include is \"boring\": And Girls of War despite how loud, fast, and artfully seatofpants it wants to seem is exactly that. No one's expecting straightforward hooks from a grooveoriented noise band (Die Monitr Batss insist they're not dancepunk), but something needs to sustain the listener's interest. Hooks in noise and no wave aren't exhausted: check recently the hypnotic chant of Liars' \"Broken Witch\", or that throbbing, condensed bass line of Wolf Eyes' \"Stabbed in the Face\". Die Monitr Batss, on the other hand, indiscriminately hurl up chunks of sound, hoping that something sticks. On \"Heatersss\", a microcosm of the entire album's fallacy, Pain exhibits the same instrumental banalities that hampered the music of his other band The Gossip. The track starts promising; a spastic Primus bass pattern pops under scrawling pick scrapes, pausing briefly for subtle guitar harmonics. Suddenly though Pain begins his drivel \"He said he never wants to see you again/ Turn on the heater, I'm freezing\" and the band resorts to punk guitar clich√©s like octave riffing and legato bends, ending the song in a diarrheic mess of more pick scrapes and thoughtless highhat fills. While some of the album's finer moments reflect the fractured, primitive stylings of DNA (\"White Shock\") or the lugubrious breakdowns of early Sonic Youth [\"Catholic Guilt (At Night)\"], the vast majority of Girls of War suffers from immature lyrics, punk gimmicks that masquerade as meaningful musical confrontation and spelling errors.
