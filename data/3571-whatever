{"label":" Music Man","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/3536/homepage_large.238f0eaf.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Paul Cooper","artist":"Green Velvet / Pajo","title":"Whatever","text":" Green Velvet, techhouse's premier whackjob, is back from another strange realm. Previously, Green Velvet had regaled the world with his tales of being a toothless inbred victim of alien abduction who lost his anal virginity at the hands of his alien captors (\"Abduction\"), as well as Zoloft fantasies about being an immortal water molecule (\"Water Molecule\"). He's also previously made public \"Answering Machine,\" a week's worth of answering machine messages during the course of which he's dumped by his fianc√©e who's also pregnant by some other guy, his landlord is throwing him out on the street for the racket he makes, and his best friend has stolen his primo stash. No small wonder Green Velvet rages after each message, \"I can't take this shit.\" \"Answering Machine\" was later remixed to bigroombuckling glory by edgy house masters, XPress 2. For the followup to the 1999's Constant Chaos and the F111 selftitled singles compilation, Green Velvet drops the chrome gleam of tech house and scoops up some filthy Teutonic electroagitpunk. Never as distorted and sloganslinging as Atari Teenage Riot, Whatever is assuredly aggro. Unlike the comfortably removed scifi of Constant Chaos, Whatever is altogether more downtoearth and soiling. You don't have to be a skank to get off on this record, but if you are, it will assuredly assist your acclimatization to Green Velvet's funky ordure. After declaring that he's a genetic defect on \"Genedefekt,\" \"La La Land\" returns to the wanton haunts of naughty girls and boys that Green Velvet exposed on his 1995 debut single, \"Flash.\" For his debut, Green Velvet took club kids' parents on guided tours of skeevy raves and encouraged the outraged, middleaged delusionals to take photographs with the exhortation, \"Cameras ready! Prepare to Flash.\" \"La La Land\" offers stern warnings about \"those little pills\" and the unreal \"thrills that they yield\" and the million brain cells that each pill kills. Underneath the manic preacher warnings, Green Velvet slides a demonic Euro electro track similar to the snarling crunky joints International Deejay Gigolos or Felix Da Housecat release. On \"Stranj,\" Green Velvet flips into a more Giorgio Moroderderived, techtrance mode for his exposition on how strange his world is after drugs and how his family is pressuring him to be an upstanding member of society, rather than the nightfilth freak he really is. \"Sleepwalking\" is an earnest and heavily processed tribute to Cabaret Voltaire's 1985 masterpiece of the same name. Though Green Velvet adds his unique lyrics, everyone whose adored Cabaret Voltaire's song will love the spindly fournote melody figure and the cowbell breakdown. Green Velvet reserves most of his rage for \"GAT (The Great American Tragedy),\" which he defines as people's willingness to be told what to do. Green Velvet screams, \"They say it's a phase/ This is not a fucking phase,\" over a sympathetically militant searing gabba rhythm. Following the musical diary entry song, \"Waiting 4 the Day 2 End,\" in which Green Velvet informs us that he wanted grits with his salted scrambled eggs for breakfast that morning, \"Dank\" closes Whatever with Green Velvet portraying four reeferjerks. Almost a cappella, \"Dank\" leaves the listener perplexed as to Green Velvet's nonarcotics sincerity. Since Green Velvet is a mask that musician Curtis Jones disguises his humanity in so that he can take longstay excursions beyond the bizarre, no one should be surprised if they feel creeped out or sullied at the end of the album.
