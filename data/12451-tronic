{"label":" Fat Beats","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/12963/homepage_large.f16e0312.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Black Milk","title":"Tronic","text":" Blame it on trickledown economics, but things just ain't the same for superproducers not only have guys like Timbaland, Pharrell, and Kanye stuck with the steadier pop/R&B dollar (or priced themselves out of hiphop), you'd be hardpressed to find any of the upandcomers who could truly go multimedia (though it's not for Polow da Don's lack of effort). Which leaves Black Milk on something of a singular plane he's just a super producer (and MC) with an album mindset, and Tronic just might be his boldest statement yet, far exceeding the modest nature of its Fat Beats origin.In fact, Tronic could very well be the best endtoend production job you've heard all year. It's hard to talk about anything Black Milk does without evoking J. Dilla, but even though there's a blatant nod here to the structure of Midnight Marauders, I'm hearing a real ATLiens vibe in the gorgeous, almost dubby undertow to the lunar sonics. The album cover is no ruse, as this is the most electro of Milk's productions, but he combines clubby textures and warm EQing in a way that begs for headphone listening even at its hardest knock. So the \"Knight Rider\" bassline of \"Bounce\" is counterbalanced by swirling, psychedelic keys and what initially sounds like an accordion on \"Tronic Summer\" turns out to be a sweltering vocoder.Though in no way a concept album, Tronic is meant to be consumed whole and some of the interstitial moments are the most rewarding \"Losing Out\" tumbles into an erratic drum'n'bass beat reminiscent of the Roots' \"You Got Me\", while the sprightly strings that take up the final 20 seconds of \"Hell Yeah\" feel like a lost treasure. This is a Black Milk album, so you know the drums are going to hit hard, but a lot of tracks sound like he's imported \"Tekken\" combos into his MPC. There often isn't a traditional earworm beyond the way Milk interacts with his beats \"Give the Drummer Sum\" features a Quasimotolike chant on the chorus, but the real hook is how Milk pulls tricks like dropping out the drums on the line \"let the organ get a stab at it.\" He practically lives inside the beats, and \"Try\" is something of a conversation with a soul sample from an artist who promised to stay away from them (a concession similar to Kanye's intro on \"Everything I'm Not\").But if you're wondering why that number up there isn't higher, well, here's the thing I'd hate to give Milk more reason to get defensive about his mic skills, since far too much of Tronic is muddled by saber rattling over haters who doubt his flow. First off, exactly which corner of the internet spends its time hating on Black Milk? Moreover, he's more than nice with his, considering that if he learned anything from Dilla, it's how to make electronically based hiphop jiggle organically. That's some pretty bumpy mixed meter terrain he's able to traverse on songs like \"Hold It Down\" and \"Overdose\".While he's every bit as thoughtful about his penmanship as he is about his production, Milk is nowhere near as adventurous. As was the case with Popular Demand and even the split he did with Fat Ray from earlier this year, you get the odd feeling that Milk put his heart into his work, and yet it feels slightly impersonal, save for the career summary \"Long Story Short\". Beyond his battle rhyming, he most frequently rails against the current state of hiphop, but his lines are so vague that they actually fail to indict anyone. Even while the kissoff of hangerson \"Without U\" resembles Slum Village at its most softbatch, the topicality, at least, is welcome. Tronic usually finds Milk's humility working in his favor, however, since he has no qualms about being a facilitator. Royce Da 5'9\" breaks hiphop's silence on Kwame Kilpatrick and absolutely shreds \"Losing Out\", and \"The Matrix\" is pure Soundbombing bait for those stuck in the onenineninenine: a reinvigorated Primo scratches while Milk trades verses with a typically oldman strength 16 from Sean P and Pharaohe Monch dropping a spectacular dud of a punchline likely causing agita at a message board near you (\"Like pants legs around the ankles of hipsters I'm tight!\")Unfortunately, it makes me think back to something Wale spoke to on \"The Perfect Plan\" \"Instead of singing our praise they do/ Raise the bar to a level unattainable.\" But it's to Black Milk's credit that so much is expected out of him. Maybe he's got the Detroit Chronic in him something with Elzhi (where's he?), Royce, and fuck, who's Eminem getting beats from these days? but for now, Tronic is one hell of a holding pattern.  "}
