On the night of September 11, 2001, Anderson was performing at the Park West in Chicago. The air was heavy with dread, confusion, and anger. Waiting for the show to begin, the crowd was talking amongst itself, conversations running the gamut between those three poles. Anderson herself had allegedly spent much of the morning on the phone with her partner Lou Reed, who was back in New York and supposedly sitting on the roof of their building watching the Twin Towers burn though she made nary a mention of the day's events once she started performing. The crowd was dead silent throughout, but when Anderson began \"O Superman\" you could hear the room shift as the already menacing song took on new layers of eerily contemporary meaning. \"Hello? Is anybody home? Well, you don't know me, but I know you. And I've got a message to give to you. Here come the planes. So you better get ready.\" The lyrics chimed out like an answering machine message sent to the future, picked up several decades too late.  That song's mix of politics, Zenlike aphorism, and sentimentalism hit like a punch to the gut as the nation stood on the precipice of the unknown, and the toll the collapse of the Twin Towers would truly take on this country and the world hadn't quite settled in. So: \"suddenly?\" No, surely Anderson recognized the renewed power of her (sole) unlikely hit well before she made it home to New York City. Then again, the almost mystically timeless song was in a way always about the shifting \"present.\" Anderson writes that \"O Superman (For Massenet)\" was inspired by a composition from Jules Massenet's opera Le Cid, \"O Souverain\", which in turn reminded Anderson of Napoleon's fall at Waterloo. She had also taken into account the bungled U.S. rescue mission in Tehran. It's a song of military arrogance, failure and the price we all pay, recorded for a modest $500 with an NEA grant. In 1981, it went to No. 2 in the UK.Big Science comprises songs from Anderson's also quite prescient United States project, a multimedia performance art piece cum opera (\"It seemed like everyone I knew was working on an opera,\" she recalls) that depicted America on the brink of digital revolution and capitalist nirvana, where the dollar trumped tradition and the apocalypse cultural, political, technological loomed large. In fact, given its themes and presentation, much of Big Science sounds every bit about \"the present\" as \"O Superman\" does, and its idiosyncratic execution (with stylistic nods to the minimalists and pal William S. Burroughs) has helped the disc weather the passage of time remarkably well. It's less a document of the early 1980s than it is a dark glimpse of the future recorded at the dawn of the Reagan era.  Anderson's ingenious move, musically, was utilizing the vocoder not as a trick but as a melodic tool. It's the first thing you hear on Big Science, looped in \"From the Air\" like some bizarre manmachine synth. The rest of the track revolves around a circular pattern of blurted sax figures and hypnotic drums. There's virtually nothing about it that screams its age as Anderson intones a wry announcement from a (caveman) pilot of a plummeting flight. \"There is no pilot,\" she speaks. \"You are not alone. Standby. This is the time. And this is the record of the time.\" It's a metaphor for every frightening thing about 20th (and now 21st century) living you can think of, and in its spare way it's enough to scare you silly.  The gloomy ghost town futuremusic of the title track sounds like the rueful ruminations of someone who sees the end of the world on the horizon and can't help but to chuckle a little at their impending doom. The austere soundscapes of \"Walking & Falling\" and \"Born, Never Asked\" convey a similar chilliness laced with a despair at once aloof and oddly wistful. \"Example #22\" is like a Can/Yoko/Eno chopshop, its funky wordless denouement part chant, part celebration of the absurd.  In fact, one of the elements that makes Big Science so special is Anderson's sense of humor. In \"Let X=X\", Anderson offers, with a wink, \"I can see the future, and it's a place about 70 miles east of here.\" It's a perverse punchline to some cosmic joke, and the human element back and forth of \"It Tango\" does little to dissipate the feeling that on Big Science it's the machines that are getting the last laugh at the expense of their masters. The future was yesterday. The future is now. Welcome to the future.   "}
