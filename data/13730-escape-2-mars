I wasn't sure whether to feel surprised, disappointed, or relieved, then, when I discovered that Escape 2 Mars sounds more or less exactly like a Blackalicious album.Whether or not you think this is a good thing probably depends entirely on your residual affection for early2000s Blackalicious records like Nia and Blazing Arrow. The sonic template is basically the same, with beats split evenly between the sort of moderately bumping soul/funk tracks designed to politely rattle your Prius trunk and languorous, vaguely dubby \"space funk\" explorations. Gift of Gab, still a technically astounding but painfully limited rapper, comes off far better on the former than on the latter. When he is called upon to shower you with goofy, hyperspeed tonguetwisters, he remains pleasant company: On \"El Gifto Magnifico\", he packs his syllables so tightly that the yammering verses spring out like paper snakes from a novelty peanuts can. Don't slow down to examine the lines, though, or you might notice that he is calling himself \"a black nerd thug showin' you the total strength of what a word does.\"Blackalicious were always nerdy, of course, but at least they used to be nerds trying out weird, audacious shit like the wild dragonsandswords fantasy of Nia's \"Cliff Hanger\" or the insane temposwitching lyrical workout \"Chemical Calisthenics\".Â Escape 2 Mars, sadly, doesn't contain any surprises. Instead, there's your sermonizing moneyisn'teverything cautionary tale (called, yup, \"Richman, Poorman\"); there's the savetheenvironment \"Electric Waterfalls\", which rails against \"technology and cell phones\" in an uncomfortably Matisyahulevel Jamaican patois. And, of course, there's the \"allrapsoundsthesamenow\" rant: \"Minime clone MCs talk, but they all are sayin'/ The exact same things, the exact same themes and hooks the exact same way,\" Gab gripes on \"Rhyme Travel\", a notuntrue observation that would nonetheless carry more bite if Gab himself had varied his subject matter even once in the past 10 years.There is another moment in \"Rhyme Travel\" where Gab talks about testing out new cadences \"let me see how it sounds when I rap this way!\" he cries and it's illuminating. As a rapper, Gab is pretty much all cadence, a flow tinkerer so caught up in devising new rhyme schemes that he forgets to listen to what he's actually saying. He gets in his own way time and again here; on \"Dreamin'\", he flounders over a stuttering, malfunctioningrobot delivery while both Del Tha Funkee Homosapien and Brother Ali lap him easily by trying half as hard. Worse, once you extricate his words from the horkheimered contraptions he has ensnared them in, you are usually left with lines limper than dayold pasta. Would that he actually pen the misbegotten freakazoid spacetravel opus I was fearing; at least that would have taken him someplace unexpected. As it stands, Gift of Gab don't seem likely to escape the gilded cage of the Okayplayer ghetto any time soon. "}
