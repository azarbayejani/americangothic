{"label":" Kindercore","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13068/homepage_large.f290b1eb.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Kasia Galazka","artist":"Ruby Isle","title":"Night Shot","text":" Ruby Isle banks on the same nostalgiabased fascination that keeps city thrift stores in business. Alongside guitarist Mark Mallman, bassist and vocoder handler Dan Geller pumps enough synth patches into their debut album to keep a solid power hour going. Their individual histories help explain their brand of relentless dancerock: Geller founded Kindercore and electropop duo I Am the World Trade Center, and Mallman once performed a 52.4 hourlong rock song aptly titled \"Marathon 2\" (the first \"Marathon\" lasted half the time) a few years ago.What Ruby Isle lack in lyrical dexterity (\"Hey hey hey, that kid's okay/ He's just another sucker with bills to pay\"), they make up for with presence. Hearing their electrofied cover of Peter Gabriel's \"Solsbury Hill\",Â which features Geller's IATWTC counterpart Amy Dykes, will probably make most who hear it bristle and think, \"Why?\" But, admittedly, if I was harboring a lucid buzz and heard those staccato synths, I would probably grab the nearest party peon's lapel and exclaim, \"Do you hear that?! That's Gabriel!\" All covers cause an initial familiarityeffect joy, which can either fade into disdain or boozefueled bopping. Ruby Isle will probably spur the latter not that they really give a shit. And that's why the best places to hear Night Shot are like those scenes in Can't Hardly Wait and every other teenseekingtail movie where kids are hanging off the stairs and puking into the pool.That's not to say Geller, Mallman, and drummer Aaron LeMay can't get you moving. They can, especially with pepsquad songs like \"Atom Bombs '09\". Even YouTube superstar Tay Zonday contributes guest vocals to the title track, sometimes sounding like his \"Chocolate Rain\" self, sometimes like the invisible \"Mortal Kombat\" referee indicating that you should probably start fighting. It's goofy party rock done more or less right, with programmed handclaps and unyielding (and borderline irksome) energy.The first pressing of Night Shot includes a bonus EP with songs from Ruby Isle's covers project. For a time, the band recorded a version of whatever song made the weekly top spot on music blog aggregator Elbo.ws; along the way, they managed to remove most of the whimsy and allure. Beach House's gorgeous \"Gila\" is wirestripped into a cheerleader anthem, and the sound effects that propelled M.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\" onto radio waves are replaced with vocal imitations. The only version of these that doesn't sting too much is \"Cherry Tulips\" by Headlights, which always needed a slight makeover. In the end, though Ruby Isle are hitandmiss with both their originals and their covers, there is a certain spunk here that's infectious; it's easy to admire their audacity, if not necessarily their sound.
