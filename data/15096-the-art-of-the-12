A collaboration between perfectionist superproducer Trevor Horn and theoretician/publicist/exjournalist Paul Morley, ZTT released many fewer songs than records: In the label's early period, every single from the likes of Propaganda, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and the Art of Noise arrived as a torrent of remixes, extensions, edits, and utter reworkings. ZTT was, at first, essentially an experimental labelwhich is an odd thing to say, given that it promptly scored a handful of massive hit singles in the U.K. But its central experiment (a successful one) was foregrounding the principles that the essence of a pop hit had at least as much to do with its presentation as with its composition or recording, and that a song and a recording and a mix were three entirely different things. The Art of the 12\" is a collection of various remixes from the ZTT archives, some from the label's glory years, others from a bit later on. (It's not quite a greatesthits Grace Jones's \"Slave to the Rhythm\" and the Art of Noise's \"Beat Box\" are conspicuous by their absence; it's also not a greatestmixes: The version of Frankie's \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" here is a rare one rather than a particularly good one.) \"Move with me inside the strange world of the 12inch,\" declares the BBCformal voiceover narrator who explains each element in the 12minute remix of Frankie's \"Rage Hard\". It wasn't an entirely original idea (King Curtis had gotten there a few decades earlier with \"Memphis Soul Stew\"), but it was a typically witty example of the way ZTT liked to put a frame around the mechanisms of pop and its marketing. When Horn and Morley and their associates actually applied their understanding of pop theory to artists and songs, though, extraordinary things happened. Propaganda's \"Duel (Jewelled)\" two wildly different interpretations of the same song, grafted together into a single mix is one of the most spectacular examples of their \"ABBA in hell\" aesthetic. (Propaganda singer Claudia Br√ºcken pops up a few other times here, notably on Act's \"Snobbery & Decay\", a song about decadence given one of the ZTT team's most decadently lush productions, and \"When Your Heart Runs Out of Time\", an unabashed power ballad recorded with Heaven 17's Glenn Gregory for the soundtrack of Nicolas Roeg's Insignificance.) The Art of Noise's slowly throbbing instrumental \"Moments in Love\" was famously played as Madonna and Sean Penn's wedding march. And Frankie's \"Relax\" went through endless permutations, including the \"Sex Mix Edit\" featured here, but its synthlubed bass whomp is the most rawly pornographic pop sound of the 80s. A few later tracks seem to be on The Art of the 12\" for rarity's sake: the Horn/Morley duo Art and Act's previously unreleased \"Life's a Barrel of Laughs\" is a failed experiment, and Nasty Rox Inc.'s \"10th Wonder\" is a gussiedup variation on the Sugarhill Gang's hiphop classic \"8th Wonder\", which didn't need any gussying. For that matter, (lomax)'s \"Waiting in Vain\" is as illconceived as you'd fear a Bob Marley cover by an act with eccentric orthography would be. Still, there are some great finds here too, especially a 9 1/2minute mix of Instinct's neverbeforeheard \"Sleepwalking\" they were a plastic funk trio who spun off from Pigbag, released one track on a ZTT sampler LP, and evaporated before this debut single could be released. It's also hard to imagine any other label at the time that would have (correctly) surmised that it would be a good idea to make a dance record that sounded like Michael Nyman (Andrew Poppy's \"32 Frames (Drummed Up)\"), or figured out that Anne Pigalle's cabaretchanteuse voice would sound better with electrofunk behind it. This isn't a definitive ZTT remix collection by a long shot, but if the label had a guiding philosophy, it was that there could never be such a thing as a \"definitive\" version. "}
