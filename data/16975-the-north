{"label":" ATO / Soft Revolution","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/18152/homepage_large.6baf9c8c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Stars","title":"The North","text":" Stars have always written about love, but they're equally fixated on time how it passes, how we wish we could slow it, how the past and present relate to each other, and how it marches on towards infinity. On \"Reunion\", a highlight from 2004's career high Set Yourself on Fire, Torquil Campbell's pitiful narrator looks back at his teenage years and pleads for the chance to return to those days to fix a broken relationship (but, primarily and somewhat selfishly, \"to be young and wild and free\"). \"Ageless Beauty\" from the same album attempts to bottle eternity as Amy Millan steadily consoles, \"Time will hold its promise/ We will always be a light.\" Words like \"today\" and \"tonight\" are thrown around liberally in the band's lyrics, but The North is steeped in nostalgia. This time, they seem to be looking back on the first half of their career, which found them upping the ante with every album (2001's electrocosmopolitan Nightsongs, 2003's sentimental Heart, the sweeping bombast of Set Yourself on Fire) before overstuffing themselves with haughty pretension (2007's In Our Bedroom After the War) and getting lost in their own halfformed ideas (2010's The Five Ghosts). The opener, \"Theory of Relativity\", announces itself with the same type of crackly, sampled audio that so memorably kicked off \"Your ExLover Is Dead\". The album's closer, \"Walls\", features a bit about how \"We were children/ We danced to 'Hand in Glove'\", a notsosubtle reminder that the band has ably covered not one, but two Smiths songs over the years. Stars apparently want to return to a headier, more naive time. But what's remarkable about The North is how unforced it sounds while conjuring the ghosts of past glories. It unspools pleasantly and unhurriedly, possessing the sort of sparkly glow that often comes with rejuvenation. One of the main problems with In Our Bedroom After the War was how hamhanded its conceptual narrative was (Torquil Campbell, after all, has had quite a bit of success as a stage actor too, and he will never, ever let you forget it). Despite Campbell's worrying claims that The North is a vaguely political album one only has to throw on \"He Lied About Death\" to remind oneself how irrefutably shitty he is at writing \"political\" songs there's really not a noticeable grand theme here. But then, Stars are a band that have been capable of solid songcraft even at their lowest moments. The album's sense of purpose means that there's plenty of room for the band to experiment, and the sonic playfulness on The North makes for an engrossing, repeatable listen. At first, the title track's shuffling duet is wellworn territory, right down to the lyrics about sleep being \"my friend/ And my rival\" and then, a bunch of soft, woozy synths slowly roll in, adding a slight layer of disorientation to the song's steady axis. \"Do You Want to Die Together?\"'s pushandpull 1950s rock motif is a textbook example of how tension should function in songwriting (not to mention the latest submission for what should be one hell of a Greatest Hits for these guys), while \"The 400\" takes Death Cab for Cutie's \"Transatlanticism\", shrinks it down, and fills the surrounding space with sparse guitar noise. As with The Five Ghosts, it's Millan who grabs the real highlights here, with the \"Ageless Beauty\"inreverse \"Backlines\" (which, at points, smacks of UK boy band One Direction's giddy headrush \"What Makes You Beautiful\") and the brittle, winding tartness of \"Progress\". The Five Ghosts was Stars' dullest and most unfocused work, an album so weak you had to wonder if Stars were done. But with The North, they've exceeded expectations. They may never achieve the youthful immortality they so often sing about, but it's nice to know that they're not dead just yet, either. "}
