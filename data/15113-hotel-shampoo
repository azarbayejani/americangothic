{"label":" Wichita / Turnstile","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/16208/homepage_large.2747c8d1.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nick Neyland","artist":"Gruff Rhys","title":"Hotel Shampoo","text":" If there were ever a map guiding Super Furry Animals mainman Gruff Rhys' musical path, he tossed it overboard long ago. He's set out on an endlessly convoluted route, using his instinct rather than reason to guide him. That rudderless approach has propelled a career full of neverending left turns, including recent collaborations with De La Soul and Gorillaz (on the latter's Plastic Beach), Sparklehorse and Danger Mouse (on Dark Night of the Soul) and Brazilian TV repairman Tony Da Gatorra (on The Terror of Cosmic Loneliness). Somehow, in the middle of all this activity, Rhys has found time to shoot a fulllength documentary (Separado!) and record this, his third solo album. It begins with \"Shark Ridden Waters\", one of the tracks Rhys recorded with Twisted Nerve/Finder Keepers cofounder Andy Votel, who lives up to his cratedigger reputation by shoveling in generous portions of the Cyrkle's cover of Bacharach and David's \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\". It plays out like a vintage, spythriller theme searching for a film, with Rhys intoning lines that belie a sinister undertow despite his wideeyed delivery. \"I don't know what's wrong with me,\" he croons, \"but lately I've been feeling like I'm truly... at the end.\" Such doommongering is at odds with the general thrust of Hotel Shampoo named after his OCDlike habit of collecting shampoo bottles from hotel rooms which opens byways back to the songcraft Rhys expertly mastered with his main band. In fact, much of this album allows Rhys to extract ideas he's worked on in the past and breathe some new life into them. As such, it's hard not to play connectthedots. \"Take a Sentence\" is a warmhearted ballad flushed with gently parping trumpets that mirror \"Presidential Suite\" from Rings Around the World; \"Patterns of Power\" offers a measured take on the condensed guitar brawling of \"Out of Control\" from Phantom Power; and \"Sensations in the Dark\" spins around the same frenetic Tropicália/mariachi mashup as \"Northern Lites\" from Guerilla. Like most of Rhys' projects, there's no particular destination in mind here, no groove that he hits on and settles into. The only thing that binds Hotel Shampoo together are his agreeable vocal tones, which have a soft familiarity to them, whether he's tackling the environment on \"Conservation Conversation\" or encroaching on folky love song territory with \"If We Were Words (We Would Rhyme)\". The tangible difference between this and Rhys' other band is the absence of any tightly wound electronics from keyboardist Cian Ciárán, although some similar instrumentation lends an endearing sloppiness to the proceedings. The rudimentary analog keyboard loosely splodged over \"Honey All Over\" only adds to its understated grace. The album peaks twothirds of the way in over consecutive tracks: \"Christopher Columbus\", which equates a spurned lover's actions with the spread of western imperialism, all set to gravelly beats and a plasticsoul sax solo that recalls Deerhunter's \"Coronado\"; and \"Space Dust #2\", a jazzy duet with El Perro Del Mar that's pierced with Sirkian melodrama and a playfulness reminiscent of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood's duets. \"You couldn't even look me in the eye,\" she accuses. \"You had your sunglasses on,\" is his pithy response. Impressively, Hotel Shampoo manages to strike the right balance between Rhys' desire to indulge odd whims, lyrical humor, outright pop, and heartfelt sentiment. More importantly, he always makes it sound effortless. There's no forced quirkiness shoehorned in, no conceits taken so far that they topple over into selfindulgence. He's excellent at reviewing and editing his own work, making sure all the small parts serve the whole but never overwhelm it. You can hear it in the outoftune piano runs sprinkled over a passage of \"Conservation Conversation\", or in the way \"Sophie Softly\" refracts into delightfully spindly synth tones at its close. If Rhys is set to return to Super Furry Animals any time soon, this album suggests that he's in rude health, both lyrically and musically, and that they may regain some ground lost through the uneven Dark Days/Light Years. But the man is an unreliable narrator at the helm of his own career, putting up smoke and mirrors at every turn, waiting to plunge us to unfamiliar depths at any moment. "}
