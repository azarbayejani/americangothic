Look, the Pipettes and El Perro del Mar dressed the ShangriLas or Ronettes in new, indiepop knickers. The Long Blondes added Britpop spleen and 1970s UK punk charge. Named after both Last Exit to Brooklyn's gangrape victim and the, uh, singsongy nonsense phrase, Tralala layer energetic, roughshod vocal harmonies over sugary Ramones punk. Strawberries on Frosted Flakes, right? A lot of the time, sure. Tralala's sound is a more finely distilled sonic reference than those of their peers, and on sophomore album Is That the Tralala the group's sharply focused youngloveinNYC pop songs hint toward an extroverted, femalefronted Exploding Hearts. Opener \"We're Coming Out\" is a punkisfun prelude to a girl's night out, while \"Are You Gonna Dance (With Me)\" briskly chastises a wallflower date (\"Did you just come to stare?\") and \"Early Tonight\" sneaks out for boyfriendless good times. You're more likely to find songs about drunken cab rides (\"Yellow Taxi\") or not wanting to eat for fear of ruining a buzz (\"BLT\") than one of the Hearts' lovesick calls, but some of the same energy is present. Also present: a song about those dead West Virginia coal miners (\"Tallmansville, W. Va.\"). Ripped from your last year's headlines, that song's a bit more serious than even terse psychodramas like \"No Pain No Pain\", from Tralala's 2005 selftitled debut. Little else changes on Is That the Tralala, least of all, thankfully, the group's gritty production. An exception: Extended headlight metaphor \"One Hard Turn Deserves Another\" and extended James Bondstyle shoeheel armament metaphor \"Secret Weapon\" give guitarist Chris Talsness a chance to break out of his default fuzztone downstrums for some Televisionesque solo heroics. Someone obviously isn't drinking enough.  Whatever, two albums in, it's pretty clear Tralala aren't entirely a puton ties to band managers and influential New York record store Other Music be damned. It's tough not to make believe there's something going on here besides girls with amateurish voices having fun with their friends, singing 'bout boys 'n' booze. Like: \"You think I'm retrospective of someone you used to know,\" goes the Wipers cover \"Mystery\", so it might almost be some elaborate metatease... or another postriotgrrrl song about boys. Anyway, these dudes (genderneutral, dammit!) may have great bangs, decent chops, and stupidsmart rock 'n' roll panache, but I still wish my favorite song by them wasn't off their 2005 Christmas EP.
