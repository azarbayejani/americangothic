{"label":" Grimsey","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/3297/homepage_large.621c9e70.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Marc Hogan","artist":"Fan Modine","title":"Homeland","text":" Wouldbe connoisseurs are sometimes too quick to dismiss certain wispy indie pop by using Mike Myers' everpotent barb: \"If it's not Scottish, it's crap!\" Despite the obvious nods to The Pastels or Belle & Sebastian, that's never been true even if you don't have enough patience for Australia's The Lucksmiths. For one thing, forebears like Felt and The Field Mice hailed from England, not Scotland. For another, albums like Fan Modine's Homeland provide a sparkling reminder of the winsome pop gems in American listeners' backyards. On this sophomore effort, Fan Modine mastermind Gordon Zacharias draws from the elegance of early Magnetic Fields and the groovebased intimacy of The Folk Implosion more than, say, Beat Happening, the original exception to the Scotophiliac rule. But where 69 Love Songs often focused on love's ironies (\"Love Is Like a Bottle of Gin\"), Homeland is an unabashed paean to its peaks. While One Part Lullaby explored Lou Barlow's alienation after moving across the country (\"E.Z.L.A.\"), Fan Modine's latest, as its title implies, is about that elusive, invaluable feeling of \"home.\" The album's centerpiece is \"Pageantry\", which pits a hushed, theatrical vocal against burbling Her Space Holidayesque orchestration. \"Pageantry walks through the door,\" Zacharias exults at his most Stephin Merrittlike, \"and I keep repeating track number four.\" Originally released as a seveninch in 1999, \"Pageantry\" has been a long time coming to CD although it didn't really need to be slotted at track four, did it? Save that for the many hopeful mixtapes this song is sure to grace. The previous song, \"We Are All Decades\", is the one most explicitly influenced by Lou Barlow's extraSebadoh noodlings. The prominent bass line and Barlowesque, doubletracked vocal wouldn't have been out of place alongside Folk Implosion breakthrough \"Natural One\" on the Kids soundtrack, though some subtle vocoder adds a new twist. The lyrics might fit an elliptical collaboration between Sentridoh and Cole Porter: \"The more you placate everybody/ The less you can escape the world/ Act tall to the street vendor.\"Homeland is arguably less ambitious than Fan Modine's debut, the selfreleased 1998 concept album Slow Road to Tiny Empire. But improved confidence and recording quality shore up a batch of songs that find beauty in the familiar as much as the abstract. Zacharias lent his elegant voice to this year's charming debut by orchestral pop duo Hercules, who return the favor with string arrangements and coproduction duties on four songs here. Wordier than Zacharias' Hercules outings, these tunes expand on the violinsoaked palette of \"Pageantry\", awash in pleasant decadence. Opening with modest acoustic guitar strums, first track \"Newsstand of the Sun\" blossoms into a Manciniesque discovery of romance. If not for further Merrittesque lyrics about dandies, Bentleys and lion cages, \"Waiting in the Wings\" could fit on Hercules' In the Alleyway here, the song plays like an adaptation of the Henry James story The Beast in the Jungle, with worldly riches rather than overweening egoism preventing this John Marcher from finding \"one true love.\" Though Homeland's theme emerges early on, a Hercules collaboration cements it. Amid the bouncy tin pan alley of \"Throughout Your Life\", Zacharias masterfully toes the line between fine gruyere and common EZ Cheez. \"There's nothing quite like knowing where you belong,\" he sings, asking a lover to marry him with heartbreaking earnestness you won't find on the new Jimmy Eat World album. For now, Zacharias apparently belongs in Carrboro, N.C., where he has put together a new quintet incarnation of Fan Modine including former members of Jets to Brazil, Polvo, and Idyll Swords. Good pop belongs wherever you hear it thanks, Scotland, but occasionally we Yanks get it right. "}
