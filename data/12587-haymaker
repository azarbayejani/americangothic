Deusner","artist":"The Gourds","title":"Haymaker!","text":" The exclamation point in the title of the Gourds' latest album doesn't lie: The Austinbased band plays an emphatic, exclamatory amalgam of Americana styles, ambling through prerock country, bluegrass, rockabilly, and Western swing. The Lone Star angle is essential in differentiating the band from the crowd of Appalachiadescended string bands who have sprung up in the Gourds' wake; the Hackensaw Boys, the Avett Brothers, and Chatham County Line play many of the same instruments, but toward regionally and musically different ends. The Gourds draw from the same well as Doug Sahm, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Bush, which makes them part barband rockers and part ensemble pickers. In their live shows, they dig their spurs into a song and open up its possibilities, whether it's a spirited original or an unlikely cover. Their stage presence is the key to their longevity, but their studio albums have become increasingly adventurous, with 2007's Noble Creatures and now Haymaker! gradually closing the gap between their recorded material and their performances. The nonpunctuation part of that album title refers to a knockout punch that floors your opponent. That might be overselling the album, but a dependable swing isn't far off. Haymaker! is a typically witty, rambunctious album that shuffles up the band members like a deck of cards. Three of the five Gourds sing lead, which gives each song a distinct personality without making it sound like a different band. Kevin \"Shinyribs\" Russell, besides having a great nickname, has perhaps the most recognizable voice here, lending a downhome quality to \"Country Love\" and \"The Way You Can Get\". Jimmy Smith sounds like Springsteen sitting in with the Sir Douglas Quintet on \"New Dues\" and \"Thurman\", although he can't redeem the awkward hook of \"Luddite Juice\". That leaves Max Johnston singing the modestly mournful \"Valentine\" and the closer \"Tighter\" and sounding about 20 or 30 years older than he actually is. If Noble Creatures made the Gourds sound like yokel Burroughses, writing lyrics so nonlinear they sounded like cutups, Haymaker! creates a more lucid slang that emphasizes backporch wordplay on the otherwise pedestrian rocker \"Country Gal\" and nearly anthropological details on the trucker anthem \"Shreveport\".\"Wake up! We're going to the country,\" Shinyribs sings on the energetic opener \"Country Love\", which ushers you into the Gourds' rural realm, where watching the stars together counts as a date and where a hook in the chorus is just as good as a hook in a fish. In fact, Haymaker! has a travelogue feel, which is perhaps inevitable for a hardtouring band. These songs traipse across northern Louisiana (\"Shreveport\") to the Texas plains (\"All the Way to Jericho\", namesake of the notoriously muddy Jericho Gap on Route 66) and points west (\"TexMex Mile\"). They stop to pick up an idealistic hitchhiker in a tight Che tshirt on the standout \"Bridgett\", on which Smith balances grinning wit and searing regret over Claude Bernard's rangey accordion. \"I bid adios to my camouflage rider,\" he sings wistfully. \"She said, 'Thanks for the lift, you old geezer.'\" That punchilne has some real sting to it, more potent for being so unexpected and more barbed for bursting his expectations. The Gourds' trip just gets longer and stranger. "}
