{"label":" Firm","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13449/homepage_large.7b4e2f16.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Nitsuh Abebe","artist":"Geiger","title":"Out of Tune","text":" It's not what you'd expect not from a star remixer for the Kompakt label, not from a close associate of Schaeben and Voss, and maybe not even from the man behind the terrific \"CocainE\" 12inch. That track, after all, was tight: Chunkyfunky drums, hot'n'slippery discoid bass, and one long lascivious whisper of a vocal. The spangly acoustic guitar and unselfconscious cheeseout solo might have made it sound like Phoenix except Phoenix are always asking you to get on the dance floor and smile and be happy, whereas Geiger seemed to be asking you to come join him in the men's room for a couple minutes. He sounds like he's asking the same question on this album, sure. But strings of mediocre tracks and wild stylistic shifts two things that just don't sit well together make you want to tell him you'll meet him in there in five minutes, and then run out to look for a cab. For one thing, the guy's got a terrible opening line, something only notches above carrying a comedy \"Booty Inspector\" badge. \"Hot Body\" is fiveplus minutes of nicely formed but entirely unremarkable house tick, background music for a weirdly boring lounge, layered with an interview from some webporn woman; it's almost as if he realized the first four minutes weren't very interesting, and fired up his web browser to find some bit of audio that might distract you. So you try to brush him off, but he comes back with stronger material: \"Bless the Lord\" has some wonderfully sweaty slow burn, and it showcases Geiger's stonedseducer voice better than anything else on here. After that one, you might even be willing to tell him your real name only then he gets cocky and offers you an \"Interlude\". And here you were, hoping \"Hot Body\" was meant to be the throwaway intro. Here you were, too, thinking Geiger might play to his slickfunk strengths. \"Sunday\" revs them up into a decent rocker, running from disco verse to fuzzedout chorus like a kitschless version of Electric Six's \"Danger! High Voltage\" (okay, my name's Nitsuh, you're Geiger? Alex Geiger?) but then suddenly \"Love Song\" is some horribly dippy acoustic folk, with a complete mess of a pseudopsychedelic interlude. Who is this guy, anyway? Oh, you'll never know; the swift recovery on \"CocainE\" isn't going to carry you through. There's something nice in the way \"Five Years\" moves from the old sweaty groove to interludes that are basically indierock drama, and \"Studio Star\" is halfgood at spreading CheezWhizz funk over itself, Alan Braxestyle. But there's just nothing here that's got much of a shot at grabbing you just ongoing slowhouse strut and lascivious vocal and the strange sense that you're listening to the collected outtakes and demos from some muchbetter record. Plus another painful folk number. About animals. Something to sing when, 30 minutes later, he comes out of the restroom looking for you and finds that you're long gone.  "}
