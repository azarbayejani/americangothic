Grumpy people call it the worst sort of recycling (last night's Cheez Whiz, microwaved), as if dance music hasn't been pulling gems from that mine since forever. But the track works, stomping beautifully through the commercial universe: Fridaynight megamixes on the top40 station, stereo demo discs at Best Buy, endofnight hugs between the older guys at the lesscool gay bar. A few months later: We get mix after mix of other people's hiNRG takes on squishy 80s ballads, right down to Cutting Crew. Moral of story: Drunk people like to do a lot of things, but \"dance\" and \"emote along with familiar songs\" are both near the top of the list. Stuff like this takes shortcuts to both, and grumps who imagine the phenomenon is limited to shopping malls have another think coming. Diplo and Hollertronix have been known to do indie versions of the same thing, bulking up the beats behind hip staples from Siouxsie and the Banshees, Talking Heads, the Cure, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Rock bands release fulllength remix albums. Interpol hook up with Arthur Baker. People have been pointing this out since 2001: Folks nowadays want to dance and listen to indie at the same time, and lowbudget mashups and endless spins of \"Blue Monday\" don't seem to be cutting it. Yeah, well: Whether it's DJ Sammy action or dancingtoindie, there are better ways to fill the gap than Future Retro, a discful of middling remixes of hipfriendly 80sish tracks from the WEA back catalog many of which were not exactly in need of reconfiguring. To their credit, these revamps are largely pretty competent, and they're mostly \"deep\" mixes, putting together allnew, allfunctional, allmodern backings for the familiar vocals to migrate to. Some people will have professional reasons for needing that kind of translation say, commercial DJs who for some reason want a version of Erasure's \"A Little Respect\" they can work into electronic house sets. Some of them are even decent on their own. Elite Force's chunkyfunk take on \"White Lines\" is a solid track without too much connection to the original. The Crystal Method take \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" and Richard X takes Yaz's \"Situation\"; both know well enough to add a little energy and then leave things alone. But for you, the enduser listener: Exactly what was missing from dancing to Erasure in the first place? (Or \"Situation\", or the Cure's \"The Walk\", or \"Bizarre Love Triangle?\") The limited usefulness only points to the problem with the allfunction translations here: Hardly any of them do much to bring anything new to the material, anything beyond dressing them up for an eversoslightly different social occasion. Some of them can't even manage that very well: Jaded Alliance make a harmonic mess of \"A Little Respect\", Alphaville's \"Forever Young\" gets a cheeseball post\"Heaven\" treatment, and the mix of INXS's \"Need You Tonight\" on here bugs me on levels I'm not even prepared to plumb. The treats at the end a big motorik drone over BMovie's \"Nowhere Girl\", and churchorgan cutup fun with Morrissey's \"Suedehead\" are way too little, way too late, and may even only sound good by comparison. And all this now, with so much good new dance music in the world? Trust me: It's the last thing you need. "}
