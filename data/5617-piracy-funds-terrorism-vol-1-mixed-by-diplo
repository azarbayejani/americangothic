Why bother with presents? 2005's Tickle Me Elmo was supposed to be a chickenlegged Sri Lankan with so much sex in her selfspun neons you might as well get wasted off penicillin with Willie Nelson at a secret Rex the Dog show. But guess what? On Halloween she showed up in Philadelphia for her Fader gig, sat herself under a big fucking Christmas tree, and dished out free copies of Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1, the mixtape masterpiece she and Diplo Hollertronix had spent the 10 previous days putting together in his apartment. Batteries included!So a large portion of her forthcoming debut, Arular, has willfully gone leaky boat here. Many of her tracks sound similar to one another: A 505 Groovebox queefs out splatty, farty beats and M.I.A. shouts lyrics of varying snark over them, sometimes even singing them. (Sometimes.) She's been irresistible in single land, but M.I.A.'s fulllength runs the risk of seeming limited and discrediting her misleading but awesome \"female Dizzee Rascal\" tag, replacing that description with \"Neneh Cherry, Mk. II\" a label that has likely dawned on anyone who has seen the \"Buffalo Stance\"like \"Galang\" video.That is why this mixtape kills: The format fits M.I.A. perfectly. Her songs benefit greatly from Diplo's recent baile funk fetish (confer his recent Favela On Blast tape), some choice dub and American hiphop cuts to break up the blaze to blaze and razorblades, and some flatout brilliant mashups.On the upstroke, \"Galang\" goes reggaeton; on the down, Diplo cops the song a Lil Vicious beat and a lil keyboard hook, and it's so whoa you'll have to punch yourself in the face to stop smiling. \"Fire Fire\" goes bam bam then walks like an Egyptian in a telling Bangles mashup the two songs play so nicely together they could be siamese, until Diplo misdemeans \"Pass That Dutch\" with M.I.A.'s snakey music box schwarma. M.I.A.'s \"Amazon\" coupled with Ciara's radiofriendly microcrunk squelch is an early highlight, though that squirmy synth on Clipse's \"Definition of a Roller\" makes for good freak, too, packing just enough snaggletooth funk to forgive those recent Neptunes missteps.For a tape whose initial appeal was the instant and gratifying relief it brought to everyone waiting for M.I.A.'s fulllength, Diplo ironically saves M.I.A.'s best cuts for last. \"URAQT\" is a jittery mess of flirting, territorymarking, and textmessaging (!): \"You fuckin with my man and you text him all the time/ You mighta had him once but I have him all the time,\" and later, \"URAQT/ Is your daddy dealer, cause you're dope to me!\" For dessert, Diplo brings \"Big Pimpin'\" out of retirement to back M.I.A.'s raspy \"Bingo\": \"Do you know what is on? Do you know what is on? Do you know how this beat is made in fucking Londddon?\" The song's obviously great, but between M.I.A.'s fierce deliveries and the braggart beat, it sounds weird and ominous, a blackhole closer to an album brimming with life.Last week, Sasha FrereJones profiled M.I.A. in The New Yorker, spraypainting her as a consummate and naturally \"world\" artist. M.I.A. is silly, dancey, cheap, expensive, truthful, and utterly serious all at once just like the world (!). She's not exactly ragstoriches (yet), but her pop carries unwittingly significant weight, and to potentially far more people than just a few hundred ecstatic MP3 blog readers. It's one thing for M.I.A. to be a \"world\" pop star; it will be another thing for her to release an album that reflects that backstory. For now, Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1 takes that burden off of Arular: Diplo has actualized our hopes for M.I.A. qua world pop star, and we didn't even have to leave him cookies. "}
