No one is quite sure what they're doing there, except that they had nothing better to do on a Friday night than attend some $8 showcase for \"up and coming\" area bands. Naturally, everyone is skeptical and drunk but for the ringmaster er, emcee. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he bellows out, extending his right arm, \"hailing from ChampaignUrbana... the indiepop Mecca that brought you Braid, Wolfie, Hum, and of course, REO Speedwagon... let me introduce the hottest new band to follow in these footsteps... everybody please welcome... Everybody Uh Oh!\" Everybody in the crowd says, \"Uhoh.\" They are being funny, of course, and they laugh at their collective joke. A bold, scrappy teenager yells \"uhoh\" again, but no one laughs, and someone tells him that \"that joke has already been done, dude,\" which, in turn, prompts a few scattered laughs. \"No, no, no.\" The emcee is already frustrated with these kids, these goddamn kids who wouldn't know talent if it unzipped their pants and gave them the best fucking blowjob of their lives. \"That's the name of the band,\" he says. Everybody moans, \"Ohhhh,\" drawing it out as only disaffected teens can, or will. Then, right on cue, four guys lumber out. No one in the crowd claps or yells out. They are judging, lest they be judged. The band's debut, Man Am I Brad, is supposed to be some cross between Neutral Milk Hotel, Smashing Pumpkins, and Yo La Tengo. But as head songwriter Jeremy Keller eases into the slowcore of \"Eunice\", an observer finely points out that, instead, the band sounds \"like a cross between piss and shit.\" Perhaps Keller thinks he can connect with his audience with such lines as, \"All the kids are out tonight,\" but he is wrong. As the song drags on past the sixminute mark, the hope heard in the lyrics is drowned out by the kids, who are out tonight, and for whom all hope of a good time is passing. \"Serious Mode\" is the band's attempt to liven things up. There's a peppy drumbeat and even a tambourine. Then the lead singer has to open his mouth again: \"I feel so tired 'cause I'm not awake/ You feel you need more.\" Then it's all about not stopping: \"It's up to you.\" And he sings this over and over until people are blatantly wincing. Everybody UhOh then breaks out its drum machine, first for a inoffensive stab at a Death Cab for Cutie jingle, then for a terrible tune that shifts from Magnetic Fields simplicity to like a Humlike thrasher in which Keller asks, \"How will they know that I'm rock 'n' roll?\" Some guy in the back quips, \"We'll be sure to let them know!\" Beer cans are being hurled by the time the band plays \"Keeping Up with the Joneses\", in which the group approximates \"Cherub Rock\"era Smashing Pumpkins, except with even worse lyrics. \"The Trees of Prentiss\" is a better Death Cab try and wouldn't have pissed anyone off if not for lines like, \"Paul says that I waste my time and kids bobbing heads is a victimless crime.\" The kids don't even stick around for the remaining songs, let alone the next band. They have heard enough amateurish, repetitive songwriting for the night and they've got better things to do like stand in parking lots and take the long way home. Most leave without a word, but the scrappy kid, seeking redemption, yells out, \"The next REO Speedwagon, my ass!\" Everyone laughs, and he is perhaps the only one who goes home happy. "}
