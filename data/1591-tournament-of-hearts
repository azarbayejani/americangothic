Ontario's Constantines, too, counterbalance their work their allusiveness and unblunted riffs with a roughhewn populism. Their songs might conjure the ghosts of Italian futurists, obscure 50s casualties, or Rod Stewart, but they ultimately bleed with love, rock 'n' roll, and the boozestained nights that follow workaday days. The band's selftitled debut clamored for the death of rock music, while 2003's equally impressive Shine a Light saw a great band building its dank, proletarian vision, dancing through alleyways, too drunk to steer or to stop. Third album Tournament of Hearts stumbles to its factory job the next morning, shakes out the cobwebs, and turns the radio dial to classic rock. It's gentler than its predecessors, relying on sweat and unresolved tension rather than a glorious gutterpoet deluge, though the change is more of subtleties than of substance. Here, the band consecrates not the grand passions of Shine a Light but the everyday labors of nurses, phone operators, and working stiffs \"from Herald Square to the heavens, earth, and sea.\" In depicting ordinary people, the Constantines unabashedly evoke bands that ordinary people might like. \"Working Fulltime\", inspired by the work of 93yearold Chicago journalist and oral historian Studs Terkel, nods toward BachmanTurner Overdrive in its title and simple, powerchord refrain, then dives into a G'n'R twinguitar breakdown. \"We will not be undersold,\" singer/guitarists Bry Webb and Steve Lambke grimly chant, after insisting, \"We wake up every morning full of wonder.\" The album's most immediate track, \"Soon Enough\", is nearly as direct and overpowering as Shine a Light's immortal \"On to You\", but with a soft, countrified strum rather than its predecessor's punkderived tumult. \"Work and love will make a man out of you,\" Webb repeats, his stillthroaty vocals sounding as subdued as the arrangement. It's not that Tournament of Hearts doesn't rock, but it's more constrained, finding power in withheld but everimminent explosions. Opener \"Draw Us Lines\" drones over a single guitar chord, namedropping San Francisco ecowitch Starhawk over pounding drums out of a pagan ritual. \"Hotline Operator\" not to be confused with the Nighttime/Anytime EP's samenamed instrumental builds pressure with whispery choruses before a final, alltoobrief doubletime coda and anguished wail. A few of the tracks draw on the sludgerock side of former tourmates Oneida, such as the greasy guitar of \"Lizaveta\", which also revisits \"Insectivora\" horns. Elsewhere, the looser \"Good Nurse\" puts the band's recent stint as Neil Young cover band Horsey Craze to good use. But the most unrestrained track is standout \"Love in Fear\", with its elliptical bass and guitars whining like sirens, as Webb implores, \"Just kiss me on a rooftop.../ Under helicopters of desire.\" Lambke, who provided lead vocals on Shine a Light's jagged \"Scoundrel Babes\", takes the forefront twice on Tournament. His thin, unprojected voice is in stark contrast with Webb's Greg Dullilike gruffness, though the lyrics about abattoirs and life in the city on the cool, hornladen \"Thieves\" could just as easily come out of Webb's mouth. Acoustic closer \"Windy Road\" is a brave misstep, shooting for Iron & Wine but ending up someplace whinier, despite the Constantines' usual lyrical prowess: \"Best get new dreams/ These old dreams won't last,\" Lambke murmurs. The metaphorical battleofsexes resonance of Tournament of Hearts is obvious, but curling is also a deeply Canadian sport. Webb sings of \"pissing rain\" and \"the weird winds of Ontario\" as his songs detail Canadian bluecollar paychecktopaycheck. Amid the glacial guitar strums and funereal percussion of \"You Are a Conductor\", the penultimate track, he bestows upon his subjects what working life sometimes takes away: control, or, more specifically, the ability to direct one's own path, like a curler's broom hurrying hard to make way for the rock (the rock!). \"Shamble on,\" Webb moans, more softly than ever.
