{"label":" Caroline / Echo / She Bear","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/9678/homepage_large.62db3e56.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Matt LeMay","artist":"Bat For Lashes","title":"Fur & Gold","text":"  Think \"bat\" as in both the flirty verb and the gothy noun. Fur & Gold is often a dark and atmospheric record, but it remains playful and selfaware enough to pull back every time it inches towards selfparody. Largely structured around the vocals of the Pakistaniborn Brit Natasha Khan, Fur & Gold shows a band quite good at giving their songs room to breathe and evolve, allowing the songs to expand out before snapping back into focus on Khan's expressive voice. Opener \"Horse and I\" skirts Renaissance Faire silliness, but proves musically intriguing enough to push past any hokey aesthetic choices. Yes, Khan can come off as a bit dramatic, but her best songs fit the part. \"Trophy\" is perhaps the album's finest track, plodding along elegantly like a darker and slicker Lavender Diamond. \"Tahiti\" is the sonic standout, but suffers from some jarringly awkward phrasing in its chorus. \"Sad Eyes\" never quite fulfills the emotional potential generated by Khan's voice and some sparse piano chords, and it also illustrates a wider point: Uncomplicated and vaguely mystical lyrics generally make sense here, but Khan occasionally sings like she's not really sure what she's saying. An unexpected \"Come and spend the night\" halfway through \"Sad Eyes\" might as well be \"I'd like a burrito.\" Many of the album's biggest disappointments come simply because the band's potential is so palpable, especially during more restrained and focused moments. But as strong as Fur & Gold's individual tracks can be, the record as a whole is frustratingly dilute. While Khan has a real talent for edging towards emotional extremes, she seems to get lost in atmosphere. And ultimately, Fur & Gold sounds a little bit too comfortable for its own good. Khan is a great singer, and her band is undoubtedly competent and capable, but the record sounds like it wants to be more than it is. Khan stops just short of the boldness that can make this kind of record great imagine Bj√∂rk wearing a fur coat rather than a dead swan or Siouxsie Sioux wearing a peasant dress rather than a Nazi uniform. Bat For Lashes dip their feet in some difficult waters, but often seem too preoccupied with their reflection to jump in.  "}
