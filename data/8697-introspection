As record shop owners (someday I'll make a pilgrimage to Dearborn, Michigan's Stormy Records) and diehard fans of independent music, it's no surprise to find Windy & Carl drawn to lovingly packaged limited editions; the duo have never shied from sending a lone piece of music to a friendly if isolated home on a fellow fanatic's compilation. With their steady production rate over the last ten years, they've amassed a significant catalog of oddsandends, many of which are collected for this threedisc set. The first disc is subtitled \"Singles and EPs\". Now, I have the split seveninch they did with the Silver Apples, but the idea of Windy & Carl putting out singles has always struck me as a little odd; my favorite album of theirs is still the deep, dense Antarctica, which has only three tracks and runs 40 minutes. Windy & Carl's drones take a while to get going; you need to spend enough time inside their sound to become immersed, and for a moment forget any other sounds ever existed. Accordingly, the singles material on the first disc, which also happens to be of an earlier vintage, is to my ears the weakest of the three. Windy & Carl deserve the best possible fidelity, and the older, homerecorded material is understandably a bit crude. Occasionally these limitations are an advantage, as on the odd \"Christmas Song\" (not the Mel Torme number), where gurgling feedback takes on an even warmer cast with lofi distortion, but in other places, the sound gets a big murky, and vague. The best part about disc one is its variety: perhaps in an effort to honor the tradition of the format, the singles tend to have more songoriented structures, with lots of strummed guitars, and not so much in the way of drone. \"Watersong\" and \"Dragonfly\" released as the duo's first seveninch in 1993 are two dark tracks with vocals possessed of a little Galaxie 500 innocence, sounding almost like Movietone. Despite the voice being so up front, both are a bit light on melody. Things pick up considerably on disc two, subtitled \"Compilations\". Most of these songs date from 1996 and 1997, when Windy & Carl hit their stride, and developed an understanding of their strengths. The processed feedback in \"Beyond Asleep\", which begins the second disc, suggest that Windy & Carl learned great lessons from Fripp & Eno, and transformed that knowledge to create something even more placid and inviting. The lovely \"Marble Dream\" shows how adept they became at inserting vocal tracks since their awkward beginnings; Windy's singing is miles better than that first single, and they've found the right technique for mixing it with Carl's shimmering drones. Two live tracks \"Live at Go Sound\" and \"Live Song from Transmissions\" offer an interesting portrait of the noisier, more unsettling corner of Windy & Carl's world. Disc three (\"Live + Unreleased\") is just as good; though one would imagine their layered, careful music to be a studio proposition, Windy & Carl pull it off quite well live, managing to fill all that space with just a couple of guitars and effects pedals. Disc three also has live versions of tracks from Depths back to back (\"Undercurrent\" and \"Set Adrift\"), which made me remember what a great record that is. The simplicity of \"Set Adrift\" in particular is stunning: hearing it performed in the studio at WDET, I notice for the first time that it's little more than a duet between an acoustic and electric guitar, but such complex feelings are contained in its simply plucked, twochord riff. As a compilation, Introspection is naturally Windy & Carl's most varied release, in terms of both style and quality. Listening to it, I realized I still think of these two as an album band particularly as they've taken a turn toward thematically uniform material like Depths and Consciousness but Introspection recollects key chapters of the band's very compelling story, and at just $20 for three discs and detailed, trackbytrack liner notes, you can't miss.
