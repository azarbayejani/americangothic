{"label":" Def Jam","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16040/homepage_large.a12aa6de.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"Sheek Louch","title":"Donnie G: Don Gorilla","text":" Over the past decadeplus, Sheek Louch has had the ignominious distinction of being an obvious third wheel: he's the only member of veteran Yonkers trio the LOX never to rap in a shoe commercial, Jadakiss and Styles P do their awesome backandforth thing only with each other, and while those two have managed hits independently, the only things you really knew about Sheek as a solo artist was that Ghostface seemed to like him, and he may have released an album on Koch. And yet, now that the album in question, Donnie G, finally arrives it's as his debut on the iconic Def Jam label. Donnie G is a testament to Sheek's resiliency, but over those hardfought years the rapper hasn't reinvented himself so much as recontextualized his emphatic starvingartist bark integrating the requisite hashtag and adlibs of 2010 with fewer seams than you'd expect. It's allowed him to subsequently sound about right in the galaxy of Kay Slay rap: Evergrinding NYC mixtape types like Maino, Uncle Murda, and Papoose, dudes whose beefs you can never keep straight, always seem on the verge of a majorlabel release that never happens, and are long on regional bluster and even longer on facepalm punchlines. Sheek honors the PEsampling intro \"Rhyme Animal\" by calling himself \"rap's herpes\" with no irony whatsoever (whether \"you don't want to see me\" is a justifiable explanation is up for debate) and then obviously rhyming that with Slurpees and Hercules. Later on, he claims to \"lyrically ejaculate,\" but that's not quite as embarrassing as saying, \"Don Don about to blow up grenade!\" And y'all thought he was going to say \"World Trade.\" Unlike Jada, Sheek doesn't bog down Donnie G with illfated pop moves, and there isn't the unrelenting grimness of Styles' solo work. As the very rare rapper who brags about how good is he at lifting weights as moving it, Donnie G is at its best when \"bottle service\" means Vitamin Water instead of Nuvo. Statik Selektah's beat on \"Nite Falls\" somehow has scifi proggers Planet P Project soundtracking a club riot, and while \"Clip Up (Reloaded)\" and the Black Uhurusampling \"Dinner Guest\" aspires to be something of lowbudget \"POWER\", it's a reminder of the LOX's potency when they attack a track as a posse cut rather than a concession to Hot 97. Obviously, the attempt at Drakelike poprap with DJ Webstar (you know, the \"Chicken Noodle Soup\" dude) doesn't sound like it has much investment from anyone involved; a smooth Jeremih hook makes \"Party After 2\" Sheek's best seduction of both females and radio play. On \"Dinner Guest\", you finally get some insight into the life of someone who often goes out of his way to portray himself simply as a blank Consummate Thug: While looking back on his decade and a half career, he raps, \"Did deals with everybody, even survived the Puff rape,\" and yet earlier, he boasts that he's \"trying to be like Diddy, put some women in the tub (take that!).\" This isn't new: there've been plenty of references to getting his \"Benjamins\" money back throughout the past few years, but what's weirder is that he's slyly complementary of Diddy as well Donnie G is damn near a longform commercial for Ciroc, and the LOX even reconsidered signing with the guy again. That really goes to the heart of the howeverlimited appeal of Donnie G: For years, the LOX have been seen as emblematic industry victims, but at his best, Sheek eschews that and realizes the paradoxical ability to sound like a beast and an underdog at the same time.
