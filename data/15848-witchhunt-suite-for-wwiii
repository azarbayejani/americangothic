His smarmy 1970s hooks, newwave crooning, and AMradio aura aren't so much recycled as regurgitated, the sound of internalized pop culture projected back out, with many original qualities still intact. As his discography has grown, though, his songs have seemed less about other people's work than his own. His first big studio album, 2010's Before Today, had its share of retro references but was most interesting for how it furthered his own history. Pink's older days have returned via a \"oneoff digital single,\" the 16minute \"Witchhunt Suite for WWII\". He started the piece in 2001, right after the terrorist attacks of September 11 (eventually selling a CDR of it at shows in 2007). This is a recently rerecorded version, but it retains his early penchant for cultural collage. Samples of George Bush speeches and news reports mix with lyrics that rhyme \"Bin Laden\" with \"Sodom\" and dadaist war chants like \"Building big bomb/ Building the bombs/ Building bombs.\" The song's video offers even more retro spew, hacking together 9/11 imagery, random ads, and tons of VHS debris, with Pink and his crew (including forefather R. Stevie Moore) occasionally keyed over the montage, echoing cableaccess parodists Tim and Eric. It's all pretty fun, both as postmodern patchwork and nostalgia trip. But, at least at first, the only point seems to be the thrill of randomly tossing historicallycharged words and images against the wall. It's tempting to let the point just be the great music \"Witchhunt Suite\" is intensely catchy, and its length allows Pink to stretch good ideas into better ones, moving from tight jamming to slow keyboard meditations to freakedout climaxes. Still, you'd hope there'd be more to a 9/11 concept piece than awesome tuneage. On further listens, there are points where \"Witchhunt Suite\" transcends the sum of its hooks. Take a moment when Pink moans, \"the human race is an invention of the West,\" over a cycling keyboard. The obvious dig is that the first world has marginalized the rest of the planet, but Pink's bigger point seems to be that everything is a construct. Whether art is random memories or finely tuned narrative, it's all fiction, a way of artificially ordering things that in reality are much messier. He's also implying that cheesy retropop, especially when it's done this well, can be as political as folk or punk. After all, if the whole human race is an invention, certainly genres are, too. Having shot that conceptual hole into \"Witchhunt Suite\", Pink fills it with a chorus that's ironic and yet somehow beyond irony: \"Gonna get 'em/ We got 'em/ We gotta!\" He's clearly taunting the childishness of treating world politics like pro wrestling, but there's something joyful in the way he dives into that isolated slogan, freed from the baggage of its specific context. Afterward, Pink quickly drops back into 9/11 collage, randomly rapping about burning bras, \"mass deception,\" and U.S. domination. But at its peaks, \"Witchhunt Suite for World War III\" is more complicated than that. "}
