In an era that's seen the rehabilitation of the criminal (Gary Higgins) and the criminally neglected (Vashti Bunyan), Gasp is to date less in line for rehab than for a first round of addiction. So it's perhaps surprising that we're seeing every vinyl and unreleased Gasp track from their short (19961999) and mythic (the only \"psychedelic powerviolence\" band of all time) incarnation, neatly packaged as An Earwig's Guide to Traveling. In their day, on splits with Deerhoof, Noothgrush, and Volume 11, Gasp mixed Man Is The Bastard powerviolence with Nautical Almanac tape manipulations/loops, pure psychedelic meditations, and gurgling noise. An Earwig's Guide contains all of the above; it is also full of nods to early and mid1990s emo, replete with blast beats, speededup guitars, and full throat screams. Two songs in particular, \"Love for the Retarded Strands\" and \"Crawl Back into the Hole\", are stuffed with emo lyrics and voicecracks, melodic guitar lines, and condenser mic overload. But the sludge, doom, and gloom that Southern Lord has now brought out of the mud are also more than presaged here; \"Shit Colony\" and \"Sore for Days\" out grief Grief, ringing out ominous chords and slugging, oneaminute tom hits. If anyone remembers Gasp today, it would be the aging and stoned Southern California rock kids. Yet that was Gasp only about half the time. As an impatient college radio DJ, I recall skipping around their records trying to find the rock songs; yet every time the needle landed, they were off exploring outer space or lockedgroove tape loops. An Earwig's Guide more than bears this recollection out. The opener here (\"Where Astral Port Splits\") is delicately noisy enough to recall Boris' guitar and drone explorations, and this effect only grows (louder) on later songs like \"Conceived on the 3rd or 4th Satellite\". Even further out there are the eerily calm, warbling tape cries of \"Uranus Is Heaven\" and the waterdrenched gurgle of \"Castle Sounds for the Electrical West\". Enigmatic and distracted now as they were then, Gasp's songs refuse to settle or come into focus. Their moment seems only slightly more likely to arrive now; perhaps, in another five or ten years, we'll be ready. "}
