{"label":" Roc-A-Fella","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/7685/homepage_large.e2946df8.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Tom Breihan","artist":"Beanie Sigel","title":"The B.Coming","text":" The first thing you need to know about The B.Coming is that nearly every track has a guest rapper or two, and nearly every one of these guest spots is perfect emcees playing to their strengths, finding their voices, bringing their Agames. Redman spits raw maniacal gorilla mayhem all over \"One Shot Deal\". Bun B brings his gravelly authoritative drug stories to \"Purple Rain\". Twista contributes what may be his alltime greatest guest verse to \"Gotta Have It\", wrapping his dazzling machinegun flow around Chad Hamilton's snare shuffle with James Brown timing and Louis Armstrong nuance. A lot of very talented rappers have worked hard to make sure The B.Coming is something special. The second thing you need to know about The B.Coming is that none of these guest verses is the least bit important to the success of the album. It's nice to have them around, but the album would not suffer at all without them. Only two things matter here: the production, which is masterful, and Beanie himself, a virtuoso of lonely, bitter desperation. Beans recorded the album in the weeks between being found guilty on a federal gun charge and beginning his oneyear sentence. When that sentence ends, he'll stand trial for attempted murder. He could be inside for a long, long time. Fittingly, The B.Coming is suffused with a sense of dread and regret and emptiness. \"Wanted (On the Run)\" is based on a standard rap theme life on the lam but Beans attacks the track like it was \"Life During Wartime\", breathlessly painting a bleak picture: \"You never see the daylight/ Jakes get on your tail, never let 'em see the brake light\" a stark contrast from guest Cam'ron's blithe confidence. On the searing, gospelinfused track \"Lord Have Mercy\", he begs God for understanding and forgiveness: \"I do my dirt so my kids can see heaven on earth/ But the pain on my heart weighs heavy, it hurt\". But on the next track, the ominously cinematic \"Flatline\", he's snarling, \"Had to try to show a nigga what the metal do/ But didn't succeed; the nigga still breathing.\" Even on \"Look at Me Now\", his song for the haters, Sigel sounds defiant and weary; there's not an ounce of joy in his voice. The album's producers weave a grand, sweeping tapestry to give Sigel's lament the heft and majesty it deserves. Like Ghostface's The Pretty Toney Album, The B.Coming swims in the sad signifiers of 70s soul: glistening strings, weeping guitars, swollen horns. On \"Feel It in the Air\", producer Heavy D has nothing but mournful noir saxophones for ya, baby. Ty Fyffe slathers \"Change\" in swooning, melodramatic violins. On \"Wanted (On the Run)\", da Neckbones give the chipmunksoul treatment to Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive\", mining that track's theatrical sweep with stunningly funky results. Even \"Gotta Have It\", the album's only remotely clubready track, drowns in an ugly, metallic synth wash. The tracks build on each other, swirling into a symphony of pain, a fitting soundtrack to one man's dark days. "}
