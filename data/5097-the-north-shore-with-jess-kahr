{"label":" Darla","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/5033/homepage_large.caa74cc6.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Chris Ott","artist":"Manual / Jess Kahr","title":"The North Shore","text":" There's a fine line between captivating ambient music and anecdotal videogame soundtracks. You could blame FSOL and Moby, whose Lifeforms and Ambient LPs were largely indistinguishable from Myst and The 7th Guest, but the newagevs.ambient dichotomy goes back to Ray Lynch and Mike Oldfield. Shadowfax or Seefeel: You decide.Jonas Munk made a quick name for himself in the overexposed downtempo electronica scene: A sonic prodigy with a keen ear for distance and decay, his renown was more than justified by a stellar debut 12inch and two expansive guitarandglitch albums for the preeminent Morr Music imprint. Impressively architectural and at once solipsistic in his pensive moping, Munk's best clickbeat dreampop ballads recorded as both Manual and Limp are still the stuff daydreams are made of.But, owing to frustration with his creative process, the scene he was tied to, or perhaps music itself, MunkasManual slid into disinterested repetition on a split disc with duplicitous careerist Alexander Perls (aka Icebreaker International, aka the appalling Circ) before retreating into compositionally slight ambience with last year's hitandmiss Isares EP.With a superior back catalog as buttress, The North Shore could have brushed aside Manual's recently faltering material, serving as a launching point for the second phase of Munk's career, but it seems the sophomoric synth missteps of Isares were indications, not aberrations. Worse, these drawnout mood pieces are often peppered with nature sounds (crickets, birds, lapping waves), and lacking the requisite patience of Brian Eno or Richard James' pure ambient pieces, make for forced meditation.Leading with an incongruous, junior varsity tribute to Markus Popp, \"Always Alone\" presents a scratchedup, strippeddown remix of Manual's bynow familiar guitar and synth moans; sans the diverting percussion that anchored past waves, and lacking the meticulous theoretical overview of Popp's Oval pieces, this eightminute miasma just sounds like a CD skipping. Perhaps it's unfair to hold Munk to the chaotic digital genius of \"Do While\", but, it's been the glitch template for 10 years, and for good reason.Without the ticktock of its opening click track, The North Shore fades irretrievably into cinematic overture, a subVangelis relaxation tape begging you to clean the house, write that paper, or read the news. It's a rare failure that music makes you realize you're wasting valuable time, but Munk's struck wan gold with the flat frequencies and Yamaha presets dulling his stab at ambient austerity. By the time he's switched out the Zen chimes for Pan Sonic eardrum buzz (\"Eleda\"), incredulity precludes any curiosity: The North Shore relies on Jiminy crickets and Blade Runner bells to a fault, its referential and monotonous palette unable to deliver on the cover art's promissory bliss.
