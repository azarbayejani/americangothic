{"label":" Rough Trade","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/16076/homepage_large.dadb4706.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Ian Cohen","artist":"British Sea Power","title":"Valhalla Dancehall","text":" Unlike the vast majority of bands who rose up around 2003 reviving strains of UK postpunk, British Sea Power actually have a sense of humor, albeit one that's usually way too arcane for the casual listener. 2008's Do You Like Rock Music? was good for a chuckle at its title and not much else, and the band claims \"Serge Gainsbourg, and Ralf und Florianera Kraftwerk with a sprinkle of Stock, Aitken, and Waterman\" as primary sonic signposts for Valhalla Dancehall acts they sound absolutely nothing like at all, parodying the ridiculously overblown PR bait that hopes lazy reviewers run with it anyway. Now, irony and winking humor does have a place in this grandiose, healthemasses rock music just witness Zoo TVera U2. But British Sea Power are not U2. They're too prickly and esoteric for that. Valhalla's bristling opener, \"Who's in Control?\", instead recalls the strident politicking and acerbic lyrics of tourmates Manic Street Preachers. It kicks off a promising first third that often recalls why their most popfriendly album was accurately called Open Season; here, the hooks and melodies of \"Stunde Null\" and \"We Are Sound\" accurately embody the thrill of experiencing the vast expanse of nature. In between, the simmering piano epic \"Georgie Ray\" finds British Sea Power finally figuring out how to sublimate their quirkier sensibilities into arenalevel hooks. But while \"stunde null\" is a German term for the zero hour before a major military operation, ironically, the moment the song of the same title finishes, the chances of making good on that promise end. I don't get the band's personal attachment to \"Mongk II\" (the first in the series appeared on Zeus EP), as its motorik merely drones and buzzes like a handheld power drill, while the shabby Pulp rip of \"Luna\" serves as a bridge to the vaporous hangover of \"Baby\". After that particularly dull run, first single \"Living Is Easy\" gives the record a necessary jolt toward its homestretch. But just as quickly, BSP are neckdeep in the turgid repetition of \"Cleaning Out the Rooms\" ad on the way to 11 numbing minutes of \"One More Now\". As long as British Sea Power continue to exist on their singular plane, it's easy to admire and probably overrate them for their ambition, and if there were a way to figure out just how \"vintage Playboy magazines, population control, crazy golf, Dadaist artist Kurt Schwitters, hedonism, nature, and 'French Hitchcock' HenriGeorges Clouzot\" supposedly served as the inspirations for Valhalla Dancehall, perhaps it might honor the investment it desperately strives for instead of painting British Sea Power as a band with interesting thoughts that don't make it to the actual music. But I worry that their wit was obvious from the start when they named their debut The Decline of British Sea Power, which is proving its clairvoyant gallows humor with every album. "}
