There's not going to be any stories of how I patronized the laundromat before I listened to this album. So, here, this is what you need to know: Café Tacuba is one of the best bands in the world. When their eponymous debut saw release in 1992, there was certainly an overwhelming supposition that Café Tacuba was destined for greatness, but by 1999's doubledisc Reves/Yosoy, it was incontestably clear that this band deserved accolades of the highest order. Their latest, Cuatro Caminos, is one of the best albums. (That sentence was not missing a clause or specification.) Although the band sprang to life from the same movement that spawned Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Maldita Vecindad, most of the guitar lines on Cuatro Caminos are spiraling, elegiac edges that sound like vintage Pavement and Calexico. \"Cero y Uno\" introduces this tone, but things don't heat up till the simmering hootenanny \"Eo\" a euphoric approximation of The Clash's \"Brand New Cadillac\" if it spat up sound effects and circus music atop dense polyrhythms in a Vegas sex shop. But Café Tacuba play two minutes of it and get out, switching instead to \"Mediodía\". The song fully captures the expressive elasticity of frontman Élfego Buendía's voice, which can be abrasively mocking and tender in the same utterance, converting every punk song into a ballad and viceversa. A sea shanty that swells to incorporate chimes and orchestration amidst the cracking and murmuring of the floorboards, \"Mediodía\" is a lamenting dirge that never begins to approach melodrama. \"Qué Pasará\" creates a sort of skametal that sounds far better than my term for it. I'm not going to deceive anyone; there's a lot of ska here. But even The Clash had to play a few reggae songs now and then, and this ain't your father's thirdwave; \"Recuerdo Prestado\" is a menacing bounce that erodes into a catastrophe of a solo. There are two startling Indianinfluenced breaks on the album (both of which, yes, employ tape loops and backwards guitars). The first is the chorus to \"Camino y Vereda\"; the second is the IrishIndian folksong \"Hola Adiós\" (the name is a clear allusion to \"Hello Goodbye\"). \"Eres\" is unabashedly classic 70s rock, a sunsplattered villa with the best Spanish guitar line in a rock song since Naked Raygun's \"Vanilla Blue\". The epic centerpiece, \"Encantamiento IxFAtil\", begins with sparse, echoing piano and plaintive humming before Joselo Rangel unleashes a cuttingly frosty guitar line that, by itself, eclipses most of the last Godspeed album. Indeed, Café Tacuba is a band that fully acknowledges its debt to other musical legacies while remaining true to their own wholly unique vision. There are undoubtedly a few problems, or a potential for problems, on the album. \"Puntos Cardinales\" bends terrifyingly close to bad Björk territory, but is salvaged when the chorus turns into the strangest disco hit never to come out of 1979, and \"Soy o Estoy\" is too insignificant and cute to matter in the company of the rest of these songs. The album's not terribly coherent, either, as a result of its diversity there are songs on here that make little to no sense upon first listen (\"Tomar el Fresco,\" \"Eo\"), but rarely any moment at which this iconoclasm undermines the group's melodiousness. Yet, despite its minor flaws, Cuatro Caminos ranks among the most innovative and soulful fulllengths to see release this year, the rare albums on which a fantastically popular group with a firm grasp of their direction and sound is able to produce some of their most memorable and mesmerizing songs without sacrificing any of their experimentation and audacity.
