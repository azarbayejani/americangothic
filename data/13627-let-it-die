{"label":" Kill Rock Stars","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/14643/homepage_large.2f886274.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Stuart Berman","artist":"The Shaky Hands","title":"Let It Die","text":" The Shaky Hands are one of a million rock bands who cite the Beatles as an inspiration, but the influence runs deeper than just the swirly guitar solos, bouncy piano lines, and buoyant harmonies woven into their songs frontman Nicholas Delffs is probably one of the few Fab Four acolytes who can claim a soulcleansing India retreat of his own. The effect of the trip was not so much musical rather than experiment with sitars, tablas, and eastern modalities, the Portland band's third album, Let It Die, is actually their most straightforward set to date. But amid Let It Die's ragged barband workouts, you hear a singer who's had time to peacefully ponder his place in the world, and question the predominant Western values of ratrace competitiveness and material acquisition.Let It Die isn't dramatic enough to count as a midlifecrisis record, but the album is consumed with midlife stasis: references abound to aging, setting suns, and flames dying out. And yet, that the Shaky Hands opt to wrap these anxieties in unfussy, steadyasshegoes rockers that suggest a certain shruggedshoulder resignation, forsaking the jittery energy and textural nuance of 2008's Lunglight for more surfacelevel classic rock comforts. But while the laissezfaire quality of Delffs' raspy voice makes him an eminently likable mouthpiece, the Shaky Hands aren't an especially incendiary rock'n'roll band: Delff's titletrack rant is backed by a standardissue Rolling Stones strut that doesn't waver for four versechorus cycles; the cruisecontrolled workout \"Caught in the Storm\" splits the difference between HaightAshbury 1967 and the Bowery 1977, but stops cold just as it seems to be accruing some force. Only on the pianopounded stomper \"Slip Away\" does the band exude an intensity that matches the frustration heard in Delffs' lyrics.After kicking out the jams (however casually) on the album's first half, the Shaky Hands simmer down even more on Let It Die's second side, downshifting into cowpoke laments like \"Don't Fail Me Now\" and, with \"Gonna Hold You Tonight\", a rather blatant attempt at a couplescuddling, lighterwaving acoustic ballad. But the band's playful spirit is still evident in the winsome, pianorolled lullaby \"Already Gone\", while the album's theme of deadend ennui is best manifested on the bittersweet \"Allison and the Ancient Eyes\", whose deceptively cheery janglepop dressing only makes the unfulfillment described within seem all the more tragic. So, in search of spiritual salvation, Delff looks once again to the Beatles namely, John Lennon and George Harrison as he transforms the imaginenopossessions rhetoric of closing piano ballad \"Leave It All\" into a fullon Hare Krishna hymn. Let It Die may speak of the sour times, but, in the end, at least Delffs has found his sweet lord. "}
