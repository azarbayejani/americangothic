{"label":" Soul Jazz","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/1976/homepage_large.91310933.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Scott Plagenhoef","artist":"Various Artists","title":"600% Dynamite","text":" About a year after the most recent addition to its outstanding Dynamite series, Soul Jazz Records has finally released the latest chapter, 600% Dynamite. For those who aren't familiar with the Teflon label's releases, the Dynamite records are a crosssection of Jamaican music, past and present. Rather than cramming what can be an exhausting sound to some listeners into genreoriented compilations (as the Trojan cutprice threedisc boxes do), Soul Jazz strives to present an eclectic look at the rich history of Jamaican music. The result is that instead of the monolithic nature of many comps, the Londonbased label combs the archives of Studio One, the famed label run by Coxsone Dodd and presents something for everyone. The label offers a chance for people to check out the variety of Jamaican music and determine what they favor from the likes of ska, rocksteady, reggae, roots, soul crossovers, DJs, lover's rock, dancehall, ragga, dub, and so forth. So far, 100% is the one for completists and 200% was the headturner that expanded into dub and featured a solid mix of classics and lesserknown tracks. Perhaps the best introduction to the series, though, is 300%, which has the highest strike rate but features a lot of wellknown tracks and compilation fodder. It's the place to start for the Jamaican music novice, but may prove superfluous to some longtime listeners. Followup 400% nearly matches the quality of its predecessor, but features many more lesser known tracks it's the pick for the connoisseur. Last year's 500% expanded to include dancehall and ragga while still maintaining a high hitmiss ratio. Not surprisingly, 600% picks up where 500% left off, leaning heavily on dancehall. It kicks off with a 2003 version of Barrington Levy's dancehall classic \"Under Mi Sensi\". Although a great track, it's a slightly regrettable choice because it also appears on both Ragga Ragga Ragga 2003 and The Biggest Dancehall Anthems 2003, the two compilations that casual observers of dancehall would most likely track down to get a solid crosssection of this sometimes difficulttofollow scene. What the inclusion of \"Under Mi Sensi\" does do, however, is continue the series' dialogue between tracks over different discs, highlighting the incestuous and backscratching nature of Jamaica music. (The original \"Under Mi Sensi\" was featured on 400% Dynamite). Despite the presence of that update (and other popular favorites, such as Dennis Brown's \"Westbound Train\" and Yabby You's \"Conquering Lion\"), the track most familiar to most listeners will be the Johnny Osbourne's Winston Rileyproduced \"Ready or Not\", the inspiration for the Fugees track of the same name. Osbourne's warm, mellifluous vocals are also featured on the uncharacteristically frantic, almost scat of the lowrent disco \"Budy Bye\". The underrated Winston Riley also provides Sister Nancy's \"Transport Connection\" and he outdoes his \"Ready or Not\" with Prince Mohammed's \"Come Mek a Rub a Dub\". Osbourne\"s \"Budy Bye\" is representative of most of the compilation's dancehall sounds. Rather than the sometimes harsh and masculine raggavocaled dancehall that's currently at a commercial and artistic peak, 600% mostly highlights the sweeter, more feminine side of dancehall sort of the twostep to ragga's grime garage. The sweetvoiced Tenor Saw pitches in with the soulful, horndriven \"Golden Hen\". Cynty & The Monkees' \"Lady Lady\" (produced by Lee Perry) draws a line between gospelinspired soul and girlgroup music. Even the harshest ragga track, Papa San's \"Give Her the Credit\" is praising the feminine (but, playfully, only \"when she deserve it\") with a choppedup beat that's part Public Enemy (literally) and part Todd Edwards. Elsewhere, Lloyd Chalmers' cheeky, protodub fascination with playful sounds and a bit of echo is highlighted on Tall T & The Touchers' \"Touch the President\" and Chalmers' group, The Uniques, pays tribute to another regal figure on \"Queen Majesty\". (The In Crowd's \"His Majesty Is Coming\" is also included, but they're anticipating spiritual guidance rather than any political figure.) Slanted heavily toward early dancehall and more soulful vocals than many of the previous additions, 600% Dynamite sort of tilts some scales by dropping roots and ska music from its lineup. It's another outstanding and worthy addition to the series one that thankfully shines a light on a great number of lesserknown gems. Soul Jazz's inclusion here of primarily rocksteady and dancehall tracks is fitting. Those are the Jamaican sounds that seem to be getting the most critical scrutiny and praise at the moment, demonstrating that the label has its finger on the pulse of the now just as surely as it does on that of the past.
