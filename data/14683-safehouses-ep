{"label":" R&S","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/15742/homepage_large.d42540fc.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Larry Fitzmaurice","artist":"Pariah","title":"Safehouses EP","text":" As far as songwriting is concerned, starting with the vocal melody and working your way from there isn't exactly a novel concept. Regardless, it was a bit of a surprise when Arthur Cayzer, the UK postdubstepper who works as Pariah, revealed to me that his beatbuilding process usually begins with a vocal sample: \"I find that vocals make it much easier for me to connect emotionally with a tune, so I guess it makes sense that I have taken to using them in almost every tune I've written.\"I've never really thought of the genres Cayzer works in as being particularly voicecentered, but maybe it's time for that to change. He counts Burial and James Blake, two likeminded artists who also showcase some sort of prominent vocal style in their work, as influences and that influence is definitely apparent to a point on Cayzer's debut EP, Safehouses. Save for the closing title track, all of the cuts here feature vocal samples in some way, whether it be the choppedup cries within \"Crossed Out\" or the ghostinthemachine moans folded within \"Railroad\".Cayzer isn't just an effective imitator, though; he's doing something distinctly different from his peers here in terms of presentation. Burial shrouds his melodies in bombshelter lockstep rhythms, while Blake usually turns vocal lines into putty in his hands, amorphously draping them over whatever screwed rhythm he's dumbing out to in his own mind; Cayzer, by contrast, presents his melodies nakedly, with precious few effects applied. This stylistic approach is aided by the pristine production at work here; every rhythmic hit and clapping backbeat sounds crisp and sharp almost the polar opposite of the bitrateblown terrorjuke of Werk Discs head Actress' fascinatingly complex release earlier this year, Splazsh.The most stunning aspect of Safehouses isn't any singular stylistic tic, though: it's the overall sweep of the thing. Cayzer works through a breadth of subgenres the bass music of \"The Slump\", \"Prism\"'s whomping acidhouse squelch, the digitized hiphop clap of \"CBeams\", and most impressively, the Gasrecalling ambient smother of the title track. That he's able to incorporate so many recognizant signifiers while transcending pastiche is impressive; the fact that he's done so while moving light years away from his breakout single, last year's \"Detroit Falls\", is astounding.
