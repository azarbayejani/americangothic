For some reason, indie guys don't usually make mixtapes even though they should. When Slug from Atmosphere and Murs from Def Jux/Living Legends feel like ditching emorap for softfocus dudetalk, they have to go and put out a whole album under a different name. And really, that's fine; I'm just glad they're doing this stuff at all. Both of these guys are famous for making grand, ambitious statements about their love lives or casual racism, Heavy Issues. They aren't so much famous for being able to rap really well, but that doesn't mean they can't. Most of Lisa Bonet is just on some ignorant rap shit, sex jams and effortless commonsense (not Common Sense) battlerap on top of squelchy, greasy fake Gfunk from Atmosphere producer Ant. Here's Slug: \"Thug white girl, suburban black hippie chick/ Punk rock straightedge, hiphop pothead/ Invite em all over for a mosh pit in my bed.\" And here's Murs: \"She don't have to grow up with the same type of hardheads/ Think she a Blood cuz her boyfriend's car red.\" Or more to the point, here's Murs again, delivering the closest thing the album has to a mission statement: \"It's frontyard politics/ We talk a lot of shit/ Who we wanna fight, which broads we wanna hit.\" And so it goes on; the two rip mics over rippling 70s copshowtheme bongos on \"Early Mornin' Tony\" and beat the Young Gunz at their own game on the clicky, sidelong pimp jam \"Breaker Down Like a Shotgun\". And when they do get heavy, like on the thick, stormy confession \"Marvin Gaye\" (Slug: \"Open apology for anyone who follows me/ Didn't realize I was a selfmade powerfreak\"), it doesn't last. A track later, they're talking fun Swingers bullshit over cheesedout 80s synths on \"Life Vegas\". Other than a couple of throwaway skits where they talk condescendingly to girls on the phone, Felt 2 is pretty great. There's a sense of relief, like they've been doing this chestbeating thing for too long and they're relieved to figure out that they still have some knucklehead in them. And so when they inevitable Anticon moment does come on the last two songs, when Slug and Murs finally plunge back into the confessional, it feels wellearned, like they can go back to this stuff secure in the knowledge that they're still great rappers. And, you know, they're really good at this emorap stuff, too.  "}
