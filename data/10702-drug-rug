And if their love is a tenuous peg to hang an album on, tell that to fellow Cantabridgians Damon & Naomi or Major Stars' Wayne & Kate. Since these two are each other's whole world and there are only two of 'em, after all it shouldn't be much of a shock that their debut splits some. That is to say, you've got your drunken, mostly Sarah Croninvoiced caterwaulers: CocoRosie covering the Carter family, maybe; and then you've got your singing deepintoyourbandmate'seyes crooners, which are more lush and domestic and by process of elimination probably belong to Tommy Allen, Cronin's bandmate and boyfriend. Like a good couple, though, they double up on nearly every vocal, so who knows exactly. More Moldy Peaches than Matt & Kim, to keep up with this m/f duo thing, there's not a lot of celebration of love in song to Drug Rug. \"For The Rest of Your Life\" yips and yawls in the kind of underwater fidelity you'd get from a 78, which matches up pretty well with the duo's professed interest in Hank Williams and June Carter before she married Johnny. \"Lie, Lie, Lie\" clanks and jingles and croaks like a Joanna Newsom outtake if Newsom's harp was a quartersize guitar and her voice was a bit more childlike; Cronin also spits the same sort of complicated fairytale narrative, which is incongruous, since by the next song, \"Cut the Meat\", the two of them are back out on the porch with their bare feet mashing the earth.  But if stretches of Drug Rug tremble and pose like a child playing dressup, the record eventually gets assertive. \"Day I Die\" and \"Alright\" are chirpy, gliding Beatlesesque marching tunes that have the kind of joy to them you get the feeling DR would like to express in every song, not just a couple of them. And \"Tiny People\" is their curledup gem and album finisher: \"You don't have to worry, you don't have to panic no more.\" Take your own advice and you'll be fine.  "}
