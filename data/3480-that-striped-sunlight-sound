This live album comes like midday sun filtering through miniblinds: barelythere slits, perfectly understated kind of cool (temperaturewise) sunny days alongside major chances of rain. And it comes with proof of what the GoBetweens do best: the opposite of cloying perfectly aware, grownup, and bittersweet. The lowkey \"Black Mule\" and \"Clouds\" wouldn't otherwise resemble soldout show material, but here spouted not from the mouths of babes but fullgrown old dudes they're perfect, somehow. Sure we could gripe about the lack of favorites (where's \"Dive for Your Memory\"?), but let's be grateful for what this is: After a long dry spell, \"Spring Rain\" has been a long time coming: \"Don't know where I'm going/ Don't know where it's blowing/ But I know it's finding you.\"\"You\" meaning us, of course. Handclapped, whistled interims are proof that no band is an island, and the GoBetweens are no exception to the rule: On That Striped Sunlight Sound, fans and cheesy concertcheers are as indispensable as the guitars themselves. While those who accuse the band of overcultishness might cite the record's idiosyncratic and nerdy overload the GoBees, after all, perform debut 1978 single \"Karen\", call \"James Joyce\" the \"right choice,\" and namedrop great Russians in that deadon line from Oceans Apart (\"Why do people who read Dostoyevsky look like Dostoyevsky?\") there's something bigger and fartherreaching than geek rock at work here. Here's what potential and happiness sounds like in the face of rain, and God knows what else. "}
