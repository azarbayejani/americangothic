Agent Julianne Shepherd. Abstract: On the recovered document x2, Tes' uncanny powers were found to include: 1. the ability to spit words faster than the speed of sound; 2. the ability to spit said words in a youthful, nasally, singsongy voice, for long periods of time without oxygen; 3. the ability to make beats appear light and minimal, yet be heavier than bricks; 4. xray vision. It is apparent Tes was not born a mutant; however, the origin of his mutations is still under debate. (Note: in previous reports, Tes himself has noted a change may have occurred at a \"roller rink\" while hearing Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" for the first time; UNDER INVESTIGATION.) According to the dossier, said mutant has been living out his identity undercover; specifically, in the labyrinthine fronds of the Brooklyn underground rap scene. Known associates: Vast Aire (of the known \"Cannibal Ox\" cell) and Afra (a Japanese mutant with the ability to make awesome percussive noises by using his mouth, lips and tongue). In the x2 document, the names \"LoDeck\" and \"DJ Ese\" (investigate: magneto?) came up more than once as conspirators in Tes' mission. This special agent believes x2 to be a highly advanced form of communication. In addition to the subject's vocal powers, whose cadences play a choppy kind of \"jumprope\" code we have yet to decipher, Tes' musical system is also relatively unique. Whereas many previously recovered audio documents have merely been crude or onedimensional keyboard transmissions, Tes has developed a way to combine a minimalist code of rhythms with a delicate aesthetic of melody, often including crackles and whirs derived from ancient human appliances, such as the \"turntable.\" We believe its simple, ominous beauty is meant to throw infiltrators off its trail, while still transmitting information to those advanced mutants who have become familiar with the dialect of \"underground rap\" and the ongoing experiment known as \"Warptouched hiphop.\" We have seen similar types of transmissions in several other cells including those on the \"fresh coast,\" and those operating out of the New York metro area. This geographic connection may in fact be a key to understanding Tes and his fellow operatives, though at times, the subject inflects a tone found in cells of a more southerly location. In the most compelling file, characterized by a humid, soulful melody and marked simply \"New New York\", Tes uses his voice to transmit the following powerful message: \"If you listen to Tes, you know where I'm from/ Fuck where you at, I'm the original one.\" This homebase pride permeates the message of many other files in x2, such as \"Late to Work\", which combines a certain work ethic (\"Fool Time\": \"Don't watch the clock, it's a waste of time/ And even if they pay you, don't make it by nine\") with a feeling of societal imprisonment (\"My Receiver\": \"Get compelled/ To propel/ Steppin' through hell/ Tramplin' the fate I was dealt/ Saw both sides but didn't like either/ Chose to block out both with the sound of my receiver/ Good and evil always push their presence on the scene.\" The Agency believes this to be a direct communication.) Conclusion: While potentially dangerous to \"other emcees,\" Tes' x2 document could be an important comrade in human/mutant unity. NOTE: other agents on our team were concerned with the transmission \"I've changed/ Extended my brain/ [indecipherable] Satellite strike like war games/ In the past, I was the future,\" on the file marked \"Change\". However, given his discursive interest in evolution, team consensus holds that Tes is likely to use his powers for good, not evil. STATUS: ALLY CLOSED "}
