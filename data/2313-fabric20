{"label":" Fabric","artwork":"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/2294/homepage_large.2d55f3f4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jess Harvell","artist":"John Digweed","title":"Fabric20","text":" This one is problematic. Fabric with its slickster graphics, awkward metal tins, and terminal hesitation between hauteur and crowdpleasing is as responsible as anything for the continuing gentrification of dance music as hipster lifestyle accessory. Friends rave (no pun intended, swear to God) about the London club for which the series is named, and a few of these mixes you can't beat with a wiffleball bat. But there's something offputting about what basically amounts to ultracheesy Ministry of Sound Annual comps (big up DJ Sammy and Darude) with a kind of iD/Nylon/Wallpaper sheen superimposed.Fabric20 is probably the most blatant case yet of this series wanting it both ways. Let's get one of the biggest, blandest DJs in the world and give him a crate of microhouse we boosted from the Voigt brothers' yard sale. Godlike genius producer Ewan Pearson probably didn't know Fabric was planning this when he ribbed on his blog that a new Perlon track could be played \"safe in the knowledge that in nine months time Erick Morillo et al won't. Hurrah!\" But there's a strain of \"underground house\" that's getting closer and closer to \"big room\" prog/trance on its own, much of it spearheaded by Kompakt. (Bite your tongue.) So it's not surprising Michael Mayer's remix of Superpitcher's \"Happiness\" mopes in after the disc's climax. What is surprising is that Digweed didn't go with even trancier Kompakt gear like Magnet's \"Rising Sun\" or Mayer's \"Privat\". We join our program already in progress with the gorgeously stereosensitive atmospherics of Pete Moss' \"Strive To Live (16b Mix)\". (Next time I'm over at Ashton and Demi's in the isolation tank, I'll request this.) Then the beats arrive before we've put our makeup on and we're gliding through Adam Johnson's unobtrusive \"Traber\" (zzz) before Richard Davis gets his Martin Gore on to Repair's \"Forgive & Forget\". Then Diggy sends me all funny by dropping the breakbeat and tuff little sax riff of DJ RaSoul's \"True Science\". The rest of the mix isn't particularly micro or even that hip just \"solid\" (in the same sense that a Ford Taurus is) house music that doesn't earn a differentiated genre tag. (Solid House would be wholly redundant without the existence of the adobe.) I couldn't remember a single thing about it when it came time to write this review, but, then again, I usually nod off after \"Fascination Street\" and that doesn't make Disintegration any less of a stone classic. Err... "}
