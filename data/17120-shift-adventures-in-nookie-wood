{"label":" Double Six","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/18308/homepage_large.be0e997c.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jayson Greene","artist":"John Cale","title":"Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood","text":" On \"December Rain\", the sixth song on John Cale's new album, Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood, Cale sings a line about \"Google getting on your nerves.\" He fails to elaborate, so we never find out what he thinks might irk us about Google: Google Docs (which frequently erases important data, I've noticed)? Google Reader (cramped, visually unappealing)? He just says \"Google.\" The fact that he sings it through AutoTune gives the moment a whiff of parody. Cale has been on artrock's cutting edge for decades; he's the only person at the center of the tag cloud \"John Cage,\" \"Aaron Copland,\" \"Lou Reed,\" \"Patti Smith,\" and \"Sham 69.\" His cover of LCD Soundsystem's \"All My Friends\" rivals the original. You don't want to hear him sound out of touch. Then, of course, there's that album title, which exists, magnificently, beyond the realm of normal taste and judgment. \"Nookie Wood\", to judge from Cale's heavybreathing delivery on the titular song, is a dark, fearsome place where beasts roam and men are devoured whole. Nookie Wood is definitely strange, in other words. What it is not, sadly, is terribly interesting: Much like David Byrne and St. Vincent's recent Love This Giant collaboration, Shifty Adventures feels wellcomposed, immaculately arranged, and curiously inert. Part of the problem comes from Cale's production choices, which feel less of this era than the late 1980s and early 90s: The boxy drum sounds, textured surface, and tackystiff keyboard sounds remind me, specifically, of Peter Gabriel's Us. The adultcontempo sheen doesn't do the songs here, which are crawling with interesting sounds, any favors. Cale works hard, banging pianos and MPCs, running drum sounds backwards, and filling the margins with glitches and loops. His viola snakes and mingles with often lightly AutoTuned voice. But the album's lacquered surface coats the chaos and imposes unwelcome order. It's like watching a man fail to tear his way out of an overstarched dress shirt. If Cale had brought more memorable songs, Shifty Adventures might have fought its way out of this middle distance. But the songwriting is meandering and vague, feeling less written than whittled out of an arsenal of studio tricks. Like Brian Eno's recent solo work for Warp, Shifty Adventures has an allframe, nopainting feeling: Lead single \"I Wanna Talk 2 U\" (coproduced by Danger Mouse), is rote, dutiful midtempo acoustic rock, without a single unexpected turn. Cale sometimes pricks the air with a soulful line \"I always held on to the thought/ That if they loved you long enough/ They'd find out what was missing when they finally called your bluff,\" is the mournful opening salvo on \"Hemingway\" but vast stretches of the album amble by without giving you a good reason to pay attention, other than to note a tactile, stickysounding drum loop here (\"Face to the Sky\") or a nice sunburst of acoustic guitars there (\"Living With You\"). This is what happens, sometimes, when a producer gets lost in the studio and forgets to write an album, and Shifty Adventures feels more like a collection of gadgets than songs. "}
