{"label":" Merge","artwork":"http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/6326/homepage_large.db9517e4.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Brandon Stosuy","artist":"Portastatic","title":"Bright Ideas","text":" In one sense, Mac McCaughan's repetitions are a key to his longevity. Structurally, he makes excellent use of runon sentences for exclamatory emphasis; doubled lines (or more often quadrupled hiccups) propel his best songs. The oldie \"My Noise\" jumps with a row of fluctuating \"It\"'s: \"It rides beside me/ It has no choice/ It's my life/ It is my voice/ It is stupid/ It is my noise.\" This sort of stutter pops up time and again in McCaughan's back catalogue, and judging from Bright Ideas, the sixth Portastatic fulllength in 13 years, he wisely avoids a Mouldian aim at midcareer eclecticism, and continues the practice. The title track's opening lines hinge on their reps: McCaughan adopts an airy Elliott Smith, stuck awhile in clusters of \"I thought\"'s so multitudinous they'd take up too much space for me to quote. Here, as is often the Portastatic case, the point isn't rock catharsis. Superchunk remains that predominant space for songs that make you bounce on your bed, with Portastatic more about introspection. \"Bright Ideas\" fits that lowkey template perfectly, the protagonist resting his head on a pillow rather than using it as a soft weapon at a highspirited slumber party. McCaughan shakes things up a bit (but just a bit) the rest of the way. In indie rock years, McCaughan's approximately 100. Between Merge, which he operates with Superchunk bassist Laura Ballance and various high and lowprofile musical projects the North Carolina icon's rarely out of sight. How does a centurion maintain musical vitality? One approach is to get Conor Oberst to pen your overstated press release. The more valiant option: experiment tastefully and within your limitations. Doing just that on Bright Ideas, McCaughan plays Portastatic for the first time with a full band. Sure, past offerings have included guest spots by SleaterKinney's Janet Weiss and Tony Crow of Lambchop, but this is McCaughan's most realized rock affair. As one would expect with the fuller instrumentation, Bright Ideas is McCaughan's most Superchunkfriendly Portastatic collection. Though with Portastatic dispatches arriving at more regular intervals than rockers from those slack motherfuckers, the difference feels more like semantics than anything else. Unexpectedly, the album features a flurry of decently energized fistpumpers \"Through With People\", \"The Soft Rewind\", and standout \"White Waves\". Each is enjoyable in its way. When McCaughan grows too chill (\"Truckstop Cassettes\"), tiptoes into country (\"Little Fern\"), or lulls a la midtempo Neil Diamond/Crooked Fingers (much of \"I Wanna Know Girls\" ), he drops his raw nasal register, losing what makes his work compelling.Bright Ideas is more pleasant than kickass or inspired. But for an album this deep into his career, at a time when he could start growing aesthetically antsy, McCaughan sticks to a blueprint that works best: He shifts things enough to let us know he's still breathing, avoiding the desperate genrejumping that often afflicts musicians of a certain age.
