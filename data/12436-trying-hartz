Trying Hartz, a 2xCD, 28track bestof collection, is a second point of entry for Danielson newcomers, a guide through his dense, hitormiss preShips affairs, which could be a difficult slog for anyone without either a strong attention span or a long road trip ahead. But they also indicate that Danielson Famile's quirkiness and religious convictions aren't something to \"get past,\" and that, most of all, Ships didn't succeed because it marked out new territory but because of steady improvement in the group's craft.Trying Hartz would have been better served and more useful coming right on the heels of Ships, when curiousity over the band's back catalog was probably at its peak. By this point, curious Ships listeners have likely pillaged Danielson's discography; for those who always knew about the gems lurking on the group's previous LPs, it's hard to imagine the eight live tracks here are a proper substitute for either the originals or one's fond memories of Danielson's communal live singalongs. My own first experience with the Danielson Famile actually was a road trip along with their 2001 LP, Fetch the Compass Kids. Luckily that album, their best preShips, is well represented, though many of my other favorites from the Danielson discography are absent (\"We Don't Say Shut Up\", \"Things Against Stuff\", \"Gorgeous New Age\", \"Flesh Thang\"). The only new tracks are a pair of sixsecond bookends, \"Now Try\" and closer \"Cheer Hart\". The older tracks are bursting with two or threenote organ and keyboard lines, quick rhythms, and halting breaks.Their best songs remind you that they're a family TriDanielson!!! Alpha's \"Rubbernecker\" and Fetch the Compass Kids' \"Good News for the Pus Pickers\" even feature shoutouts highlighting a Danielson member or their instrument and the live tracks remind the audience they're part of that family as well. On \"Don't You Be the Judge\", Smith asks the crowd to think of their own verses to the song. \"I'm gonna call on ya, so you'd better be ready!\" he warns. He had to take the first one himself, but, after the demonstration, audience members volunteer to do the next four.  Most of the tracks are about effort, about making small adjustments toward selfimprovement and understanding others. These can be either funny or serious. \"Rallying the Dominoes\" warns against getting too caught up in your own projects; \"Daughters Will Tune You\" deals with that specific relationship. But there's plenty of humor, too: \"Idiot Boksen\" is about watching too much TV; and Smith sings \"Won't kiss no pottymouth/ Away with pottymouth\" toward the end of halfspokenword oddity \"Pottymouth\". Outlier \"Pottymouth\" aside, the rest of their idiosyncratic sounds seems normal to me but I've been a fan for almost a decade. This collection isn't for fans, but for those who haven't dug deeper than Ships, or for those wrongly convinced Ships was a blip in an otherwise dense and unrewarding discography. "}
