{"label":" Fat Wreck Chords","artwork":"http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/13144/homepage_large.4fce4135.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jason Crock","artist":"Dillinger Four","title":"Civil War","text":" Relative to their poppunk peers, the Minneapolisbased Dillinger Four always seemed angrier, boozier, and too clever by half. They've found a home at the Fat Wreck Chords label and based on their newest, the oftdelayed Civil War, which comes six years after their last studio fulllength they seem to have \"gone political.\" Dillinger Four have been together for almost 15 years, so it makes sense that they'd start to show some signs of maturity. To that end, there's even a song here that starts slow and stays that way for almost two whole minutes. Point being, Dillinger Four are still unmistakably poppunk, from the songs built with a few overdriven power chords to every squeaky pick scrape and \"Hey!\" or \"Whoaoh.\" And they've also managed to keep the little things that have made them distinctive over the years, from their pithy song titles and wry lyrics down to the extraneous prerecorded intros. So if their boisterous edge has tempered somewhat, it's only a tradeoff for more assured songs and lyrics about lost time that feel all the more trenchant now.The band still banks on frequent changeups in rhythm and melody to pull in and surprise listeners. From the very first track, \"A Jingle for the Product\", there are hooks for at least four different songs shoved into under four minutes, from galloping verses to some of those aforementioned rapidfire \"Whoa\"'s and the descending twinguitar lines of its halftime outro. While the lyrics are more politically conscious in a vague, occasionally clumsy way, they're often overshadowed those shoutalong lines the band always uses as punctuation. There are songs tailormade for lifting a beer to (\"Fruity Pebbles\") mixed in with a few potshots at the rich and famous, from the obviously titled \"Parishiltonisametaphor\" to the lessso \"The Art of Whore\". And the politics are sometimes fused with something more personal: \"Minimum Wage is Gateway Drug\" is a majorkey handtomouth anthem that sounds unflappable and genuinely, justifiably pissed off all at once.Civil War shows a band that's matured in some typical ways as if anyone was clamoring for \"broadened perspective\" from these guys and some unexpected and not unwelcome ones. Songs like \"Gainesville\" show the advantages of slowing down and letting the hooks sink for more than a fleeting moment, from its nostalgic lyrics to the callandresponse between vocals and bass on a muted, simmering rhythmic shift. There's yet to be a good answer on how irreverent punk bands are supposed to grow up. While this kind of cautious refinement may not be the most exciting or innovative approach, coming from the Dillinger Four, it does at least seem honest. "}
