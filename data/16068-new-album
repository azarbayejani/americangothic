They've thrown plenty of curve balls since forming in 1992, but after 2005's Pink, they sped up the shifts and got weirder. The trio is also more willing to revisit its past and recontextualize its output with new styles and approaches. (It can often feel like an archival project, or like you're spying on someone else's déjà vu.) Atsuo (drums/vocals), Wata (guitar/vocals), and Takeshi (bass/vocals) were quiet after 2008's forgettable grabbag Smile, but they've made up for the silence with three 2011 releases, Attention Please, Heavy Rocks (which echoes the 2002 release of the same name), and New Album, a generically titled collection that reinterprets tracks from those other records: \"Party Boy\", \"Hope\", \"Spoon\", and \"Les Paul Custom '86\" from AP; \"Jackson Head\" and \"Tu, La La\" from HR II. The 10song collection, first released in Japan this past March before this rearranged/remastered version, is their most unabashed pop experiment; offering a dollop of sugary atmospherics and dewy hooks. The band insists on labeling this new angle \"extreme,\" though only because it's an extreme shift by a group best known for its doom metal and fuzzedout rock. (It makes more sense than you might want to assume that they recently toured with New York City dreampop group Asobi Seksu.) Conceptually, they were inspired by the use of Vocaloid software in Japanese pop music: the program takes typed lyrics and turns them into a song sung by \"an imaginary anime character vocalist.\" New Album does have the feel of sumptuous, otherworldly animation. The band usually selfproduces its records but brought on mainstream dance/pop arranger and producer Shinobu Narita, and the guy has a way with Candy Land gloss. All of the Attention Please and Heavy Rocks tracks sound better here chewier, more refined nuggets. But in most cases, it's more a comment on the quality of the other records than a heap of praise for this one. When the formula does succeed, the results do dazzle. \"Spoon\" offers a swirl of shoegaze detailed with chimes, synthesizers, atmospheric female vocals, and various bright, shiny things. In this case, as with NA's other best moments, Boris leave remnants of their usual sound within the gentler field: Biggerthantwee drums, flanged feedback, and a heavy bass hold the elements together. You also get this in the shredding, cascading guitars of the amped \"Tu, La La\" and the mellower closer, \"Looprider\", a new track that comes off like Boris doing Yo La Tengo (via Sonic Youth). The best song, though, is \"Luna\", a rush of gurgling, humming dynamics that continues to hectically spiral upward for its eight minutes and change, creating soaring, stringed, crunchy goodness. (The original appeared on Adult Swim's Metal Swim compilation.) The other real standout kinetic, sunburst opener \"Flare\" didn't appear elsewhere before New Album. But not everything works so well. Drummer/vocalist Atsuo told Rolling Stone the two albums that provided much of the source material were put together from \"one abandoned record.\" You don't often see Boris short on ideas, largely because they can't seem to let them go even if they're running them into the ground. Here, the experiments too often come off as empty or forced: Decadent on the surface, hollow at the core. The slow, stoned bedroompsych of the new song \"Pardon?\" bores. The sketchy, dorky techno pop of Attention Please's \"Les Paul Custom '86\" and Heavy Rocks' Jackson Head\" annoy (Boris as 8Bit Muse?). During these stretches, you can hear the band struggling to write songs from outside their area of expertise. A pop song can look like a pop song, but that doesn't mean it is one. And as pretty as it can be, New Album is another minor Boris album in a string of minor Boris albums. "}
