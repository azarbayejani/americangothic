{"label":" self-released","artwork":"http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/6834/homepage_large.3dae55f7.jpg","rating":null,"reviewer":" By Jess Harvell","artist":"Ruff Sqwad","title":"Guns & Roses","text":" Ruff Sqwad love guitars, but there's not a single guitar here. They love hangarsized, doomy, simple melodies played slooooooow, on Rapmaster keyboards that've spent some time in the shed with dad's Krylon. It's not scary or menacing but vaguely silly huge synths cycling in midair, sour and sagging. Not for nothing does MC Tinchy Strider politely suggest on \"Move\" that you bang your head. They probably picked it up through some perverted polyglot of drum & bass smog riffs and southern rap's TransEuro affectations. Wherever they got it, they may be the first act to come prescrewed. (Blame English socialized medicine or the sleepytime effects of steak and kidney pie.) They also love silly bellsandwhistlesstyle tracks like \"Dirty\", featuring the first digitized slide whistle in history. (Hold tight MC Harpo.) These are really throwbacks to batshit hardcore bricolage like HyperOn Experience's \"Imajika\" (\"What's Opera, Doc?\" remade by Davy DMX). Grime's dirty little secret is that it's easier to sell column inches presenting East London as Bartertown 2.0 than admit that frothiness, sweetness, and hope are key parts of its experience. (Not that the MCs help destroy the illusion: Yeah, you're Pablo Escobar in a country with the same gun crime rate as Guam.) The problem with Guns & Roses is that there just aren't enough Ruff Sqwad tracks. For a putative calling card from one of the most powerful crews around, this thing is stuffed bowtostern (geddit?) with U.S. rap instrumentals. Grime crews have inscrutable taste in U.S. rap: Do they really listen to their own music and hear Ludacris' \"Splash Waterfalls\" or Black Rob's \"Whoa\"? I thought grime was supposed to wipe away Britrap's presupposed serfdom to Source/Vibe rules. Grime people: The next time you look to our shores, throw on \"Crunk Music\" or \"Put Your Hood Up\" at +8 and go nuts. Alternately, you could just have faith in the spanking quality of your own music and say, \"fuck you very much\" to a country who doesn't know Dirty Danger from Dame Edna. (Also, could I ask for a moratorium on the sex raps? I don't need to know Oliver Twist's skeeting habits.) They could be saving their best stuff (wot, no \"Anna\"?) for the alwayspromised debut album, thereby considerably devaluing the eBay vultures of 2015. (Not that it did Wiley any good: Nine hundred forty copies, you fuckers!) Bottom line is that you need to at least hear this if you're at all interested in grime, aka the most exciting music on the planet right now. (What else do you have to show for yourselves? The Paw Paw Bears playing courtly lute? Your banging fax machine?) Just be prepared for a national crisis of confidence to the sound of Philly's Most Wanted. "}
