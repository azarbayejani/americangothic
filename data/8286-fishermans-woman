IcelandicItalian songstress Emiliana Torrini is far more than that: Her ululations over the credits to The Two Towers made old Gollum sound like, oops, Björk who, now that you mention it, was offered the job first (and said \"xF6\"). Anyway, Torrini's debut, Love in the Time of Science, was totally more of a Portishead rip. Like, hey, Beth Gibbons from Portishead, Torrini has since ditched the electronic accoutrements for subdued, ostensibly trendproof Eurofolk. Listen, I'm as tired of Nick Drake comparisons as the next jaded rock typist, but on her latest album, Fisherman's Woman, Torrini dons Drake's hushed legacy as eagerly as she recently wore thirdhand beats and Thievery Corporation guest spots. Pensive lead track \"Nothing Brings Me Down\" starts with a droning, fingerpicked acoustic guitar figure, handled capably by producer/collaborator Mr. Dan, and peaks at a soaring wordless vocal straight out of \"Cello Song\". Bass and gentle percussion eventually shuffle in, establishing a spare framework that rarely deviates for the next 11 tracks. A monochrome palette, sure, but when it works it works. For Torrini that's on first single \"Sunny Road\", an aching acousticpop love letter with a melody wellsuited for Torrini's pleasant voice which, by the by, definitely brings to mind Sweden's Stina Nordenstam, second, and fellow folk pixie Joanna Newsom, third, after youknowwho (not Drake). Lyrics aren't Torrini's strongest suit, but she acquits herself well on the catchy \"Heartstopper\", another gossamer number about soulsearching \"with number three still on my plate.\" Torrini's doubletracked harmonies and Dan's supple guitar line on closer \"Serenade\", another highlight, could have come from Wednesday Morning, 3AMera Simon and Garfunkel, whose \"Sound of Silence\" Torrini once covered. Unfortunately, Fisherman's Woman doesn't always work, and its infrequent variations accordions and nautical creaking on the otherwise forgettable \"Lifesaver\", piano instead of guitar on the title track do little to disguise songs that can be as ephemeral as Torrini's voice. Fine, she's not just a Björk knockoff. Full credit, also, for penning the Kylie Minogue hit \"Slow\". But Torrini's folkpop dalliance is as innocuously suited for health spas and pottery classes as any triphop relic. "}
