With the emergence of online commerce centers and message boards, finding and commenting on the best, most obscure artists has become incredibly easy. Rising from the ashes of Hip Hop Infinity and the Anticon doppelganger fallout, Australianborn rapper Sankofa (best known for his collaborative work with the Cunninlynguists and his group, White Collar Criminals) makes his longawaited solo debut with The Rosetta Stone, a record that finally places him above the millions of CDR mic assassins lying in wait. Sankofa is, on first listen, the sum of the largest components of the white underground movement Sole's speedy monotone, Sage Francis' wit and multisyllabic wordplay, Buck 65's gravely voice and introspective rhymes even while his most direct influences lie in the roots of mid90s hiphop icons. His greatest strengths are his strong, unwavering flow and his commanding mic presence, at once booming, memorable and vulnerable.The Rosetta Stone is structured around relatively generic subject matter, for the most part, a wholesale defamation of the mainstream hiphop machine and its proponents, as well as some wellplaced battle rap and esoteric exercises. The most creative tracks are the poignant memorial to his father (\"RDB\") and an industrial upheaval anthem (\"All of Heaven's Angels\"), but even in less powerful moments, his overwhelming talent makes up for his lack of topical variety. However, songs like \"Bill Macy\" (where Sankofa attempts to play a label rep/commercial label salesman) and \"Asphyxia\" (a lame, esoteric subAnticon death march) grate on nerves with their absolute pointlessness. Sankofa is by far at his best in his angrier incarnation. On \"Sunday Morning\", the rap protagonist allows the listener into his starkly distinct battle style, a mix of subtle wordplay and relentlessly dry wit. Over producer Ear Max's stunning mix of bells, chimes and harsh drums, Sankofa takes it to an enemy emcee's hypothetical girl, claiming that he's \"crushed apples and cinnamon/ Strictly in cider\" and that he's \"up in her body cavity with more decay than in NY.\" He caps it with the brag rap statement, \"No smokin' haze, Romeo ropeadope/ I'm chilling in the Pokonos, eatin' Toblerones.\" Unfortunately, the beats often fail to match Sankofa's abilities, especially in achieving a level of cohesion. The major standout is Kno's stellar twist on vocal samples and mesmerizing jazzhop with \"RDB\", while Manic Depressive's heavy crunch funk guitar fits well on \"45 Notches\". Other beats, such as \"Eeyore\" and \"The Making of Believe\", are completely forgettable, while \"4th Wall\" and \"Asphyxia\" border on Anticon piggybacking. The general patchiness here underscores that what Sankofa really needs is to find a production style and stick with it. While it's difficult to find fault with a guy who refers to Penelope Cruz as \"Selma Hayek minus talent, body and sensuality,\" Sankofa could find much greater success by focusing his energies on either the esoteric side of his persona or on a more traditional battle rap angle, as the many sides of his character aren't so much refreshingly varied as difficult to get a handle on. His spotty beat choices and the occasional derivative subject matter hold him back, but his talent is almost staggering, especially given his lack of name recognition in the underground. The Rosetta Stone may be a relatively solid experiment, but Sankofa has yet to discover his personal sound. "}
