It's also one that, like my kitchen table, I've returned to, compulsively and without expectation, for comfort and familiarity. My stupid little bromide, maybe. And what the band two brothers and a friend from Concord, North Carolina lacks in subtlety, they make up for with embarrassing persistence: Song after song, stumbling through country, bluegrass, orchestral pop, and early Beatlesstyle poprock, they never waste a chance to harmonize or wail, to loose one beatdown sentiment after another, to backpat or console. In a world so full of cynicism that it's invisible and one in which anticynics invariably look like thorough dopes it's hard to talk about Emotionalism, their fifth studio album, in a way that isn't hyperbolic. It could stand to be 15 or 20 minutes shorter. Some of the songs, like \"The Ballad of Love and Hate\", are hamhanded without sounding humble, allegories stuffed with pulpit wisdom and so bent on supplying a moral that the characters become abstractions. The Avett's heroes, like the Replacements', aren't clever or nuanced they're most instructive when puking, bawling, or both. Or, like the narrator in \"Will You Return?\", an unwitting bubba to whom shit just happens: \"I open my eyes/ And here's what occurs/ A pretty little girl/ With pretty little curls/ Leans on my mind/ Leans to the side.\" When Emotionalism is good, it's intrusively good, a kind of stopandpause experience that will probably inspire inscrutable phone calls to people you care about \"I just wanted you know how blessed I am,\" and so on which, in turn, will inspire concerned questions from said loved ones about alcohol intake (blame the last thirty years, which made a cultural victim of earnestness). And drunk it is, most of the time messy in sentiment, swooning, impulsive. It's that spirit that offsets the album's contrivances. It's not grisly some of Emotionalism shows off how irritatingly middlebrow and noncommittal altcountry can be but it's not too mannered, either. And the Avetts probably get shot by both sides as a result.  So play the perfunctory cynic through the opening ruminations of \"Die Die Die\", come to flinch at the awshucksisms of \"Paranoia in BFlat Major\" ten minutes later, cry like a bruised teenager by the time you hit \"Salina\", and then find the wherewithal to glorify your bad decisions by \"Pretty Girl from San Diego\". Emotionalism is the analyst who probes the reluctant patient until he splits like a melon.  "}
